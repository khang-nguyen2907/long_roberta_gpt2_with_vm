well i have tried to look up on line what the 10 or 13 herbs are without success. the problem with taking in herbs in general are they are not regulated and many times physicians don't know what the ingredients are. having said that there are not too many products that are found to be harmful to the unborn fetus. plus if you are not feeling well we many times will say it is ok to take different medications during pregnancy. cough drops are one that usually will not cause any specific harm. the real question is when did you take the medication? how much did you take becuase these all have a say if there is any harm to the fetus. in teratology there are three things you must have in order for the fetus to be harmed. 1. the drug must be a known teratogen 2. the dose must be high enough to cause harm 3. the timing must be correct- that period of organogenesis. accutane is the perfect drug that we know is harmful even at the human dose. it has all three characteristics. for you i don't have the exact answer. you should ask your physician to investigate. the real issue is you will find out soon enough when your baby is born. in all likelihood your baby will be just fine.	are ricola cough drops ok to take during pregnancy?

yes. shingles (herpes zoster) follows a particular nerve pathway so the lesions would only be on one side of the public area. if you have not had this problem professionally diagnosed i would strongly suggest that you confirm that this is indeed shingles. shingles can appear anywhere on the body and internally affecting your organs. i am not a doctor but i've had shingles 3 times and i'm on my 4th bout as i write this. i rely on webmd and realize that these are just answers that anybody can write. i'm not a doctor i was a teacher 55 years old in indianapolis indiana. the phd above mr. moser answered this question incorrectly please go to the doctors at webmd or ask your own doctor of course. as i said i am not a doctor but know that two of mr. moser's answers have been incorrect!	can you get shingles only in the pubic area?

so sorry to hear your husband's going through this. nagging rib pain is no fun! yes his symptoms certainly could be caused from leaning on that fence railing while fishing. i hope he reeled in a big one for his trouble! since he's had all the usual heart testing and was told his heart was in good shape i'm going to guess he's got a case of costochondroitis or an injury to the cartilage between his ribs. leaning against a sharp object such as a fence railing could cause a mild tear or irritation of the rib cartilage. rib cartilage will repair itself eventually. unfortunately it may be mighty ouchy until the healing is finished. your husband can take over-the-counter pain relievers such as anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen naproxyn or plain aspirin for the pain. hope this helps!	my husband was leaning on a metal rail and now that part of his chest has been sore for a month. a little over a month a ago he leaned his chest (the part right below left pectoral) on the railing of fence for about a half hour to an hour long while fishing. he has been complaining that that he has constant aching there since he did that. not a sharp pain but just a constant nagging ache. he has since gone to get chest xray ekg bloodwork etc. to rule out his heart and they found nothing. could it be caused by leaning on the rail?

scientists aren't sure what causes migraines including migraines without aura. it's thought that at least two brain chemicals -- serotonin and dopamine -- play a role. the theory is something goes awry in the way these chemicals regulate brain function. this causes the brain and the body's immune system to overreact. when that happens a flood of immune response cells flows through the blood vessels to the brain. the brain's blood vessels open wider to accommodate these cells. then even more chemicals are released to help control the vessels' muscles. the vessels open and constrict. a severe sometimes throbbing headache results. factors suspected of causing migraines include genetics and being overweight. substances behaviors and environment may also trigger migraines. it is known that migraines often run in families. they frequently begin in childhood and worsen through adolescence. although more boys than girls have migraines more adult women than adult men have migraines. over time the number of migraines lessens. migraines become rare after age 50.	what causes a migraine without aura?

"first off let me just clarify that not everyone who takes a diuretic (""water pill"") needs to take a potassium supplement. diuretics come in two general types: potassium-sparing and non-potassium-sparing (also called ""loop diuretics""). most of the newer diuretics are potassium-sparing which means they do not strip potassium from the body the way loop diuretics do. the reason i want to clarify this is because patients who take loop diuretics like lasix (furosemide) should always receive a prescription for potassium from their doctor. if you are taking a diuretic and did not receive a prescription for potassium they you may not need to take any extra potassium. potassium is a key mineral for heart health. but too much or too little potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat. thus it's not always a good idea to take a potassium supplement. if a person wants to make sure they are getting enough potassium they should consider eating potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauces and beans. this is a safer way to get potassium than taking a pill -- unless a medical professional tells you to take a pill. wishing you well!"	how effective is the otc potassium gluconate for copd patients on diurectics?

"osteoporosis can be present without any symptoms for decades because osteoporosis doesn't cause symptoms until bone fractures. moreover some osteoporotic fractures may escape detection for years when they do not cause symptoms. therefore patients may not be aware of their osteoporosis until they suffer a painful fracture. the symptom associated with osteoporotic fractures usually is pain; the location of the pain depends on the location of the fracture. the symptoms of osteoporosis in men are similar to the symptoms of osteoporosis in women. fractures of the spine (vertebra) can cause severe ""band-like"" pain that radiates from the back to the sides of the body. over the years repeated spinal fractures can lead to chronic lower back pain as well as loss of height and/or curving of the spine due to collapse of the vertebrae. the collapse gives individuals a hunched-back appearance of the upper back often called a ""dowager hump"" because it commonly is seen in elderly women. a fracture that occurs during the course of normal activity is called a minimal trauma or stress fracture. for example some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while walking or stepping off a curb. hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. with osteoporosis hip fractures can occur as a result of trivial accidents. hip fractures also may heal slowly or poorly after surgical repair because of poor healing of the bone."	what are osteoporosis symptoms and signs?

i understand your symptoms and your question. it may be peripheral neuropathy. i would like to know your age and whether you have diabetes. if you have any back pain radiating to the legs then it can be a spinal problem. i suppose you do not have back pain. the second possibility is hypothyroidism in which there can be such symptoms. if not checked then you need to check thyroid profile. you should get ssep (somatosensory evoked potential) and ncv (nerve conduction velocity) studies of both lower limbs. we will know the function of the nerves in the lower limb. you can get it done at any electrophysiology laboratory. you should get free t4 and tsh done (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to rule out thyroid problem. i suppose you would have done b12 levels before starting the injections. regarding medicines the dose that you are taking now is not adequate. i would suggest you tablet trigabantin 300 mg (gabapentin) twice a day after food and tablet pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. you may feel little giddiness after these medicines but that will settle in three to four days time. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I have been suffering with tingling and needling sensation in my feet from the last one and a half year.

a lot the symptoms listed in your question do not seem related to inappropriate drug usage. perhaps you can tell your girlfriend about your observations do not accuse her of drug usage. instead describe what you see and offer to help her to see a doctor to be medically assessed. tell her that you care about her health and her happiness. offer to pay for the visit and to go with her for support. most physicians are pretty savvy about detecting drug abuse and will not hesitate to have a frank discussion about the dangers and rehabilitation. on the other hand she may have underling medical problems that can be established by the doctor. if you truly care about the well being of this lady please consider taking the above actions.	think my girlfriend is using drugs. not sure what thiugh. symptoms listed below. my girlfroend has the following symptoms; yellow in the eyes acne in random places/red bumps in areas like wrist face chest shoulders back butt and upper thighs as well as a ton of what she says are ingrown hairs on thighs and armpits constant fatigue lower back pain constantly rubbing eyebrows very slowly with eyes jumbled speech decreased appetite weight loss. swings vaginal discharge dark urine hair loss always horny.

your doctor is right in saying that your son has allergic conjunctivitis. eye allergies called allergic conjunctivitis are a common condition that occurs when the eyes react to something that irritates them called an allergen. the most common allergens are dust and pollens. the eyes produce a substance called histamine to fight off the allergen. as a result the eyelids and conjunctiva (the thin filmy membrane that covers the inside of your eyelids) become red swollen and itchy with tearing and burning. the key to treating eye allergies are avoid or limit contact with the substance causing the problem. avoid rubbing eyes instead do cold compresses. use antiallergic eye drop like olopatadine along with lubricating eye drop. we prescribe mild steroid in pulse dose in case allergy is severe. in longstanding allergy we also prescribe tacrolimus (talimus ointment) with very good results. some doctors also prescribe cyclosporine instead of tacrolimus and that is also effective in longstanding cases. this will help you and i am very sorry to say that there is no medicine to cure allergy. only way is to stay away from all those things that you are allergic to. also this allergy will trouble him every year and usually after puberty it decreases. for further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My 3 year old son has eye allergy for over two months now. When I consulted first, doctor suggested after inspection that it is a kind of seasonal pollen allergy and to give the eye drop Olopatadine along with Cellulose based eye lubricant.

a hernia is an opening or weakness in the muscular structure of the wall of the abdomen. this defect causes a bulging of the abdominal wall. this bulging is usually more noticeable when the abdominal muscles are tightened thereby increasing the pressure in the abdomen. any activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure can worsen a hernia; examples of such activities are lifting coughing or even straining to have a bowel movement. imagine a barrel with a hole in its side and a balloon that is blown up inside the barrel. part of the inflated balloon would bulge out through the hole. the balloon going through the hole is like the tissues of the abdomen bulging through a hernia. serious complications from a hernia can result from the trapping of tissues in the hernia -- a process called incarceration. trapped or incarcerated tissues may have their blood supply cut off leading to damage or death of the tissue. the treatment of an incarceration usually involves surgery.	what is a hernia?

your doctor will probably prescribe several medicines after you have had a transient ischemic attack (tia). medicines to prevent blood clots are typically used because blood clots can cause tias and strokes. the types of medicines that prevent clotting are: antiplatelet medicines. anticoagulant medicines. cholesterol -lowering and blood pressure -lowering medicines are also used to prevent tias and strokes. antiplatelet medicines antiplatelets (such as aspirin aspirin with extended-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel ) keep platelets in the blood from sticking together. aspirin is most often used to prevent tias and strokes. many studies have shown that aspirin helps prevent strokes and reduces the risk of another tia in people who have had their first tia. other antiplatelet medicines (such as clopidogrel) may be used for people who cannot take aspirin or for whom aspirin has not been effective. aggrenox a medicine that combines aspirin with dipyridamole is a safe and effective alternative to aspirin to prevent tia and stroke for some people. 9 anticoagulants anticoagulants prevent the production of certain proteins that are needed for blood to clot. if you have atrial fibrillation you will probably take an anticoagulant (such as warfarin ). anticoagulants are more effective than antiplatelets in preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. 4 both anticoagulants and antiplatelets increase the risk of bleeding. warfarin (such as coumadin ) has the highest risk of bleeding problems but the risk is lower when the dosage is closely monitored. if you take warfarin don't suddenly change your intake of foods that are rich in vitamin k. vitamin k can interfere with the action of anticoagulants making it more likely that your blood will clot. for more information see: anticoagulants: vitamin k and your diet. cholesterol-lowering medicines experts recommend that most people who have had a tia take statins which lower cholesterol. many studies show that statins significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a tia. statins even protect against stroke in people who do not have heart disease or high cholesterol. 5 for more information on these medicines see the topic high cholesterol. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat transient ischemic attack tia?

hi a cholesterol level of below 200 is very desirable so 120 would be good. a low triglyceride level is considered less then 50mg/dl and less then 35mg/dl is considered severely low. a triglyceride blood test is the best way to figure out your level. the blood test is performed after an eight- to 12-hour period of fasting to give the most accurate results. it is important to know certain medications cause abnormal test results. so are you really sure it was 24? your hdl 59 is good so at 69 its even better for you. your ldl levels are good at 32 anything below 100 is good. you said. i am now concerned about my mood - very irritable get angry easy and prone to impulsive anxious behaviour. this sounds very much like adhd i would see your own doctor and do go over this with him/her or perhaps your doctor will pass you on to another doctor who specializes in this form of medicine. do hope this helps you. good luck	total cholesterol 120- triglycerides 24- hdl 69- ldl 32- are these counts seriously low? . i am a man aged 38. i exercise daily and am a regular in endurance sports. abut 8 years ago i had depression and anxiety issues and on going panic attacks. i am now concerned about my mood - very irritable get angry easy and prone to impulsive anxious behaviour. of course i hate this and have no real sense of stability. any ideas what i am looking at here? why are my values so low given that i have a very healthy diet and exercise daily. help.

to diagnose a food allergy your doctor will start with a medical history and a physical exam. your doctor will ask about any family food allergies. he or she will ask detailed questions about your symptoms and how soon they begin after you eat a suspected food. it is important to find out whether you have a food allergy or food intolerance. your doctor may ask you to keep a record of all the foods you eat and any reactions. your doctor may ask you to try an elimination diet an oral food allergy challenge or both. in an elimination diet you do not eat groups of foods that likely cause allergic reactions or specific foods based on your history and other tests. if the symptoms go away when you do not eat the food the food is suspect. if the symptoms come back when you eat the food again it may confirm that the food is causing the allergy. the diet usually lasts for 10 to 14 days. in an oral food allergy challenge you eat increasing amounts of both suspect and nonsuspect foods while being observed. your doctor watches to see if and when a reaction occurs. if you have reactions only to the suspect foods and not to the others the diagnosis can be confirmed. this test usually is the best way to determine whether a food allergy exists. you may also have allergy tests. these include: skin tests. a liquid containing an allergen is put on the top layer of skin and the skin is pricked. if the skin reacts with a raised itchy area (called a wheal) it usually means that you are allergic to that allergen. skin tests are quick simple and relatively safe. but results can be false-positive meaning that even though your skin reacts to the food you are able to eat it without symptoms. if you are extremely allergic skin testing may be dangerous. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a blood sample is taken from a vein and tested for immunoglobulin e (ige) antibodies which are produced in response to particular allergens. food allergy tests that are not helpful or are unproved include: 4 igg4 antibody. provocation/neutralization. cytotoxicity. applied kinesiology. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for food allergies?

the traditional flu shot contains proteins separated from the flu virus. those proteins can't cause illness. but your immune system learns to recognize them and mounts a protective reaction if a real live flu virus tries to infect you. the flumist nasal spray works differently. it contains a live flu virus that has been weakened to the point that it can't cause the flu. that sounds pretty scary but millions of people have safely taken this kind of vaccine. the advantage of the nasal spray is that in children who have never had the flu or a flu vaccine before it seems to elicit a stronger immune response than the flu shot.	what's the difference between the nasal spray and injectable vaccines for flu?

it’s the kind of headline that generates attention: “insomnia triggers men’s death kids’ mental decline. ” that’s what the latest research published in the journal sleep is showing. in one study researchers at penn state college of medicine found: * men with chronic insomnia who got less than six hours of sleep a night were four times more likely to die than those who regularly got more rest. in this 14-year study weight and smoking habits were factored into the difference. in another study this one done in australia a group of researchers looked at the link between sleep and mental illnesses among young people and discovered that: * young adults who habitually slept fewer than five hours a night were three times more likely to develop psychiatric disorders than those that got eight to nine hours of shut-eye. that’s pretty alarming. the australian researchers surveyed about 20 000 people between the ages of 17 years and 24 years over 18 months. i’ve written many times about the importance of sleep for our youth and this further confirms my recommendation. teens need at least eight-and-a-half hours of sleep a night to function best but many aren’t getting that. if you’ve got young adults in your home you’re well aware of the challenges to changing household habits around sleep. it’s long been known that the effects of sleep deprivation are deadly. sleep deprivation raises your risk for a slew of health problems including heart disease diabetes and high blood pressure. that’s the reasoning behind the increased risk of death among men who don’t get enough sleep. you have to wonder though: did their poor sleep habits begin in adolescence? they may not have grown into adults with “psychiatric disorders ” but habits typically start in one’s youth. changing the sleep habits of a young person takes a concerted effort starting with a simple conversation about the value and importance of sleep. this may not go over too well with teenagers who prefer to stay up late but as with everyone else their morning wake-up call doesn’t usually change. so to get more sleep you have to be an enforcer: * change the bedtime routine and get to bed sooner. * set limits on things like electronics television viewing and engaging in stimulating activities. * maintain sound sleep environments. this goes for children their dads and their moms. women don’t get a free pass here. they’ll be the target of another study soon enough. and the headline will read something like “sleep: live longer stay sharper be happier. ”	why is getting enough sleep so important?
your doctor is right. carbamazepine can get secreted in breast milk and it is the safest antiepileptic during lactation. 1 month old baby sleeps a lot. they can sleep for about 18 to 20 hours a day. they will wake up only for feeds. as long as the baby is gaining weight it is fine. also note that keeping your baby on breast milk has many advantages over formula. breast milk has enzymes which help in better digestion. breast milk also contains various antibodies produced in your body which provides immunity to the newborn. it is recommended that you breastfeed your baby for at least up to 6 months of age. for further information consult a lactation counselor online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am a mother of 1 month old baby, who is exclusively breastfed.

i will never understand that rationale of giving antibiotics to anyone that has a viral infection. this is not good medicine. most cases of tonillitis are viral and antibiotics are absolutely worthless and sometimes even harmful. with that said. first i assume you are a healthy adult. most adults have relatively good immune systems that fight off viral (and bacterial) exposures 24/7. while the organisms may be capable of causing disease the organism has to find a susceptible host. most of the time we just fight off those alien bugs. if you don't have tonsils you can't get tonsillitis but you can get a viral infection but it does not mean it will be identical to your son who has a different immune system. you may just get a stuffy nose or nothing at all. in your case you did get an upper respiratory infection but it didn't have to come from your son. it could have been someone else and an entired different bug. there are over 200 respiratory viruses capable of causing colds. i get exposed to strep a dozen times a week and have never got it thanks to my own immune system (and perhaps better handwashing and other precautions). trust your immune system. in most cases you will be just fine. the cold that you most likely have now will likely improve in a few days on its own.	can a person get tonsilitis if they nolonger have tonsils. my son had tonsilitis. tonsilitis is a viral infection and does not require an antibiotic. however tonsilitis can be caused by strep which is bacterial which requires an antibiotic. dr did't do a strep test but perscribed an antibiotic. a few days after he got better i developed an extremely sore throat runny nose caughing headache no fever. tonsilitis symptoms. can i get tonsilitis if i had my tonsils removed? if i have a strep infection will my immune system fight it off.
you bring up two important issues regarding the treatment of adhd with medications. first the difficulty finding the right combination of medications when co-existing conditions are present and second the use of adhd medications during pregnancy. when choosing a medication to address adhd symptoms it is extremely important to keep co-existing conditions in mind and not make them worse with treatment. some co-existing conditions such as mild depression/demoralization or anxiety may be the result of untreated adhd and will improve once the adhd is treated. however some stimulants may make anxiety (or depression) worse particularly those in the amphetamine class so its best to avoid those if you can if you have anxiety. in addition other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) have been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety in persons with adhd. this treatment can be a particularly useful adjunct for those with anxiety/self-esteem issues or who can not take medications for whatever reason. that brings us to the second issue pregnancy and medications used to treat adhd. basically the stimulants are not recommended for use during pregnancy in order to avoid any possibility of damage to the developing fetus. there have been no studies done in humans but cardiac defects have been seen in animals given very high doses of stimulants during pregnancy. if you are contemplating getting pregnant it is best to discuss this with your prescribing physician and ob/gyn and wean off any stimulant treatment.	i'm a 29-year-old female with adhd depression and anxiety and can't find the right medication/treatment plan for me. al. i'm a 29-year-old female with adhd depression and anxiety and can't find the right medication/treatment plan for me. also willl my adhd be affected by my planned ivf?
most helpful answer everything i have read says cold. if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal. heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed. this is to increase circulation and promote healing. more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone-like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body. so if you can move do. lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery. the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re-construct those damaged tissues. this information is from exercise physiology. ice is typically among the first thing to do in the recovery process after strenuous exercise. icing your muscles helps to reduce pain and decrease swelling and inflammation. ice causes your blood vessels to narrow which will reduce your blood flow to the muscle or injured area. never place ice directly on your skin however. wrap an ice pack around a thin cloth and place on the affected muscle for ten minutes at a time. you can use ice multiple times per day for a few days after exercise but make sure to allow for your skin to return to room temperature before icing after each 10 minute interval. heat is typically applied to uscles or injuries that do not have swelling or inflammation. heat will cause your blood vessels to expand which improves circulation and allows more blood to go to the affected area. heat can be useful for chronic injuries and muscle soreness or it can be used before exercise to stimulate blood flow and help prepare the muscle for exercise. heat should also not be directly applied to skin and should be used for short 10-15 minute intervals. always check with your doctor before starting treatment of an injury especially if the condition worsens or fails to improve. within the first few days of an injury ice can help the process of healing. applying ice to injured tissue can cause blood vessels to shrink and this makes them less capable of releasing chemicals that lead to swelling inflammation and pain. after a few days it probably best to apply heat to sore muscles. this makes muscle spasms less likely and relaxes injured muscles. however because the events behind every injury are different speak with your doctor first. i have just spent the last 6 weeks in physical therapy. they always apply heat or have me get on a bike to heat up my muscles for 15 minutes before i go through any table massage work. next i do all my exercises then they end the session with 10 minutes of ice. somtimes what contributes to soreness is 1) lack of warm-up so insuffcicient oxygen was available to fuel the work. and 2) lack of cooldown which will help the muscles recover by completing any partial combustion of sugars for energy leaving residual metabolites such as one feels with the muscle burn of working beyond anerobic threshold. anerobic threshold can be increased through more careful training. i can exercise well beyond my predicted 100% of age heart rate for periods of 10 20 and 30 minutes or more	is it better to apply heat or cold to sore muscles after stenuous exercise?
yes you can not the norm but you still ovulate and if those eggs get caught in the tube and are fertilized then you have a tubal pregnancy which is life threatening also again not the norm but it can happen where a fertilized egg leaves the tube free floating and attaches itself to abdominal organs and starts to grow presenting itself like a tumor. i answer this from having 14 years in high risk labor and delivery and have seen these happen. very rare but it can happen.	can i get pergnant after a partial hysterectomy? . my uterus was removed but my overies and tubes are still in tact. is there a slim chance i could get pregnant?

chickenpox shingles and postherpetic neuralgia all result from infection with a single virus called varicella zoster virus. most people catch the varicella zoster virus as children. after a bout of chickenpox our immune systems never completely eradicate the vzv virus. they just chase it into hiding. varicella retreats into nerve cells deep under the skin near the spine. for most of us vzv lies dormant inside our bodies never causing further problems. in about one-third of people however vzv emerges from hiding travels along a nerve to the skin and erupts in a bumpy painful rash on one side of the body. this sneak attack is called herpes zoster or shingles.	what causes shingles pain?

well unfortunately there are not many options that are available for a pregnant woman when they are having a cold. but by talking to the pharmacist we might be able to actually recommend some products that might actually assist in the symptom relief. we are going to ask the patient though how far along they are in their pregnancy and maybe whether they tried in the past and have they spoken to their ob/gyn or healthcare professional to see if they had actually recommended any specific products for them to use? for things like nasal congestion. simple saline spray or drops will help loosen that up and help them breath a little better. they can also use things like a vaporizer or a humidifier at night while they are sleeping including a medicine cup in that vaporizer with a little vicks vaposteam will actually help decongestant through the night as well. and elevating their head not lying flat down on the bed will assist in that too. a little vicks vaporub is fine to rub on a pregnant woman it's safe and it does work and helps clear the breathing a little bit. but once again that we really need to talk to the patient find out what their symptoms are and make sure that they are being referred back to their doctor or healthcare provider for further treatment if they seem that they are getting worse it could be more signs of infection or something like that.	what can you take for a cold during pregnancy?

whether or not an insurer pay for a procedure depends on whether it's considered medically necessary. if the procedure is needed to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body it's likely to be medically necessary. although breast implants in most cases are not covered by insurance it's possible that a ruptured implant could present a medical issue that insurance would cover. contact your insurance company to find out what your policy is likely to cover. and i would quickly consult with your physician to learn what needs to be done and see if you can get his or her help in justifying the need for insurance coverage to fix it.	i was in a bike accident and i may have ruptured a breat implant. will insurance cover a ruptured breast implant?

under the law there is financial assistance to help make the cost of coverage more affordable. people with very low incomes in states that expanded their medicaid programs may qualify for low or no cost coverage through that program. people with incomes below about $46 000 per year qualify for tax credits to lower the cost of insurance premiums. the lower your income the more help you'll get. in addition if you earn less than roughly $29 000 you may qualify for reduced cost-sharing. that means you'll pay less when you go for medical care. you should log onto healthcare. gov right away. you'll be able to plug in your income information and learn if you qualify for financial assistance. open enrollment closes this sunday february 15th so you need to act now to get health insurance for 2015. once open enrollment closes you won't have a chance to buy insurance for the remainder of the year.	what if i dont qualify for medicade but also have low income

"atopic dermatitis is generally easily diagnosed based on a physical exam and visual inspection of the skin by a physician or dermatologist. additionally the history given by the patient and contributory family history help to support the diagnosis. a doctor may ask about any history of similar rashes and other medical problems including hay fever (allergies) and asthma. while currently there may be no single specific laboratory test that says unequivocally ""this is atopic dermatitis "" a skin biopsy (a sample of a small piece of skin that is sent to the lab for examination under the microscope) may be helpful to establish the diagnosis in harder cases. additionally gentle skin swabs (long cotton tip applicator or q-tip) samples may be sent to the lab to exclude infections of the skin which may mimic atopic dermatitis. since itching tends to be the main common symptom of the disease for many patients it is not possible to say all itching is atopic dermatitis. itching may be seen in many other medical conditions that have nothing to do with eczema. each patient experiences a unique combination of symptoms and the symptoms and severity of the disease may vary over time. the doctor bases the diagnosis on the individual's symptoms and may need to see the patient several times to make an accurate diagnosis. it is important for the doctor to rule out other diseases and conditions that might cause skin irritation. in some cases the family doctor or pediatrician may refer the patient to a dermatologist or allergist (allergy specialist) for further evaluation. a valuable diagnostic tool is a thorough medical history which provides important clues as to the possible causes of the patient's ailment. the doctor may ask about all of the following: a family history of allergic disease whether the patient also has diseases such as hay fever or asthma exposure to irritants sleep disturbances any foods that seem to be related to skin flares previous treatments for skin-related symptoms use of steroids and the effects of symptoms on schoolwork career or social life. sometimes it is necessary to do a biopsy of the skin or patch testing to determine if the skin's immune system overreacts to certain chemicals or preservatives in skin creams. a preliminary diagnosis of atopic dermatitis can be made if the patient has three or more characteristics from each of two categories: major features and minor features. some of these characteristics are listed in the box below. skin scratch/prick tests (which involve scratching or pricking the skin with a needle that contains a small amount of a suspected allergen) and blood tests for airborne allergens generally are not as useful in diagnosing atopic dermatitis as a medical history and careful observation of symptoms. however they may occasionally help the doctor rule out or confirm a specific allergen that might be considered important in the diagnosis. negative results on skin tests are reliable and may help rule out the possibility that certain substances are causing skin inflammation in the patient. however positive skin scratch/prick test results are difficult to interpret in people with atopic dermatitis and are often inaccurate. in some cases where the type of dermatitis is unclear blood tests to check the level of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) or ige (an antibody whose levels are often high in atopic dermatitis) are helpful. major and minor features of atopic dermatitis major features itching characteristic rash in locations typical of the disease (arm folds and behind knees) chronic or repeatedly occurring symptoms personal or family history of atopic disorders (eczema hay fever asthma) some minor features early age of onset dry rough skin high levels of immunoglobulin e (ige) an antibody in the blood ichthyosis hyper linear palms keratosis pilaris hand or foot dermatitis cheilitis (dry or irritated lips) nipple eczema susceptibility to skin infection positive allergy skin tests"	how is atopic dermatitis diagnosed?

this is a tough one because antihistamine use which is typically a product used to treat hives really can't be used in pregnant women. i would ask her how often is she getting the hives and is this related to something along the food allergy so she could avoid certain foods. a lot of people don't realize too when they change detergents they actually can get an allergic reaction and that might cause hives. sometimes pregnant women will figure well i have to go with a different detergent now that i am pregnant. now a lot of times it's that reaction that will cause this. ask if she has been to a doctor dermatologist to see if they are aware of the fact that she is breaking out like this. one of the great products that we have available is an oatmeal bath or aveeno products. that's great to kind of calm down them. but if it seems like it's getting more-and-more common and more severe she needs to go see her doctor to have it checked out even further.	i am pregnant with hives what can i take?

most helpful answer well i hope you understand that taking female hormones alone will never physically change your genitalia to that of a woman. in other words you will still have a penis and scrotum. however female hormones will gradually feminize your appearance and you will grow breasts. as i say this is a gradual process. it doesn't happen overnight. more like weeks to months. if you're transgender (as i'm assuming you are) i hope you're under the care of a trusted medical professional. i've had the privilege of working with many transgender patients and i know that products circulate illicitly within the community. i would urge you not to attempt to use female hormones without medical supervision. you don't necessarily know what you're getting with some of those black market products products purchased from websites and so on. if you are under the care of a medical professional good for you! he or she should be able to help guide you through the complexities of changing genders. i wish you all the best on this journey!	how soon i see if hormon therapy change me from male to female

"a diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be suspected in patients with fatigue cold intolerance constipation and dry flaky skin. a blood test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. when hypothyroidism is present the blood levels of thyroid hormones can be measured directly and are usually decreased. however in early hypothyroidism the level of thyroid hormones (t3 and t4) may be normal. therefore the main tool for the detection of hyperthyroidism is the measurement of tsh the thyroid stimulating hormone. tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland. if a decrease of thyroid hormone occurs the pituitary gland reacts by producing more tsh and the blood tsh level increases in an attempt to encourage thyroid hormone production. this increase in tsh can actually precede the fall in thyroid hormones by months or years. thus the measurement of tsh should be elevated in cases of hypothyroidism. however there is one exception. if the decrease in thyroid hormone is actually due to a defect of the pituitary or hypothalamus then the levels of tsh are abnormally low. this kind of thyroid disease is known as ""secondary"" or ""tertiary"" hypothyroidism. a special test known as the trh test can help distinguish whether the disease is caused by a defect in the pituitary or the hypothalamus. this test requires an injection of the trh hormone and is performed by an endocrinologist (hormone specialist)."	how is hypothyroidism diagnosed?

there are a few reasons for why the uterus measures larger than the dates. the most common reason is you are further in the pregnancy then you think. but since you had an ultrasound exam this is not the case. another reason could be you are carrying more than one child like twins. but if you had an ultrasound exam they should have seen this (although this can be missed). uterine fibroids (benign muscle tumor) of the uterus can make the uterus larger then you think. the other thing it may be is your doctor is wrong. it is just an estimation. i would not be too concerned about it at this time. when you see your doctor ask him about what the ultrasound exam showed. you can also call the office and speak to someone to read you the ultrasound results. uterus larger than the dates:? = wrong date (lmp) =polyhydramnious (excess amount of amniotic fluid in uterus) =larger baby (macrosmia) =multiple pregnancy =molar pregnancy =uterine fibroids =pelvic mass uterus smaller than the dates.? =wrong date (lmp) =oligo hydramnious =smaller baby (microsmia) =head engaged too deeply =genetic (maternal paternal small size) =intrauterine growth restriciton (iugr) =intrauterine death (iud)	what causes a large uterus?

high fever and chill are indicative of infection indeed and as we have a cause rightly evident there are chances that you may be developing hydronephrosis (accumulation of urine in swollen kidney) in the right kidney and a secondary infection following stasis of urine (stoppage or reduced flow of urine) in the kidney leading to nephritis. though urine culture generally picks up infection in the bladder nephritis is more of a clinical diagnosis with pain and tenderness in the renal angle and high grade fever accompanying it. ideally you should be started on prophylactic antibiotics to control the infection sooner before septic features or septicemia may occur. i think you should take a second opinion from another urologist too. for further information consult a urologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am a 41 year old woman, and started having severe lower back pain and nausea about a week ago.  Went to the ER, had a CT scan, diagnosed with a 6.5 mm kidney stone in my right ureter with mild hydronephrosis.  I was given Percocet and sent home with instructions to see a urologist.  I was not able to get an appointment until yesterday.  Two days after my ER visit, I began having severe chills and running fever as high as 101.5.  The urologist did a UA yesterday, and said I did not have an infection. And also he did a KUB, which showed my stone had not moved at all.  He scheduled me for a lithotripsy next Tuesday.  I continue to have severe chills and fever.  I called his office today and he says I probably have flu.  Is it possible that I have an infection in my right kidney? Because the stone is blocking the ureter. But, urine I am passing is clear and uninfected. Please help.

pcips which went into effect last july were set up to extend coverage for the medically uninsurable. the plans -- which cover primary and specialty care hospitalization prescription drugs and preventive care at 100% -- are intended to function as a bridge until 2014 when insurers can no longer deny coverage even to those who are sick. here is what's different about these plans: looser requirements: the requirement that you must demonstrate that you've been denied by insurers before applying has been lifted. that's a big deal and saves both time and money for people interested in applying. lower cost: the federal government runs the pcip program in 23 states and washington d. c. in most of those places the plans will become more affordable. the amount of premium cuts will vary by state with some slashing prices by as much as 40%. you can check the government's web site to see what prices are where you live. state flexibility: there are 27 states that run their own pcip program which have been granted the option by the federal government to reduce premium costs as well. check with your state's health department or pcip (visit pcip. gov or call 866-717-5826). unfortunately what's not different is the requirement that you are uninsured for six months in order to qualify for coverage. for information about how to sign up for a pcip plan visit pcip. gov or call 866-717-5826.	what are pre-existing condition insurance plans (pcip)?

one common cause of acid reflux disease is a stomach abnormality called a hiatal hernia. this occurs when the upper part of the stomach and lower esophageal sphincter (les) move above the diaphragm a muscle that separates your stomach from your chest. normally the diaphragm helps keep acid in our stomach. but if you have a hiatal hernia acid can move up into your esophagus and cause symptoms of acid reflux disease. these are other common risk factors for acid reflux disease: eating large meals or lying down right after a meal. being overweight or obese. eating a heavy meal and lying on your back or bending over at the waist. snacking close to bedtime. eating certain foods such as citrus tomato chocolate mint garlic onions or spicy or fatty foods. drinking certain beverages such as alcohol carbonated drinks coffee or tea. smoking. being pregnant. taking aspirin ibuprofen certain muscle relaxers or blood pressure medications.	what causes acid reflux disease?
the more we know about nutrition and health the more it seems we need to eat the way we did a hundred years ago. recent research is pointing us in the direction of eating mostly whole foods (foods in as close to its natural form as possible). consider the following whole food switches: *whole grains instead of refined grains whenever possible. *fruits vegetables and beans instead of a supplement containing fiber or vitamins. *a skinless chicken breast cooked with healthful ingredients instead of chicken nuggets made from processed chicken with added fats flavorings and preservatives. *a baked potato with chopped green onions and light sour cream instead of sour cream-and-onion potato chips. *fresh berries added to hot or cold whole grain cereal for a naturally sweet breakfast instead of berry-flavored pastries or breakfast bars. *a smoothie made with blueberries yogurt and frozen banana instead of a blueberry slush or flavored drink. eating more whole foods is one of the easiest routes to improving health and preventing disease. vegetables fruits whole grains nuts and seeds and legumes are great examples of foods that offer a powerful combination of important vitamins minerals fiber protein and antioxidants.	how can it eat more whole foods?

this is a very interesting question that makes me wonder if you're from the piedmont area of georgia where chalk eating is not uncommon among african american women. probably the most concerning aspect of chalk eating in terms of pregnancy is the possibility of becoming anemic. anemia is a condition that occurs when your blood lacks enough red blood cells to carry oxygen. being pregnant makes a woman more susceptible to anemia as it is let alone adding in chalk eating to possibly make you even more susceptible. some anemias can be caused by vitamin b deficiencies including folate (folic acid ) which could indeed harm a fetus. i don't know if chalk eating contributes to vitamin b deficiency anemias or not. another side effect of chalk eating is constipation. while this won't affect your chances of conceiving constipation can make pregnancy more uncomfortable than it needs to be. short answer: if you're trying to conceive or are already pregnant give up the chalk eating at least until after your baby arrives. best wishes to you!	can eating chalk harm my baby or stop me from getting pregnant?
if the eel was fumigated maybe that's causing a bit of an issue. honestly your case of the nerves over being forced to eat something is likely to be the main cause of this especially if they are not having diarrhea. or you could have gotten it from some other issue that's happening at the same time. sushi and sashimi have to be prepared under some pretty high standards in most cases i'd trust it more than a regular hamburger.	diarrhea worried about anisakis. yesterday i went to an asian restaurant and my friends basically forced me into eating eel sushi roll i think it was fumigated due to the color and taste but i think it was raw. now this morning i got diarrhea and i'm burping a lot (sorry if i was so explicit but couldn't put that in any other way) and got a little bit of gastric acidity. now i don't think i have nausea i have a weird feel but it's probably because i'm stressing about it and i am a hypochondriac so it could be related to that.

i don't know enough about your particular case (nothing in fact) to know if you are a surgical candidate or not. i think it is a big jump from failure of anti-inflammatory cream to the operating room however. a choice of specialists depends on where the nerve impingment starts. if it is in your back a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon would be the specialist of choice.	what kind of surgery would you have for a pinched nerve in your leg. my doctor told me that if the anti inflammatory cream he has me on does not work i will need surgery. i am just curious what the names are of possible surgeries to fix this problem so that i can research them. the pain is in my left leg. lower outside. doctor said the pinched nerve is near the outside of my knee

influenza ( flu ) usually comes on suddenly. in many cases people can pinpoint the hour when symptoms started. symptoms develop 1 to 4 days after you are infected and they include: fever which lasts for about 3 days. fever is usually slightly lower on the 2nd and 3rd days but may last up to 8 days. cough runny nose and sore throat which become more noticeable as fever and other symptoms decrease. these symptoms usually last 3 to 4 days after the fever goes down. a dry hacking cough may linger for up to 10 days after other symptoms are gone. complete recovery may take 1 to 2 weeks or longer. fatigue and weakness can last for several weeks. complications of influenza may develop in anyone but they are much more likely in older adults and people who have other health problems especially heart and lung diseases. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get influenza?

the amount of sleep that a child needs is going to be based on that child’s age. actually we have a great article on webmd where you can actually click on the different ages to find out what your child’s sleep need is going to be. but generally speaking what we’re finding in national sleep foundation’s polls is that kids aren’t getting enough sleep and they are also not getting sleep at the times that they need. it may be an enjoyable thing to because you’re coming home late to be able to spend some time with your child and have them stay up past their bedtime but it really can be a detriment to their health in the long run. in the first year of life children are going to sleeping north of 18 hours in some cases. maybe as little as 12 or 13 hours but that oftentimes occurs if you have a very colicky baby or a reflux baby. try to know and understand what health issues could be going on there. when you get into the 2 to 3 range that’s when your children should be sleeping about 11 – 12 hours. then when you start to move into grade school you’re going to be looking at 9 to 10 hours and you should your kids should stick to the 9 to 10 hour range almost through high school. very few high schoolers get that much sleep and so interestingly what we’ve found is first of all high school age children tend to swing and want to stay up late and sleep late and so anybody out there who has a high school age kid knows that the kids want to stay up til 2:00 am and then they want to sleep til noon. uh that’s a natural occurrence for them. believe it or not in minnesota they actually changed school start times and they found that kids increased their grades by almost a full letter grade by actually going to school later and staying later. so when you’re talking with your children about sleep one of the things that you want to say is hey this is very important for you. first of all it helps you learn second of all it helps your overall mood and finally it really helps your health. and so i try to make the importance of sleep greater for children so that way they can get an understanding of it. it’s not that mom or dad wants you to go to bed at a certain time because they are mean. it’s because they are actually doing something better for your health.	how much sleep does my child need?

one of the first steps in quitting smoking is to examine the different methods to become smoke free and decide which one would work best for you. some of the options include nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) such as gum or patches; prescription medication like chantix or wellbutrin; or methods like tapering postponing or cold turkey. do research beforehand to weigh the pros and cons of each method before implementing a program. next think about how ready you are to quit smoking on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being not ready to quit whatsoever and 10 being ready to quit right now. pick a number that best represents where you stand at the moment. why didn’t you pick a number that was lower? here it may help to think about the benefits that you stand to gain from quitting smoking or your reasons behind wanting to quit. what would it take for you to be higher on that scale towards a 10 then? at this point it might help to think about what you would need to become fully motivated and put your thoughts about quitting smoking into action. it’s important to develop strategies to help you be successful. what are potential barriers that may get in the way of your success and how do you plan to overcome them? it might be helpful to tell your friends your desire to quit and enlist their support in working towards your goal. no matter what don’t give up! many people have several unsuccessful attempts before they finally are able to become smoke free because quitting smoking can be an incredibly difficult thing to do for some people. the webmd smoking cessation center would be a great resource for more information and for direction on where to get more help regarding becoming smoke free. talk to your doctor for further guidance as well.	how can i stop smoking when already i'm addicted to it.? . i have stopped smoking an year ago but again smoked once due to peer pressure. but i dont want that to continue. how can i proceed. for this.?

don't let her intimidate you into not putting them on her plate. in order for a child to eat a vegetable they must first tolerate the appearance of the vegetable. after a while you may talk her into touching them. smelling them. or even putting them on her tongue. eventually you can work up to getting her to eat a tiny piece. then a whole one. and then finally she may eat a full serving. it can take a while so be patient. don't use threats but you can use rewards if she understands money. give her about $10 worth of quarters and tell her she can spend them on on a toy. if she has any left at the end of the week. if she refuses to eat a green bean she can pay you with a few quarters. as she sees her stash going down she may reconsider and just eat one. in the meantime learn to puree them in her food. hide cooked vegetables in hamburger meat spaghetti or pizza sauce meatloaf etc. use veggie hot dogs. you can even give her gummi veggies. don't give up. you will win this battle eventually.	how do i get my 4 year old to eat vegetables? . she is a picky eater to begin with but i have tried letting her pick out the veggies when we shop and help me prepare them. i have tried steaming blanching saute and raw. i just don't want veggies to be a battle. i'm afraid she will never eat them.

a complex study published in may 2011 involved about 18 000 women and 1330 episodes of contraceptive failure. researchers looked at the data on women both during months of contraceptive success (i. e. not getting pregnant) versus contraceptive failure to see if taking antibiotics made any difference. the bottom line: contraceptive failures did occur but it was no more likely to occur if a woman was taking oral antibiotics. warning: it is well known that one particular antibiotic rifampin does definitely change the metabolism of many oral contraceptives. the study excluded women on that medication because the interaction of rifampin and contraceptives is well established. if you’re taking rifampin you must use a second form of birth control. even the best largest studies can’t say with 100% certainty that a super-rare event can’t occur. it could be that in very rare cases antibiotics could somehow affect the way oral contraceptives work. so if you want to be super-safe using two contraceptives is never a mistake.	do antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives?
hpv infection is caused by a virus. more than 100 types of hpv have been found. some types cause genital warts and some can lead to cervical cancer. types 6 and 11 cause most genital warts. other types such as 16 and 18 are high-risk and can cause abnormal cell changes on the cervix. how the disease is spread (transmission) hpv is spread by direct contact. the virus can be spread to or from the genitals anus mouth or throat during sexual activities. but warts in the mouth or throat are extremely rare. condoms can lower your risk of getting genital warts. you can prevent infection when you use them every time you have sex. after the infection occurs it may spread to other areas of the genitals or to the anal area. you can spread the virus even if you do not have any symptoms of infection or any visible warts. there is a small chance that a pregnant woman can pass the virus to her baby. it is unknown if it is spread during vaginal delivery or if it is spread during the pregnancy. most women with genital warts do not need to have a cesarean delivery. but your doctor might recommend a cesarean delivery if the genital warts would be in the way or bleed a lot during vaginal delivery. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes genital warts human papillomavirus?
psoriatic arthritis frequently involves inflammation of the knees ankles and joints in the feet and hands. usually only a few joints are inflamed at a time. the inflamed joints become painful swollen hot and red. sometimes joint inflammation in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit giving them the appearance of a sausage. joint stiffness is common and is typically worse early in the morning. less commonly psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion mimicking the pattern seen in rheumatoid arthritis. psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the sacrum causing pain and stiffness in the low back buttocks neck and upper back. in about 50% of those with spondylitis the genetic marker hla-b27 can be found. in rare instances psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. a very destructive form of arthritis called mutilans can cause rapid damage to the joints of the hands and feet and loss of their function. fortunately this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis. patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and around cartilage. this inflammation may lead to an enthesopathy which is inflammation of a tendon at the site where it inserts into the bone. inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes achilles tendinitis leading to pain with walking and climbing stairs. inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause chest pain as seen in costochondritis.	what are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?

vaccination is the primary method for control of influenza; however antiviral agents have a role in the prevention and treatment of mainly influenza type a infection. regardless antiviral agents should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for vaccination. as of dec. 15 2010 the cdc published the following concerning antiviral medications: antiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza. influenza antiviral prescription drugs can be used to treat influenza or to prevent influenza. two fda-approved influenza antiviral medications are recommended for use in the united states during the 2010-2011 influenza season: oseltamivir (tamiflu) and zanamivir (relenza). oseltamivir and zanamivir are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza a and b viruses. antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe complicated or progressive illness or who are hospitalized. antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are at higher risk for influenza complications based on their age and/or medical conditions; clinical judgment should be an important component of outpatient treatment decisions. antiviral medications currently recommended include oseltamivir and zanamivir based upon recent viral surveillance and resistance data indicating that >99% of currently circulating influenza virus strains are sensitive to these medications. amantadine (symmetrel) and rimantadine (flumadine) should not be used because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza a viruses. oseltamivir should be used to provide treatment or chemoprophylaxis (prevention of the flu after exposure to the virus) for infants younger than 1 year of age when indicated. antiviral treatment can be considered for any previously healthy non-high-risk symptomatic outpatient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is not in the recommended groups based upon clinical judgment if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. because antiviral resistance patterns may change over time clinicians should monitor local antiviral resistance surveillance data.	do antiviral agents protect people from the flu?

the tonsils may have little holes or crypts in them that can trap food and other debris. sometimes this debris can calcify and create a little stone-like mass called a tonsilliths (tonsil stone). since i have no way of seeing your little white spot first-hand it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to give you an exact answer based solely on your brief description. it is possible to have localized infections so since you are concerned it would be in your best interest to have your tonsils examined by a health care professional. since you are just getting over a cold it is certainly possible that it is evidence of an infection on your tonsil. one concern would be strep throat. however if you have strep your throat is typically quite sore with fever and oftentimes swollen glands in the front of your neck. if you feel fine otherwise strep throat is less likely. however if it doesn't go away after a few days get your doctor to check it out. another possibility is a tonsil stone. however since you had a cold recently the above is more likely. but here's more information about tonsil stones im not a doctor so dont take my word as gold but i get these little white spots on my tonsils too they irritate me like crazy one evening i had enough so i took a flash light and went into the bathroom and took my fingernail and poked at it and it popped out of the tonsil. and it stopped bothering me. i still get them a lot but i just go in there and get it out i think its like the first answer on here like a calcification.	i have a white spot about the size of a large grain of rice in the back of my throat on my tonsil of the left side. its a small white spot but it is very easy to see upon emamination. i have just gotten over a cold that did start with a very sore throat but that was about a a week ago now. there is only a spot on one side of my throat. i'm worried its some kind of infection. i can touch the area with my tonge and it is much warmer on that side of my throat than the other side. it is mildly irrated.
"it's difficult to answer your question due to some key information that's lacking. for example ""laser resurfacing"" can be done any almost any body part. usually after laser resurfacing of the face we advise patients to keep the skin slathered with moisturizer at all times. that's because the laser can cause severe drying of the skin. however for some people all that goop on the face can indeed cause a breakout of pimples. i suggest you consult your provider to find out if what you're experiencing is normal and if so how to treat it. laser resurfacing of the face also can cause a flare-up of cold sores. if this is the type of ""breakout"" you're referring to then you again should consult your provider to see if you can take a prescription medication to treat the cold sores. whenever a person undergoes a procedure like laser resurfacing they should receive clear written instructions that detail post-procedure care. if you don't receive written instructions you definitely need to ask a lot of questions and take notes about how to care for your skin after laser resurfacing what the normal healing process entails and so on. hope this helps!"	is it normal to break out after a laser resurfacing procedure and what should i do

couples should consider seeing a doctor if they have been trying to conceive for a year without success (6 months for women over 35). the beginnings of a fertility evaluation focus on eggs tubes and sperm. with regards to eggs your doctor will want to confirm that you are releasing your egg and determine how many eggs remain. signs that you are releasing an egg are regular predictable menstrual cycles positive ovulation predictor kits shifts in basal body temperature and/or a high progesterone level approximately one week before your period. ovarian reserve the number of eggs remaining in the ovary can be evaluated with blood tests (fsh amh) and ultrasound for antral follicle count. fallopian tubes can be evaluated by a hysterosalpingogram an x-ray test where x-ray dye is injected into the cervix. the x-ray shows the cavity of the uterus and whether the tubes are open. sperm are evaluated with a semen analysis to look for sperm number and motion. if a semen analysis is not normal it will be repeated to rule out normal fluctuations. if it is normal either the first or second time no further evaluation is needed. if it is abnormal twice you will be referred to urology for further evaluation. the next steps in fertility evaluation and treatment will be based on results to the above tests. while these tests can identify some fertility factors mother nature is more complex. occasionally all the tests will be normal despite a continued delay to pregnancy. therefore your doctor will discuss fertility treatment in the context of the evaluation you have completed.	when should we consider a fertility evaluation and what is involved?

most helpful answer let’s start off with your question regarding the relationship between acne and heavy sweating. sweat does not cause acne. especially during the teen years hormone levels can stimulate excessive oil production. along with those hormones circulating throughout the body causing the excess oil the skin is going through a stage of change that predisposes it to clogging. that pore clogging can develop into pustules pimples whiteheads and blackheads. most foods do not cause acne. with that said it is suggested to eat a healthy and balanced diet. some anecdotal accountings recommend either reducing or eliminating chocolate carbonated beverages caffeine products excess sodium and fried foods. despite extensive marketing through info commercial and lofty prices there is no silver bullet product solution to curing acne. here are some recommendations and treatment that can lessen the acne outbreaks: even though acne is not directly caused by dirt keep your face clean and free of excess bacteria can reduce pore clotting. do not be overly aggressive in the face washing. applying too much pressure to the affected areas can actually aggravate the situation. from my own teenage years applying an astringent following face washing was very beneficial. cleaning pads containing salicylic acid can cause improvement and are relatively cost effective. be careful about using cover-up makeup products which can further cause pore clotting. do not be tempted to pop the acne blisters as this may cause spreading and infection. keep your body well hydrated and exercise on a regular basis. sleep for eight hours each night. you can search out acne home remedy treatments. the internet is loaded with various homemade recipes that may help. a paste made up of common everyday products such as baking soda and lemon juice work for some individuals. if improvement does not occur within 2 months of applying the above principles then it is time to consult with a doctor. they may prescribe medications such as retin-a accutane antibiotics and others to treat the acne. stay calm and positive. do not become overly stressed and allow acne to control your life. with extra efforts directed at maintaining optimal physical health you should see positive results in reducing acne.	i am 17 year teen boy. i have been getting acne on my face from last 3 years. what should i do? . well i am getting acne on my face continuously. i tried various products but none of them worked. 3 years i have been through this. i also have problem of more than average sweating. are they interrelated? what should i do to stop acne?

it does not take much force at all to crush the larynx. crushing the human throat takes roughly that same amount of pressure as crushing an empty soda container. this is why a move such as a throat gouge should never be used in a fight. the only time this kind of move should be used is if it is life or death. a hit to the throat can easily kill a person and is not to joked with. i hope this clears your doubts.	hi. my name is roberto writing from italy. i write here because i'd have a question i can't resolve in my hometown. let me introduce me: i'm a karate black belt and i like to study anatomy in order to be as more effective as i can. my question is about windpipe's rings resistance to pressure and/or strikes. in short i'd like to know how much it takes to crush/to flat trachea's cartilages with a sharp strike to the cervical part of the throat. thankyou for your attention and patience.

"most helpful answer i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds very painful. just to be clear all pain is ""nerve pain. "" nerves transmit sensation from the body to the brain. that may be why your physician prescribed neurontin ( gabapentin ) for your pain. i'm just guessing here but perhaps the muscle injury is no longer the source of your pain. maybe the pain is now caused by nerves that have become irritated. sometimes a medication like gabapentin can calm down nerves so they stop transmitting pain signals to the brain. at any rate the fact you have no relief from the gabapentin means you need to be re-evaluated by a medical professional. it's true that people sometimes have to learn to live with a certain amount of pain. for example on the ""zero to 10"" scale some people need to learn how to live at a constant pain level of 3 or 4. but it sounds like your pain is more severe than this. for that reason you need to continue to follow up with your doctor. all patients are entitled to pain control though as i said sometimes that means pain of 3 or 4 not pain of zero. wishing you well!"	why am i given neurontin for a stretched muscle is it not for nerve pain only? . my dr told me this muscle will never heal in my shoulder blade so i must continue to do exercises to stop muscle from further damage. i do not have nerve pain so is there any other meds i can take. i was taking percocet for over a year every 4 to 6mnts. dr says now i have to learn to live with this pain and go to pain management classes. neurontin is not helping when the pain becomes severe i go to hospital or leave work when pain becomes umbearable. please help.

i have to say that being overweight is definitely a factor but there are soooo many reasons for shortness of breath in children that it would be wrong to just attribute it to his weight. his doctor needs to do some pulmonary function tests or refer him to someone who can do this. shortness of breath due to exercise can be cardiac (heart) as well as an example. he may need more than just a rescue inhaler like albuterol to manage this problem but you would be wise to take his medical evaluation up a notch. i do agree with what rod moser has said but i do like to add few more things to this that inhalers are just not the available solution for every problem. keeping in consideration the age of your child i will suggest him some deep breath exercise like :- the stimulating breath (also called the bellows breath) the 4-7-8 (or relaxing breath) exercise breath counting. once he will be fine with these he push himself further more with some more deep breath exercise. for more information you can visit pharmacysell	could my child's shortness of breath be related to him being over weight somewhat? . my child is 9 years old and somewhat overweight. he has shortness of breath all the time not just during activity. he goes around taking in deep breaths a lot and i can tell he isn't getting proper air. he uses his inhaler daily. my husband thinks its because he is overweight but i am concerned. he was put on inhaler because he may have exercised induced asthma the doctor said but that was when he was 7 years old. could this type of shortness of breath be caused by overweight? .
during pregnancy it's important for a woman to get enough calcium for herself as well as her growing baby. most studies show that while some bone loss may occur during pregnancy a woman usually regains it after giving birth. in fact studies show that having children even as many as 10 does not increase a woman's chance of getting osteoporosis later in life. for women who have pregnancies in their teens the effects on bone health later in life are still not certain. teens have not yet reached peak bone mass. more studies are needed to learn if teen pregnancies can affect future bone health. some women develop a temporary type of osteoporosis during pregnancy. while we do not fully understand what causes this type of osteoporosis it is extremely rare and usually goes away shortly after a woman gives birth. breastfeeding for the recommended 6-12 months has many health benefits for mother and baby. like pregnancy breastfeeding may cause some temporary bone loss. however bone density appears to recover over time and should not cause long-term harm to a woman's bone health.	what happens to your bones during pregnancy and breastfeeding?

catastrophic plans are plans under which an individual pays the vast majority of out-of-pocket expenses until he/she reaches the plan's deductible. some pros of catastrophic coverage are: catastrophic plans offer more affordable monthly premiums for an individual who might otherwise not purchase insurance coverage at all coverage under such a plan as suggested by its name will at least protect them in the event of a catastrophic event such as a car accident or serious illness that could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills which would plunge many people into bankruptcy the major con of catastrophic coverage is that it covers very few out-of-pocket expenses before the deductible is met and the deductibles under these plans can be quite high. so these plans may not be ideal for individuals who have substantial out-of-pocket expenses. this would include those who take a significant number of prescription drugs on a regular basis and/or find themselves visiting a physician frequently.	what are some of the pros and cons of buying a catastrophic plan?

the income used to figure out if you are eligible for a subsidy is your modified adjusted gross income (magi). that means your household income after deductions and other credits. for most people magi will be the same as adjusted gross income or agi. you can find your agi on line 4 if you file taxes on a 1040 ez form line 22 on form 1040a and line 38 on form 1040.	there are two different definitions of wages. the federal and state of florida. . unemployment insurance in florida counts dividends and wages as wages. this is unlike the federal government that splits the two. so what is our wages when determining your subsidy for health insurance?

it does sound to me that you very well may be suffering from hypothyroidism or at least a sluggish thyroid but it cannot be known for sure without more test results. what tests did your doctor run exactly? if he suspects it may by a thyroid issue he definitely should have ran a tsh free t3 and free t4 test at very least as well as some other tests that may will greatly improve the chances of diagnosing this correctly. without them it is hard to say because hypothyroidism can have overlapping symptoms with other disorders many of which can also be discovered through a comprehensive hormone test. i strongly recommend you getting one done if your doctor has not already.	hypothyroidism. i just had my blood works done and my doctor saw that my calcium levels are slightly above my normal range. my potassium has been low for quite some time now as well. for the past 5 to 6 years i have been feeling tired intermittently. i don't sleep well and when i wake up (even with 8 hours of sleep) i don't feel rested. also i've noticed that i've been having low-grade fever. i seem to be more sensitive to cold weather. i noticed also that i can feel some hot areas on my skin.

the bottom line is that aspirin is sometimes but only rarely and judicially prescribed during pregnancy. unless your doctor prescribes it you should avoid taking aspirin altogether. it is a challenge to keep up with the ever changing rules of which foods beverages and medications (including low dose aspirin) can be safely taken by pregnant woman. the use of aspirin during pregnancy is controversial and generally discouraged unless health conditions in the mother exist so that the benefits of using a low dose aspirin regimen outweigh possible risks. the risks may include: possible lengthening of both the pregnancy and labor which may lead to complications during birth aspirin interferes with a person’s blood's clotting ability. taking aspirin during pregnancy (especially after 32 weeks) can contribute to both mother and fetus bleeding. aspirin can also cause the premature closure of a baby's heart vessels which can lead to high blood pressure in the baby's lungs. increased risk of miscarriage aspirin can interact with other medications and might be dangerous for pregnant women with specific medical conditions. the benefits may include: some research has shown that certain women at high risk for preeclampsia women with chronic hypertension severe diabetes or kidney disease or women who had severe preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy may benefit from low-dose aspirin therapy. in conclusion the benefits of a pregnant taking aspirin are specific only to certain patients with specific medical needs. all medications including over-the-counter lose dose aspirin should not be taken by a pregnant woman without their doctor’s approval.	i am 23 weeks pregnant and i am taking low dose aspirin and labetaloltablet everday. is it advisable
yes it would be appropriate for you to see a medical provider so that you can have your throat properly examined. a sore throat primarily in the mornings wiht improvement in the afternoon may be due to post-nasal drainage at night accompanied by mouth-breathing. allergies can cause this but so can back to back viral infections. mononucleosis is a virus that can cause a sore throat. people also worry about a lingering strep infection so this can be tested for during your examination if your medical provider feels it is necessary. as you have read there are many possibilities to consider so you are wise to seek medical care at this point. i'd say so. it may be something minor like dryness due to furnace season being upon us or post-nasal drip but since the symptoms are bugging you and aren't responding to over-the-counter (otc) remedies you won't lose anything by seeing the doctor. it could be you have a sinus infection or something else that's treatable. and then you won't be uncomfortable anymore. best wishes to you!	have persistant mild-moderate sore throat been nearly two weeks. otc aids little relief. time to see doc?

since this was your first anxiety attack i'm wondering if there are some stressor in your life currently that might be causing this. often we don't realize that we are under stress until our body tells us by doing something like this. i know it's quite upsetting can be frightening but you shouldn't be embarrassed. you have done nothing for which you need to be embarrassed. it's your body responding to something either internal or external. i see that your prescriber has done the prudent thing and has given you something to use as needed. this is always a good idea but you need to do a bit of work on your own too. as i said please review your current situation and see if there is anything that might be causing you some stress or where you have neglected yourself in terms of diet sleep or social activities. all of these are vital to maintain our physical and mental health. i would also suggest that you begin engaging in some self-help techniques such as relaxation breathing mild exercise and positive self talk.	i recently had an anxiety attack. the doctor prescribed medicine to use when i feel one coming. when will they go away?

baby : your baby measures about 10 inches from crown to rump or a total length of about 15. 75 inches from head to toe and weighs about 2. 4 pounds. brain waves show rapid eye movement (rem) sleep which means your baby may be dreaming. eyelids are opening. branches of lungs are developing so there's a good chance that baby would survive if born prematurely now. mom-to-be : your uterus extends well above your navel. as baby gets bigger and stronger this month you may be experiencing leg cramps and mild swelling of ankles and feet difficulty sleeping shortness of breath lower abdominal achiness clumsiness or scattered braxton hicks contractions (hardening and relaxing of the uterus like rehearsals for labor). you may also be urinating more frequently again as the uterus continues to push on your bladder. tip of the week : even if your partner is planning on being with you in the delivery room you might want to consider hiring a doula -- a professional labor assistant who provides support but not medical aid for the mother and her partner. studies show that doulas can shorten a woman's labor and reduce the likelihood of needing pain medication forceps deliveries or a caesarean section.	what can i expect during week 28 of my pregnancy?
no i don't think that your pregnant. i say this because of all the negative test feedback. however i do think that you should see a doctor if you are having such heavy discharge. you could have a number of things going on such as a yeast infection ( which you could try over the counter testing for to determ if that's possibly what it is. they also sell treatment for yeast infections as well. ) you could also have some type of std ( i know that's not what you want to hear. ) i know its not a 100% answer but better to be safe than sorry. if you don't have insurance you can try the free clinic most county's have them. depending on your income you only have to pay a minimum fee or in most cases nothing at all.	if you miss your period how long after will it show positive on test if you r pregnant? how long should u wait to take1. i had a 3day period last month plus it was late. this month i haven't had 1 at all! i am supposed to start my period the 2nd week of the month and i took a pregnancy test and it says negative. i just wanted some advice if i am taking the test to early or if it could be something else because i have had this problem once before but never have had a period only last 3days. i am bloated like and have a lot of discharge. i have took over 8 test within the last month. any advice or help please?
late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to develop and are usually permanent. but keep in mind that the possibility of a late side effect does not mean you will have one. late side effects result from damage done to your body that can cause problems later. for example scar tissue resulting from radiation can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. bladder bowel and sexual problems can develop after radiation to the abdomen/pelvis area. another possible late side effect is the development of a second cancer. radiation has long been recognized as a cancer-causing agent. and research has shown that although rare some people develop another cancer years after radiation therapy has cured the first cancer. it's important to talk with your doctor about the potential risk and to weigh it against the benefits to be derived from radiation therapy as a treatment option.	what are the late side effects from radiation therapy?
with the conversation i understand that you are a 33 year old male suffering from cough especially during the months of september and october through the years. therefore it is clear that you are suffering from allergic bronchitis. it is considered to be seasonal. this cough exacerbates in specific months like september and october in your case. during such exacerbation it is advisable to take a steroid bronchodilator and an antibiotic. in your case decadron (dexamethasone) is the steroid proair hfa aerosol (albuterol) is the bronchodilator and zithromax z-pak (azithromycin) is the antibiotic. accordingly antibiotic should be prescribed only if infection is present and if there is yellow or green colored sputum production fever and chest congestion. bronchodilator in the form of aerosol spray helps to relieve bronchospasm and to get rid of any inflammation associated with it. i would suggest you to continue with the aerosol spray as prescribed by your doctor. check for few days. if the symptoms of cough recur then start the antibiotics. when the allergic bronchitis exacerbates you can use proair inhaler and seroflo inhaler (combination of fluticasone and salmeterol) or budecort (budesonide) inhaler together. the two inhalers have a specific way of usage. you can check it with your physician. for further information consult an allergy specialist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,For the past three years, I have been suffering from allergic cough.

this is a not-uncommon situation. the answer depends a bit on how the wound was packed. for instance if you have sterile water and gauze you can wash your hands put on medical gloves dip the gauze in the sterile water and then gently re-pack the wound yourself. cover with a dry dressing. or if you're not able to do that (or not comfortable doing it) you can simply leave the packing out cover the wound with a clean dressing and call your physician's office when it opens for further instructions. leaving the wound unpacked for 24 hours or so isn't likely to cause a problem with healing. wishing you well!	what do i if the packing falls out of my absess
you can become allergic to the ink at any time or any medicine that you are taking also. you can become allergic to it even though you have been on it for a very long time. so if you are having a reaction one thing is that it could be an allergic reaction but it could also just be something that is occurring in the area of the tattoo that has something to do with the tattoo but because there is pigment there you can't really see the skin clearly. so i would say that this is one time that even though you don't have insurance it is worth seeing a dermatologist to have the area evaluated to make sure that the skin is otherwise healthy. oftentimes with a simple cream they can knock out that allergic reaction if that's what it is or the hypersensitivity reaction another way of calling it or do a biopsy to see if there is anything else going on in that area that might be more serious that might need to be treated. it's also important to remember that itching is part of a tattoo's healing process. intense itching like want to scratch your arm off itching. when the old skin dies and flakes off the new skin growth itches like crazy for a few days before settling down. cool showers and your tattoo aftercare ointment gently massaged into the tattoo will help but all in all the itching will pass after the tattoo is healed. allergic reaction to the ink will look more like red speckles or spots all around your tattoo unusual oozing puss or smelly discharge. you will know within hours of receiving your tattoo if you are allergic to the ink. most tattoo pigments are completely organic and allergic reactions are rare - and most often to red ink. never put a first aid product or anti-itch lotion onto an unhealed tattoo you will first off be in a ton of pain and subsequently ruin your tattoo. - a tattoo artist.	the skin around my tattoo really itches. am i allergic to the ink? should i see a doctor? i don't have health insurance.
in my opinion you should go check for infection and get urine culture asap as vomiting and pain in the catheterization site could be a sign of infection that needs swift treatment. it is normal to place a catheter for a long time if the void test results are negative but it is also a possibility to get an infection at this time. speedy recovery wishes to your mom.

i don't know my chip-loving friend. i guess you just like them. we tend to choose what we eat and you are choosing this odd high-salt high carbo combination (a little protein in the cheese) instead of a normal balanced diet. what? no vegetables? at least you should add some lettuce olives salsa and vegetarian refried beans to the combo. make it a super-nacho! if you fear that this is an odd craving due to an underlying medical condition i can't think of one but i would advise you to eat a bit more sensible than that.	why do i want to eat tostito chip scoops and mozzarello cheese melted all the time?
worms don't cause ringworm. instead this skin infection also known as tinea is caused by fungi called dermatophytes. fungi are microscopic organisms that can live off the dead tissues of your skin hair and nails much like a mushroom can grow on the bark of a tree. ringworm is characterized by a red ring of small blisters or a red ring of scaly skin that grows outward as the infection spreads.	does ringworm mean i have worms?
it is impossible to know how long his medication should be lasting. typically ritalin tablets last about 4 hours ritalin sr tablets last about 6 hours ritalin la capsules last about 8 hours focalin xr capsules last about 10 hours and concerta caplets last about 12 hours. of course these are just averages and there is considerable variability among children. if you think the medication has worn off you can ask your doctor about either changing the morning medicine to something that would last longer or you could ask about adding a short-acting pill in the afternoon on an as-needed basis.

in most cases insurers that are doing this are offering people already insured with them the chance to sign up again for another year generally at a lower price. you can keep a non-aca compliant plan through 2014. but that option goes away in 2014 -- and it's not an option for consumers living in some states because the marketplaces have not allowed it. if you've been given the chance to buy or renew a non-aca plan for another year then i'm guessing you already know the difference in price -- likely the companies are offering a less expensive option with a plan non-compliant with the law. the plans also typically offer benefits that are not as rich. however this option for most people goes away.	i've heard aetna cigna et al. are still underwriting plans until dec. 31 2013. is this true?

this is an excellent question! i can understand why this distinction could be confusing to some people because both stroke and a subdural hematoma involve bleeding inside the skull. however the two conditions are very different. in the simplest terms stroke involves bleeding inside the brain; a subdural hematoma involves bleeding outside the brain. when a stroke occurs a blood vessel within the brain tissue either ruptures or becomes blocked. this in turn deprives an area of brain tissue from receiving the oxygen-rich blood it needs to survive. stroke can occur without warning and often includes one or more of these symptoms : one-sided body weakness numbness or loss of function slurred speech trouble finding the right words sudden vision changes sudden balance changes severe headache a subdural hematoma on the other hand occurs in the tissues that surround the brain. many people don't realize the brain is wrapped in several layers of tissue for protection. first comes the scalp; then the bone tissue of the skull; then a tough fibrous layer of tissue called the 'dura mater;' then a webby layer called 'arachnoid' tissue; and lastly a delicate tissue-paper like layer called the 'pia mater. ' the brain itself lies below all of these layers of tissue. a subdural hematoma is a blood clot that forms due to a bleed that occurs below the dura mater and above the arachnoid tissue. a bleed can occur here due to trauma such as a concussion or other head injury. a subdural hematoma can cause pressure inside the skull to rise compressing delicate brain tissue and causing cells to die. it is a medical emergency that requires a procedure called a craniotomy to remove the blood clot and relieve swelling and pressure inside the skull. keep in mind i have greatly simplified the anatomy in this description. but i hope it helps you better understand how a stroke is different from a subdural hematoma!	what is the difference between a stroke and a subdural hematoma?

the basic cause of heartburn is an underactive lower esophageal sphincter or les that doesn't tighten as it should. two excesses often contribute to this problem: too much food in the stomach (overeating) or too much pressure on the stomach (frequently from obesity or pregnancy). certain foods commonly relax the les including tomatoes citrus fruits garlic onions chocolate coffee alcohol caffeinated products and peppermint. dishes high in fats and oils (animal or vegetable) often lead to heartburn as do certain medications. stress increases acid production and can cause heartburn. and smoking which relaxes the les and stimulates stomach acid is a major contributor.	what causes heartburn?

it sounds like you need something to tone down your cough reflex. start with hot tea with honey but if that doesn't help something to thin your mucus secretions and lessen your cough reflex would help. simple tussin dm or it's generic that is something that includes dextromethorphan and guaiefenesin could help you. if that doesn't do anything either talk to the doctor. you might need a stronger cough syrup than you can get over the counter.	i have an exceptionally violent cough. whenever i have a cold or the flu or bronchitis or anything that causes a cough my cough is very very violent. sometimes it will induce my gag reflex and cause me to vomit. after a day or so it usually feels like i have been in a boxing match my chest and ribs are so sore. coughing so long and violently i can't get air sometimes. any possible answer on how to alleviate this would be appreciated.

obviously i can't specifically answer that question since i do not know anything about your daughter's medical history. not even her current age. my advice is to work closely with an ent specialist to solve this issue. he may need to sample the fluid in her middle ear to culture it (called a tympanocentesis) or she may need the benefits of having tubes placed in her eardrums. mrsa can make it into the middle ear but this would be uncommon. all of these diagnostic and treatment efforts should reduce the frequency of her ear infections and preserve her precious hearing.	how come my daughter's ear infection wont go away when she was a premie she has mrsa could it be back
that's a good question. you'd think a stye would have cleared up by now. first off i would suggest seeing one doctor repeatedly instead of going from doctor to doctor. seeing the same doctor for a given condition offers continuity of care. perhaps you've been going to urgent care facilities where you don't get a choice of which doctor you see. if possible get set up with a primary care provider and get started on solving the stye problem. it's impossible to tell what's going on without performing a physical exam so the only advice i can give you is to go back to the doctor -- preferably the last one you saw for the condition. it's possible you've developed a second eye condition that has nothing to do with the stye. sometimes coincidences happen. wishing you well!	what if is it still draining after 4 months and 3 different scripts from 3 diff doctors? . i had a stye that ruptured 4 months ago. it is still draining enough so that my eye is matted up upon waking and i wipe my eyes constantly. what do i need to do to clear this up? i have seen 3 docs that have prescribed something different each time nothing has worked.
infertility can be treated with medicine surgery artificial insemination or assisted reproductive technology. many times these treatments are combined. in most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery. doctors recommend specific treatments for infertility based on: test results how long the couple has been trying to get pregnant the age of both the man and woman the overall health of the partners preference of the partners doctors often treat infertility in men in the following ways: sexual problems: doctors can help men deal with impotence or premature ejaculation. behavioral therapy and/or medicines can be used in these cases. too few sperm: sometimes surgery can correct the cause of the problem. in other cases doctors surgically remove sperm directly from the male reproductive tract. antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count. sperm movement: sometimes semen has no sperm because of a block in the man's system. in some cases surgery can correct the problem. in women some physical problems can also be corrected with surgery. a number of fertility medicines are used to treat women with ovulation problems. it is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. you should understand the possible dangers benefits and side effects.	how do doctors treat infertility?

it seems that you are suffering from a bipolar affective disorder and currently in the depression phase. according to me your thyroid disturbances should have been treated while taking lithium rather than discontinuing it as lithium is the best medicine for your condition. loss of appetite is due to magnesium valproate tablets as it causes liver dysfunction. i suggest you get a liver function test done. i would advise you try increasing magnesium valproate to minimum 500 mg twice daily and also increase amisulpride in low dose. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and increase the dosage with their consent. before starting bupropion you should have tried minimum effective doses of current medication. i would like to see your recent thyroid profile for better understanding. revert with more information to a psychiatrist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am a 34 year old male weighing 81 kg. I had my first manic episode 16 years back, for which I was put under psychiatric care for two months. Then again after a couple of years, I had some depressive symptoms for which I was prescribed Escitalopram 20 mg once daily and some ayurvedic herbs for two years. After that again six years ago, I had a second manic episode for which I was hospitalized for two months and diagnosed with a schizophrenic disorder, and was given Lithium carbonate 500 mg twice daily and Amisulpride 50 mg before bedtime. Due to some thyroid elevation problem, Magnesium valproate 200 mg twice daily was prescribed instead of Lithium carbonate. But from the past three months, I am experiencing loss of appetite, lethargy, weight loss, abdominal cramp, and acidity.My psychiatrist put me on Bupropion 150 mg once daily, which caused tremors and sweating. So he changed it into Clonazepam, which is causing acute indigestion. Please suggest some medicines as am losing a lot of weight and feeling lethargic.

a hernia repair requires surgery. there are several different procedures that can be used for fixing any specific type of hernia. in the open surgical approach following appropriate anesthesia and sterilization of the surgical site an incision is made over the area of the hernia and carried down carefully through the sequential tissue layers. the goal is to separate away all the normal tissue and define the margins of the hole or weakness. once this has been achieved the hole is then closed usually by some combination of suture and a plastic mesh. when a repair is done by suture alone the edges of the defect are pulled together much like sewing a hole together in a piece of cloth. one of the possible complications of this approach is that it can put excessive strain on the surrounding tissues through which the sutures are passed. over time with normal bodily exertion this strain can lead to the tearing of these stressed tissues and the formation of another hernia. the frequency of such recurrent hernias especially in the groin region has led to the development of many different methods of suturing the deep tissue layers in an attempt to provide better results. in order to provide a secure repair and avoid the stress on the adjacent tissue caused by pulling the hole closed an alternative technique was developed which bridges the hole or weakness with a piece of plastic-like mesh or screen material. the mesh is a permanent material and when sewn to the margins of the defect it allows the body's normal healing process to incorporate it into the local structures. hernia repair with mesh has proved to be a very effective means of repair. after the hernia repair is completed the overlying tissues and skin are surgically closed usually with absorbable sutures. more and more of hernia repairs are now being done using laparoscopic techniques (see below).	how is a hernia repaired?
i hope that by now your extraction site has healed. if you still have the problem you must go and have the site looked at. exposed bone is not normal. it is an indication of problems. it might be due to systemic medication you are taking or have taken in the past. it might be due to the procedure. in any case it has to be examined. please go and see your oral surgeon or go to another one for a proper second opinion. don't leave this be.	my wisdom tooth was removed in an extraction. later a sore opened up and my jawbone is visible. what should i do?

most helpful answer the chance of getting pregnant during your menses is slim. the chance of you getting an sexually-transmitted disease from having unprotected sex with two different guys is high. did you miss that class when you were in high school? you are considered a high-risk patient so it would be in you best interest to be tested for the plethora of stds out there. in the event that you did not contract one you need to bless your lucky stars. sex is fun. sex is natural but it is not worth dying over. did you all go together and get tested and did you see their results? no? then how do you really know that they don't have anything? if you are going to have multiple sex partners you really should use protection (you should use protection even if its one partner and you don't want to get pregnant. ) just go get tested and use protection next time. i wante to know what type of std' test would have to be done? i know that there clean and so am i. but with that i can still get an std?	having sex with two different guys a day apart and on my menstrual. i do know that the two guys are clean and so am i but iam worried since i didnt use protection and since ive heard that you can get so many diseases when you have your menstrual and you have sex. if i can please get some answers iam really worried. if i can end up getting a diease or even having the ability of getting pregnant.
treatment for balanitis depends on the underlying cause. if there is an infection treatment will include an appropriate antibiotic or antifungal medication. in cases of severe or persistent inflammation a circumcision may be recommended. taking appropriate hygiene measures can help prevent future bouts of balanitis such as retracting the foreskin daily and adequately cleaning and drying the head of the penis. in addition it is important to avoid strong soaps or chemicals especially those known to cause a skin reaction.	how is balanitis treated?

"soiling the pants at age four is not consider ""normal"" so you need to discuss this issue with his pediatrician. he could be ""stool-holding"" -- a common problem with busy children who don't really want to take the time out of their busy day to have a bowel movement. they would rather suppress the urge but as you know ""poop happens"" after a period of time when he can no longer hold it. over time his distal rectum can become quite dilated so he may need some help in the way of stool softeners and watching him like a hawk to make sure he isn't doing the ""hide and poop"" game."	is it normal for a 4 year old boy to still be soiling his pants? he is fine with peeing during the day and overnight.

this very important medical exam component is usually performed standing with the medical provider sitting on a stool. the underwear can be pulled down if the patient is not completely disrobed and wearing a gown. the provider should be wearing gloves. the exam in painless only takes a few minutes checking for inguinal hernias or scrotal or testicular masses. there should be an educational component about self-examination for testicular masses and of course ample time should be provider to address any private questions that the young man may have at the time. the exam is done in private and if possible a same-sex clinician can be requested if the young man is shy.	how are young men's genital exams performed - with the patient standing or supine? underwear on or off? wearing gloves?

heart failure is the result of poor cardiac function and is reflected by a decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart called cardiac output. heart failure can be caused by weakness of the heart muscle which pumps blood out through the arteries to the entire body or by dysfunction of the heart valves which regulate the flow of blood between the chambers of the heart. the diminished volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) is responsible for a decreased flow of blood to the kidneys. as a result the kidneys sense that there is a reduction of the blood volume in the body. to counter the seeming loss of fluid the kidneys retain salt and water. in this instance the kidneys are fooled into thinking that the body needs to retain more fluid volume when in fact the body already is holding too much fluid. this fluid increase ultimately results in the buildup of fluid within the lungs which causes shortness of breath. because of the decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) the volume of blood in the arteries is also decreased despite the actual increase in the body's total fluid volume. an associated increase in the amount of fluid in the blood vessels of the lungs causes shortness of breath because the excess fluid from the lungs' blood vessels leaks into the airspaces (alveoli) and interstitium in the lungs. this accumulation of fluid in the lung is called pulmonary edema. at the same time accumulation of fluid in the legs causes pitting edema. this edema occurs because the build-up of blood in the veins of the legs causes leakage of fluid from the legs' capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the interstitial spaces. an understanding of how the heart and lungs interact will help you to better comprehend how fluid retention works in heart failure. the heart has four chambers; an auricle and a ventricle on the left side of the heart and an auricle and ventricle on the right. the left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and transfers it to the left ventricle which then pumps it through the arteries to the entire body. the blood then is transported back to the heart by veins into the right auricle and transferred to the right ventricle which then pumps it to the lungs for re-oxygenation. left-sided heart failure which is due primarily to a weak left ventricle usually is caused by coronary artery disease hypertension or disease of the heart valves. typically when these patients initially come to the doctor they are troubled by shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down at night (orthopnea). these symptoms are due to pulmonary edema that is caused by pooling of the blood in the vessels of the lungs. in contrast right-sided heart failure which often is due to chronic lung diseases such as emphysema initially causes salt retention and edema. persistent salt retention in these patients however may lead to an expanded blood volume in the blood vessels thereby causing fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary congestion) and shortness of breath. in patients with heart failure due to weak heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) both the right and left ventricles of the heart are usually affected. these patients therefore can initially suffer from swelling both in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and in the legs and feet (peripheral edema). the physician examining a patient who has congestive heart failure with fluid retention looks for certain signs. these include: pitting edema of the legs and feet rales in the lungs (moist crackle sounds from the excess fluid that can be heard with a stethoscope) a gallop rhythm (three heart sounds instead of the normal two due to muscle weakness) and distended neck veins. the distended neck veins reflect the accumulation of blood in the veins that are returning blood to the heart.	why does a patient with heart disease retain fluid?

there are many unusual suggestions out there that claims to enhance chances for you to have the sex of your choice but in the end it is basically a coin toss. you will either have a girl or boy (or both) and there is very little that can be done to guarantee the results. some people claim certain sexual positions diet timing of your cycle etc. will make a difference. you are free to try them knowing that it is still a 50/50 chance. statistically the more babies you have the greater the chance of getting one of them to be a boy. i have a friend who has tried multiple times to have a daughter. her last attempt resulted in triplet boys! roll the dice again and see if you get a boy.	i havet 2 daughters now i want male baby plz tell me what can i do?

the only sure-fire way to avoid getting genital herpes is to abstain from sex or have sex only with someone who is also herpes-free. short of that a latex condom offers some protection if it covers the infected area. remember you can get genital herpes by receiving oral sex (fellatio cunnilingus analingus) from someone with a cold sore on the mouth. likewise you can get oral herpes from someone's genitals by way of oral sex. keep in mind that your partner can be contagious even without visible sores. if you know that a sex partner has genital herpes you can reduce your risk by having sex (vaginal anal or oral intercourse) only when he or she has no symptoms. nevertheless genital herpes can be contagious even when there are no visible symptoms so you should always use a latex barrier such as a condom or a dental dam.	if i don't have genital herpes now how can i avoid it in the future?
exercise has no effect on hiatal hernias. exercise however can increase acid reflux in people who are prone to acid reflux presumably those individuals with weak lower esophageal sphincter muscles. exercise increases intra-abdominal pressure and can force stomach acid back into the esophagus through a weak lower esophageal sphincter. the effects of alcohol and tobacco on the effectiveness of protonix or related drugs (proton pump inhibitors or ppis) are minimal. however both alcohol and tobacco aggravate the underlying acid-related conditions for which protonix is used and they should be discouraged.	can exercise help with a hiatal hernia and do alcohol or tobacco have any effect on (pantoprazole) protonix?
there are physicians certified in addiction medicine at county and state facilities who are able to offer assistance at very reasonable rates for residents. you can check on this via the american society of addiction medicine: www. asam. org. in addition you can also research where 12 step meetings are held and attend or call the listed number to ask for help. if you find out that you will be responsible for paying the cost of drug detox treatment and/or rehab do not let that discourage you from getting help. talk to the detox facility and/or rehab to see if they offer any discounts or scholarships. it could be you qualify for a special program. another option for covering the cost is to see if the detox center (rehab) works with a finance company or can recommend a finance company that other patients have worked with to cover the balance. sometimes this is a good option because it will allow you to spread the balance out over several months. many facilities offer a considerable discount to patients who are able to pay cash up front as well. asking all these questions could land you some nice discounts and an more affordable rate for your budget. if you find a facility that is highly recommended to you - don't be afraid to tell them how much you want to receive their service. the seemingly most inexpensive route is a government funded detox or rehab. government funded means that the program is funded by state and federal money. as for how much drug detox and/or rehab costs for these programs it is possible to pay a few hundred dollars and under and in some cases they are of no cost – depending of funding. traditional hospital detox (or rehab) may cost from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand depending on how much funding they receive from the government or outside agencies. although there are some luxury high-end private detox facilities and rehabs where the cost can start at $10 000 per day – it is also important to know that some private treatments may cost about $1 000 per day and offer some extra amenities. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	what resources are available for treating drug addiction if you don’t have insurance?
no there are not over-the-counter alternatives. adderall is a highly-abused drug that is often diverted sold or given to others so my skeptical eyebrows tend to raise when someone states that inadvertently threw it away. those of us in the medical profession get stories like this all of the time and unfortunately accidents can happen. perhaps he is telling the truth but if his adderall is gone. he will not likely get another prescription until his time is due. sir i am sure everything you say is true but your answer was very non-responsive. you are correct he will not get his renewed dosage for another four weeks. i stated that in my question and it is in fact the very reason i asked the question. secondly and happily his girlfriend found the bottle in one of their christmas shopping bags this morning. they had gone to the pharmacy while running christmas errands and things got mixed up a bit. thank you.	my 25 year old son lost his adderall and can't get a replacement for 30 days. is there an over the counter alternative? . my son got his new monthly prescription two days ago and inadvertently threw the bottle away thinking the bag it was in was empty. he will not be able to get his monthly dosage until his next appointment in 30 days. is there a safe over the counter alternative he can use which at the least will help to lessen the focus and concentration issues that will inevitably arise. thank you for any guidance you can give.

ivf is the most common type of art and there are other variations on the basic procedure some of which remain controversial. people should learn about both the benefits and risks of any medical procedure. intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi): a single sperm is injected into an egg. if the egg is fertilized and develops normally it is then transferred to the uterus. this has been a significant advance in treating men with low sperm count or disorders related to sperm movement. couples who undergo the procedure should be aware that if their infertility is caused by a genetic defect that defect could be passed to the child. pre-implantation genetic diagnosis: an individual cell from a growing embryo is removed and used for genetic screening during ivf. blastocystculture: a blastocyst a developed embryo is cultured and transferred to the uterus after five or six days compared with the three days for typical in vitro fertilization. cryopreservation: human eggs and embryos are frozen so that they can be kept viable. they are stored in liquid nitrogen at 320 degrees below zero. assisted hatching: an opening is created in the egg shell surrounding the embryo to help it implant in the uterus. this procedure has not been shown to be beneficial for everyone undergoing art. those who may benefit from assisted hatching include couples who have preserved embryos their own or donated by cryopreservation couples in which the mother is of an advanced age or couples with a history of multiple failed ivf attempts. the fda does not regulate individual art procedures but the agency has cleared devices for use in art procedures. examples are biopsy devices dissection needles sperm and embryo delivery catheters and solutions used to process and maintain sperm eggs and embryos.	what other assisted reproductive technologies (art) are used to treat infertility?

i don't necessarily think this is going to save you money. believe it or not xl and cds and things like that are actually once a day formulations which means you don't have to purchase as much of the medication for it to work for what the doctor or healthcare provider is trying to treat you. we found that a lot of people even struggle with just taking their medication once a day if you don't have this extended release formulation you have to take it two three four times a day. i found out a lot of patients forget or don't take it at all. so in the long run it actually costs you money because you are not taking your medication in the right way. you are actually going to probably get sicker and maybe go to the emergency room or visit your doctor a little bit more and in the long run healthcare cost go up. drugs are a small component of that and i think a lot of people underestimate how important it is that these extended release products are actually a benefit and worth the money.	how can avoiding medications with xl la xr or cr in their name save me money?

produce can become contaminated with salmonella shigella or e. coli during growing harvesting processing storing or shipping. it’s particularly important that you wash your spinach lettuce tomatoes sprouts and melons before handling or cutting them. wash all fruits and vegetables under running water before eating cutting or cooking unless they’re packaged and marked “prewashed. ” produce with a tough outer skin like melons and cucumbers can be scrubbed with a clean produce brush and warm soapy water before you cut into them — just in case there is bacteria on the peel. unwashed hands are the most common cross-contamination agent between raw meat poultry seafood eggs unwashed vegetables and ready-to-eat foods according to a study on food handling behaviors published in the journal of the american dietetic association. wash your hands longer and more often than you think you should. scrub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds with hot soapy water. it takes that long for the soap and scrubbing to remove some of the germs.	what food safety tips can reduce potential exposure to e. coli?

no single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. most doctors use a combination of the following methods to diagnose the disease and rule out other conditions: clinical history the doctor begins by asking the patient to describe the symptoms and when and how the condition started as well as how the symptoms have changed over time. the doctor will also ask about any other medical problems the patient and close family members have and about any medications the patient is taking. accurate answers to these questions can help the doctor make a diagnosis and understand the impact the disease has on your life. physical examination the doctor will check the patient’s reflexes and general health including muscle strength. the doctor will also examine bothersome joints and observe the patient’s ability to walk bend and carry out activities of daily living. x rays doctors take x rays to see how much joint damage has been done. x rays of the affected joint can show such things as cartilage loss bone damage and bone spurs. but there often is a big difference between the severity of osteoarthritis as shown by the x ray and the degree of pain and disability felt by the patient. also x rays may not show early osteoarthritis damage before much cartilage loss has taken place. magnetic resonance imaging also known as an mri magnetic resonance imaging provides high-resolution computerized images of internal body tissues. this procedure uses a strong magnet that passes a force through the body to create these images. doctors often use mri tests if there is pain; if x-ray findings are minimal; and if the findings suggest damage to other joint tissues such as a ligament or the pad of connective tissue in the knee known as the meniscus. other tests the doctor may order blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms. he or she may also order a joint aspiration which involves drawing fluid from the joint through a needle and examining the fluid under a microscope.	how do doctors diagnose osteoarthritis?

most lip plumpers work as a local irritant. these “plumpers” contain ingredients that might cause temporary swelling such as peppermint oil peppers and menthoxypropanediol a potent derivative of menthol. unfortunately there are not many scientific or multi-institutional studies to demonstrate the long-term efficacy of lip plumpers. if you're looking for a slight temporary plumping of the lips for a special evening out you may be satisfied with the results you get from these cosmetic lip plumpers. if your lips are thin and you're looking for that bee stung look you'll likely be disappointed. use of a lip plumper combined with cosmetic techniques that add the illusion of fuller lips such as using a lip liner slightly outside the natural line of the lips may provide a more satisfying illusion of fullness or you can always play up one of your better features such as your eyes to draw attention away from your thin lips. <link> <link>	do over-the-counter lip-plumping products really work?

ouch! having both elbows injured at the same time can't be fun! the bottom line is this: if you're concerned about your elbow not feeling better after 6 weeks then there's nothing wrong with going back to the doctor and having it re-examined. if nothing else it will give you peace of mind. it's possible the elbow that wasn't x-rayed sustained a soft tissue injury. these can be very painful and slow to heal. it sounds like you have full range of motion with that elbow which is good. in other words you can bend it fully. that's always a good sign. still when in doubt check it out. you can start with your primary care provider. he or she will take an x-ray if needed and hopefully get you on the path to being pain-free. good luck!	injured elbows 6 wks ago. one xrayed & stitches. both still tender & one not xrayed hurts most. tiny bones protruding mo. both elbows are still sore and the one not xrayed or examined most hurts most. the tiny bone on top and bottom that are visible when bending arm across in front of myself stick out more than my other elbow. should i be concerned after 6 weeks and/or have that elbow looked at again?

"real testosterone supplements are a controlled substance that can only be obtained by prescription. the so-called ""male enhancement"" products you hear advertised cannot by law contain testosterone or any other controlled substance. however a number of these male enhancement pills have been recalled and confiscated over the past few years by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) because they contained illegal and unlabeled amounts of prescription drugs designed to treat erectile dysfunction. this tells me that these supplements may not be safe to take. it may be difficult to tell exactly what's in them. if you believe you have low testosterone or have male performance issues i suggest you consult a medical professional. he or she will treat your concerns with sensitivity and dignity. many of these problems can be effectively treated. and no: ""low-t"" is not an epidemic. men naturally produce less testosterone as they age. for some men this causes problem getting or sustaining an erection loss of libido and loss of energy. if you fall into this category you certainly may want to seek treatment because testosterone therapy has been shown to improve these symptoms. best wishes to you!"

"remember that any fever in a newborn infant (under 3 months of age) needs prompt medical attention because at that age it’s hard to tell when a serious infection might be present. a fever is the body’s natural response to infection or other illness and will subside when the underlying process gets better. other than treating the infection (or other condition) causing it no home treatments can shorten the duration of a fever. also remember that fever doesn’t always need to be treated. if a toddler is acting normally and unbothered by her fever and her temperature is less than 104 degrees (40 degrees celsius) there’s no need to treat the fever. for a fever that’s high or is bothering your toddler either acetaminophen (mapap tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) are good treatments. you’ll need to know your toddler’s weight (don’t guess) and use the dosing guidelines on the package. it’s best to stick with one medicine if you can. if you feel you need to use multiple drugs call your pediatrician’s office. don’t ever use aspirin to treat a child’s fever as it increases the risk for reye’s syndrome. if sponging with water helps your child with a fever feel better use a warm bath (not cool) with water around 85 degrees. i know it sounds weird but my great granny used to cut an onion in half and put one half on the bottom of each foot then cover with socks and leave them on me all night. (in addition to tylenol or advil) when i would wake up in the morning my fever would be gone (or at least drasticly reduced) and the onions in my socks would be black. she said the onions drew the fever away from the brain and other vital organs. i don't unserstand how it works but i used this on my children and now on my grands and it works every time. it helps to understand what a fever is. some of the answers on here are very misleading and aren't factual at all. a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature. most common cause of this is an infection of some kind. the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body. the brain has a set point for our temperature 98. 6f. it is like a central heating/cooling system with a thermostat in a house. if the temp gets hot the a/c turns on. if it gets to cold the heater kicks on. and the temperature stays at 98. 6f. what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat. so the brain now has a set point of 101 f. but the body is still 98. 6 f. so the heater kicks on. you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat. you feel cold and you get under covers to get warm. this is why people say they are so cold when their temp is 100 because the thermostat is set to 101 or higher. the body does this because some of the bodies defenses are activated at higher temperatures and some bacteria don't function well at higher temperatures. so they die or we kill them better with a higher temperature. so what is it when a fever ""breaks""? well eventually your white blood cells kill everything and they stop releasing those chemicals that changes the thermostat. so the thermostat changes back to 98. 6f. now you have a temperature of 101f and your body is set to 98. 6f. it is too hot. turn on the a/c. so you start sweating to cool yourself off. this is a fever ""breaking"". so when the person with the fever is sweating like there is no tomorrow it is a good thing and you can probably expect the fever to start going back down. fever is a natural defense mechanism against foreign invaders of your body. it is very normal. as long as my fever isn't over 102f it makes sense to me to not interfere with the natural process. even help it. if i'm running a little fever i'll get in the hot tub or a nice hot bath. fevers can be very dangerous and you should ask your doctor when those dangerous temperatures are. they are different for kids and adults. to answer the question the fastest easiest way to break a fever is with anti-inflammatory medications like tylenol and motrin. but that doesn't mean everything is all better. and by the way: water is zero calories! (in case you read the other post) don't believe any of that stuff. what i do is rub my baby down with green rubbing alcohol. it works every time. a fever is not your body fighting an infection. anything that heats up your body including heat and induces sweating causes a fever. fevers cause heat exhaustion and heat stroke as heat heats up the body inducing sweating wich causes water to be ejected from the body. you may induce a fever and prove this by simply visiting a steam room and when your sweating check your temp youll have a fever. you may also go out jogging and see when your hot and sweating you have a fever with a fever thermometer. if you do either for long periods youll eventualy drop from exhaustion enjoying before that mild to severe dehydration symptoms heat exhaustion and heat stroke and possible mild heart attacks. cardio excersize and steam rooms have been around for centuries inducing fever and not cured any disease other than treat obesity. your heartrate can generate heat and cause a fever by pumping friction wich happens during jogging just like shaking a pop can or rubbing your hands generates warmth. make sure you maintain bodyweight during a fever. if food poisioning is suspect having a person stomach pumped and an enema given may be needed if fatigue sets in. fluid calories are better during a fever its important to maintain heartrate as lowering your heartrate also induces fatigue. if a fever is starting with no fatigue water may be ok. its important to keep dry and keep cool (keeping dry to avoid chills). humans thrive in cool temp climates of 55-65 degrees thier is little life in deserts do to heat heat starves an area of water. for children its important that children playing maintain thier bodyweight during excersize/play and eat and drink and take rest breaks and normalize thier heartrate reducing sweating. if people have to loose weight then i recommend simply getting out and walking bringing food fluids before or during thier walk to avoid dehydration with rest breaks. obesity causes fever and dehydration by carrying around 50-100 lb weights. you may simulate obesity by carrying a backpack of 50-100+ lb barebell weights and grow it daily and see what affects that has on your health. weather and activie levels can affect weight loss. people eat drink and rest to maintain thier heartrate and energy levels. in a virus or poision a fever is a response to excess blood volume wich causes your heart to pump harder and faster generating heat. you may simulate this by giving an unnecessary blood transfusion wich will likely cause a fever and may cause a mild heart attack so i wouldnt advise it. water causes weight gain at 1/2 lb a cup its a myth its zero caloric. overdrinking from dehydrationcan cause excessive urination in addition to lowering your heartrate further so cold water if a fever has started with no fatigue otherwise fluid calories."	how do you break a fever in a toddler?

"" the remaining insulin -producing cells in your pancreas are working harder to supply enough insulin for your body. you may take little or no insulin. but this does not mean that the disease is gone. after the remaining insulin-producing cells are destroyed the honeymoon period ends and you will need to take insulin for the rest of your life. treatment for your diabetes includes following a diet that spreads carbohydrate throughout the day getting regular physical activity monitoring your blood sugar levels (using a home blood sugar meter) and taking insulin. by working closely with your doctor and following your prescribed treatment you will feel better and have more control of your life. if your child has type 1 diabetes treatment involves the same tasks but allows for normal growth and development. before diagnosis your insulin level may have been low enough to cause severe high blood sugar with symptoms such as confusion or even coma. this condition is called diabetic ketoacidosis and often requires treatment in a hospital. during your hospital stay you are given insulin injections and fluids in a vein (intravenous or iv) and your condition is monitored closely. you are still at risk for this emergency in the future if you don't take enough insulin to keep your sugar levels and metabolism normal. if you have persistent high blood sugar levels over a long period of time diabetes can damage your: eyes ( diabetic retinopathy ). kidneys (diabetic nephropathy). nerves ( diabetic neuropathy ). heart (leading to heart attacks ). blood vessels (leading to strokes and poor circulation in your legs). if you keep your blood sugar level within a normal to near-normal range you may prevent or at least delay these complications. children seem protected from developing these complications during childhood. but when they become adolescents their risk begins to increase. keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible at the beginning of the disease will help prevent these complications. 3 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."	what happens to someone when they get type 1 diabetes recently diagnosed?
screening tests are those that are done at regular intervals to detect a disease such as prostate cancer at an early stage. if the result of a screening test is normal the disease is presumed not to be present. if a screening test is abnormal the disease is then suspected to be present and further tests usually are needed to confirm the suspicion (that is to make the diagnosis definitively). prostate cancer usually is suspected initially because of an abnormality of one or both of the two screening tests that are used to detect prostate cancer. these screening tests are a digital rectal examination and a blood test called the prostate specific antigen (psa). in the digital rectal examination the doctor feels (palpates) the prostate gland with his gloved index finger in the rectum to detect abnormalities of the gland. thus a lump irregularity or hardness felt on the surface of the gland is a finding that is suspicious for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a digital rectal examination in men age 40 and over. the psa test is a simple reproducible and relatively accurate blood test. it is used to detect a protein (the prostate specific antigen) that is released from the prostate gland into the blood. the psa level is usually higher than 4ng/ml in people with prostate cancer than in people without the cancer. situations of large prostate size infection and inflammation are other reasons why the psa may be elevated. the psa therefore is valuable as a screening test for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a psa in men age 40 and over. subsequent screening is recommended based on individual preference and assessment of risk for developing prostate cancer. for example patients with a high risk of developing prostate cancer due to a family history or a high initial psa should have more frequent evaluation (usually annually). although still considered controversial most urologists recommend regular screening for prostate cancer in men who are likely to live for more than 10 years. the american urological association (aua) issued their latest guidelines for prostate cancer in 2009. according to these men at the age of 40 should be offered a baseline psa test and a prostate exam (digital rectal exam or dre) to ascertain the risk of prostate cancer. subsequent screening and tests may be performed according to the findings on this initial evaluation and an individual's risk of getting the disease on the basis of other factors such as race ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer. as mentioned most urologists currently would advise some form of screening in men with a life expectancy greater than 10 years. most frequently it would be performed on an annual basis. although there is no definite cutoff age to stop prostate cancer screening most physicians would rarely screen men more than 75 years of age for this disease. results of the psa test under 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood are generally considered normal. there is a recent trend however to perform prostate biopsy in all patients with a psa more than 2. 5 ng/ml in order to detect prostate cancer at an earlier (and hopefully completely curable) stage. the american urological association guidelines (2009) do not define a definite cutoff point but advise that all the other risk factors for prostate cancer should be taken into account while making a decision on whether to proceed for a biopsy. one of the important factors that needs to be considered is the rate at which the psa value has increased over time on repeated measurements (psa velocity). results between 4 and 10 are considered borderline. these borderline values are interpreted in the context of the patient's age symptoms signs family history and changes in the psa levels over time. results higher than 10 are considered abnormal suggesting the possibility of prostate cancer. it has been shown that the higher the psa value the more likely the diagnosis of prostate cancer. moreover the level of psa tends to increase when the cancer has progressed from organ-confined prostate cancer to local spread to distant (metastatic) spread. very high values such as 30 or 40 and over are usually caused by prostate cancer.	what are the screening tests for prostate cancer?
during the manic phase of bipolar disorder behavior can become reckless. this may increase the risk of danger for both the patient and those who may be in their charge such as children. additionally in rare cases patients experiencing mania may become psychotic hearing voices or seeing things which may in turn incite a violent reaction. during an episode patients should be discouraged from driving or operating any machinery. if a friend or family member suffers from bipolar disorder contact their doctor as soon as an episode becomes apparent. sometimes early treatment can help reduce the incidence of dangerous behaviors.	are people with bipolar disorder considered dangerous to others?
an ankle sprain happens to many people. if you have been walking and there is a ditch or the road is lower your ankle can turn and cause and injury to the ligaments. ankle sprains can be mild moderate or severe. if you have injured only a little bit of the ligament you may be able to walk on the foot and just have mild swelling. with a more severe sprain you will not be able to walk. most importantly it is important to treat the ankle well while healing. this means full rest elevation of the ankle ice and medicine to reduce the swelling. stay off of that foot either resting or with crutches for at least 7-10 days. if you did not do that it is possible that the ankle ligament is not properly healed. in your case its important to see your doctor again if it is still causing you pain.	i sprained my ankle over a month ago and i still have pains. . . i am sure it was over a month ago give or take a few days. but i am still experiencing pains in the back of my ankle on top and on the side some. i have went to the doctor and they did an x-ray and said things looked fine but since i am still having problems i feel like something else is wrong. could i possibly have a fracture or is it just a prolonged pain? .

a cast protects and immobilizes a fracture so that it will properly heal. most people are casted for six weeks or so (depending on the type and extent of the fracture) so entire joints are frozen in place for a long time. when the cast is removed and the fracture has sufficiently healed those immobilized tendons and muscles will need to be gradually stretched back and strengthened again. it can take a few days or longer for your range of motion to gradually return to normal. be patient. it can be sore and painful to move that joint for a while.	hi i just got my cast of my wrist and i cant bend it back or forward like normal. is this normal? . hi i just got my cast of my wrist and i cant bend it back or forward like normal. is this normal?

catching a cold with emphysema or chronic bronchitis may also lead to bacterial infections such as pneumonia. this occurs because of the airway obstruction and the inability to cough up infected mucus. sometimes patients with copd are hospitalized because of a respiratory infection and the worsening of their symptoms. treatment may include inhaled medications oxygen and antibiotics to treat any bacterial infection. antibiotics do not treat a cold. to avoid more serious problems with emphysema chronic bronchitis and colds it's important to always alert your doctor if your cold symptoms get worse. don't wait until you have more serious breathing problems to contact your doctor.	why should i take colds seriously with emphysema or chronic bronchitis?

well that's quite interesting isn't it? the appendix is not an organ capable of growing back. in fact the appendix isn't an organ at all. it's an anatomical structure a tubelike sac that hangs off the large intestine where that structure meets the small intestine. doctors and scientists are still debating what function if any the appendix performs. so to your question. first i would ask if you're positive your appendix was removed. in other words was it taken out due to a case of appendicitis or was it removed in conjunction with another operation. sometimes for example a surgeon will remove the appendix at the same time the gallbladder or an ovary is removed. if that's the case maybe you were misinformed about whether it really was removed or not. if you're positive the appendix was removed then i'd say someone is misreading the ultrasound image. it's possible they're seeing some fleshy tissue or fatty tissue and identifying it as the appendix. hope this helps!	can the appendix grow back? . i have had my appendix removed back in 1989. i have had several scans ultrasounds over the past few years that have indicated my appendix looked good. how can that be if it was removed? is it possible it has grown back?

most reactions to vaccines are mild and self-limited. these are usually limited pain swelling and redness at the site of the vaccination. these occur in up to 80% of individuals and start within hours of the vaccination. some people can get more generalized symptoms including fever muscle aches headache loss of appetite and feeling generally tired. these systemic (generalized) reactions are seen more commonly with live attenuated vaccines and usually occur seven to 21 days after the vaccine was given. the worst (and very uncommon) reaction is anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction). these reactions usually occur shortly after the vaccine is given and can be life-threatening. fortunately these reactions only occur two times for every million doses of vaccine given.	what reactions are likely after an immunization?
most helpful answer keloids are very challenging to remove so you will need the services of a good dermatologist to help you. steroid injections are often used but there are other methods that the dermatologist can discuss with you. this is not something you can do at home or with any over-the-counter medications. surgically removing a keloid is iffy since the surgery alone can create a new keloid to replace the one that was removed.	i have a keloid on my chest but don't know what kind it is and want to get rid of it. i have had this keloid for 8 yrs it has never gotten bigger or smaller it is not that big its about the size of a nipple on a woman's breast a quite small one doesn't hurt or itch really ever hard dark i am african american when i was little i was scratching my chest a lot one day and the next morning a bump appeared and then the bumped turned darker and now it a keloid i guess not sure if i can use something to get rid of it or if i have to get injections surgery ect

but if you're still in doubt just call your dr. 's office and ask for the nurse. the nurse should be able to advise you.	i have had the flu for a few days and now have developed a rash on my fore arms and hands and my knees and inner thighs. i had been running a fever of varying degrees between 99 and 101. my normal temp is 97. 6. a friend saw the rash and said it is a fever rash. but i can't find any info on it. it does not itch or hurt. just looks very red and angry.
the single worst thing you can do to a pimple is pick. these are not surgical instruments you should not be doing this to your skin. so i do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. but i also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. so anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it's using the tool or your fingers you do have some risk of scarring. so every pimple blackhead whitehead or a pustule or papule all starts out as a same thing. our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles which are called pores. at the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well called p. acnes. for some reason which we don't fully understand why that is the opening of the follicle can become blocked and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go it can't get to the surface. so as it builds up it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white that's a whitehead. if it opens to the surface it gets oxidized and that's a blackhead. so a blackhead isn't dark because it's dirty it's dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. if there is a p. acnes bacteria that's growing at the base of that follicle now that the follicle is closed this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. so once the covering gets closed there is no more oxygen the bacteria wakes up and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. and now its got an abundance of food supplies so it starts to flourish and that can look like a pimple. so when you pick at it what you do is you create an inflammatory response which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar and more likely to come back in the same spot so picking is very bad. but your dermatologist can help extract that for you or give you a treatment like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.	do they really work to remove blackheads and how do they work?
i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group 60-100 (just celebrated a 101sst birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease.	is it normal for a patient to have anxiety when having an uncurable severe illness?

there are problems with the fat burning option on the cardio machines and it really ought to be eliminated. the idea behind the fat-burning option is this: because fat is denser than carbohydrate it requires more oxygen to burn. so to maximize the percentage of fat you burn compared to carbohydrate the fat-burning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles. that generally means a slow pace to keep you from getting breathless. the problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed you burn fewer total calories -- from both carbohydrate and fat -- because you simply don't do as much work. further the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range (usually 60% to 85% of your maximum heart rate) which is hard to do at slower speeds. and fitness is ultimately what you're after whether your goals are better health burning calories or improving heart and lung capacity. the bottom line is that the fat-burning mode probably won't be intense enough to maximize total calorie- or fat-burning or to help you increase or maintain optimum fitness levels. use the cardio mode to maximize your exercise benefits. using the fat burning mode on exercise machines at the gym actually isn’t the best way to burn fat. the key concepts to understand here are the percentage of calories that come from fat and total calories. the fat burning mode is typically set at lower exercise intensity where more calories burned come from fat. not as many calories burned during higher exercise intensity will come from fat. the point to understand though is that while more of the calories that you burn will come from fat at a lower exercise intensity you have the potential to burn more calories per session doing higher exercise intensity. the percentage of calories burned from fat will be lower during the higher exercise intensity but you will be burning more calories overall including the amount of calories from fat. also higher exercise intensity leads to a greater boost in metabolism even after you’re done exercising which burns additional calories. it’s best to do exercise that you’re comfortable with and that meets your level of training/conditioning. in general however increasing the time spent on exercise and increasing exercise intensity will provide a greater potential to burn more calories and lose weight.	what's the difference between the fat-burning mode and the cardio mode on the machines at the gym?
menstrual cramps very common. there are few different ways that can be treated. the first way is actually through a heating pad or using something like thermacare makes a heat wrap that could be applied to the inside of the clothing and it'll provide heat. and heat has been found to be very beneficial in treating that. also where appropriate you could take things like ibuprofen or motrin advil or even aleve. we want to make sure that the patients understand they need to take this with food. on a full stomach because if you don't you might experience a little bit of an upset stomach or some stomach cramping. and also just try to get some rest and eat well. so many times females are running around they are trying to take care of our families and do a lot of different things. but we forget to take care of ourselves at the end of the day. so just making sure that you get a little extra sleep around this particular time of the month and also making sure that you are eating well that's very important as well.	what is the best treatment for menstrual cramps?

i don’t think that there is quite enough research yet to justify the claim that red peppers can treat hypertension. the simple answer is that there never is one “super food” that should be emphasized more than any other to treat any health condition. i would suggest looking into the dash diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). the dash diet emphasizes fruits vegetables fat-free or low-fat dairy products whole grain products fish poultry and nuts. it’s also lower in red meat sugars and sodium. this diet has been shown to lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people. a healthy eating plan such as the dash diet along with a consistent cardiovascular exercise routine can be part of an effective treatment and management plan for hypertension. consult with your doctor further and please visit the following website for more information: <link>	is red pepper a good supplement to treat hypertension. i have read that a ingrediant in red pepper is very good at treating hypertension
