without treatment the symptoms of ocd can progress to the point that the sufferer's life becomes consumed inhibiting their ability to keep a job and maintain important relationships. many people with ocd have thoughts of killing themselves and about 1% complete suicide. in terms of the prognosis for the specific symptoms it is rare for any to progress to a physically debilitating level. however problems like compulsive hand washing can eventually cause skin to become dry and even to break down. repeated trichotillomania can result in unsightly scabs on the person's scalp.	what happens if obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) is not treated?

that would be a reasonable course of action. sinusitis can be a bit tricky to treat and often one course of antibiotics may not do it. in light of the fact that you are still having facial pain (and pressure? ) and are still congested and coughing you may need further care -- perhaps a stronger or different antibiotic (assuming you had an antibiotic the first round) and something more to control your symptoms. you should go back to your doctor because there are quite a number of reasons why your symptoms may have not be alleviated such as the cause of your sinus infection may have not been bacterial rather viral therefore antibiotics were futile to the infection and so on.	i was just treated for a sinus infection but still feel bad- do i head back to the doc? . i finished all the medication as prescribed but am still congested coughing and have face pain

while everybody is different that constant hunger that occurs the first few months of pregnancy usually subsides by the second trimester. while appetite is still robust the second trimester it can be satisfied with balanced meals and regular intervals of eating. typically by the end of the third and last trimester appetite decreases as the baby tends to push on the stomach causing early fullness. for more on eating right during pregnancy see this webmd article. congratulations on your pregnancy!	does being hungry all the time subside after a month or two of being pregnant?

you may be able to continue getting assistance with your medications. the law won't stop prescription drug programs. however all health plans sold through the marketplaces must cover the cost of prescriptions. and if your income qualifies you for subsidies you may find that a big chunk of the cost of your medication is covered through the plans available to you. the only way to know for certain is to shop your options. in new york the online marketplace is called new york state of health. here's the link to the website where you can begin to compare health plans: <link>	right now i have no insurance and patient assistance pays for my 388. 00 a month medication. how much will i have to pay for it on the silver plan?
call your doctor if you notice any of the symptoms of pneumonia. in many instances you need immediate treatment to recover and avoid complications. in addition call your doctor if: your sharp chest pain does not get better with prescribed treatment; you have increased shortness of breath; or your fingernails toenails or skin becomes dark or develops a bluish tinge after diagnosis. this may mean that you are not getting enough oxygen into your blood and you need medical assistance. you cough up blood; you may need additional treatment for a worsening infection.	when should i call the doctor if i have or think i might have pneumonia?
narrowing down your home pharmacy to just ten medicines — will simplify your life and free up some room in those medicine cabinets that may be overflowing. use the kiss rule: keep it safe and simple. first take out all of those medicines and line them up on a table. look at the expiration dates and dispose of any old ones. if you have any leftover antibiotics from prescriptions you never finished throw all of those away too. medications for conditions that you no longer have or are unlike to have can be discarded as well. group your home pharmacy into categories: cold medicines ointments/creams pain/fever medications etc. this will help you find duplicates — medicines of different brand names that do the same thing. the categories of medicines that you should have in your home pharmacy: pain and fever medications: acetaminophen (tylenol) and ibuprofen (advil motrin) in both adult and child strengths (if you have children). if you have an infant you may need infant strengths as well. remember that ibuprofen also has anti-inflammatory properties. antiseptic solutions: cuts and wounds should be carefully cleansed so your pharmacy should have hydrogen peroxide betadine solution or the equivalent. topical antibiotics: your choice. they come in both ointments (greasy but protective) and creams (rubs in easily) and all are considered equally efficacious for the prevention and treatment of minor skin infections. some topical antibiotics are better for burns — you should have a burn ointment in your cabinet. hydrocortisone: this topical steroid is also available in creams and ointments. used for itching treating mosquito bites etc. antifungal medications: use for athlete’s feet or fungal diaper rashes. if the woman in the house is prone to occasional vaginal yeast infections some miconazole (monistat) is nice to have available. stomach and intestinal disorders: include a good stool softener such as colace (docusate sodium) or a mild laxative such as milk of magnesia. i do not routinely treat minor diarrhea but having kaopectate or even pepto-bismol at home would be helpful. over-the-counter tagamet (cimetidine) or prilosec (omeprazole) would be appropriate to include along with maalox or mylanta. salt: you can get this from the kitchen but making your own saline (1/4 tsp of salt to 8 oz of water) can be used for gargling or homemade nasal spray/drops. antihistamines: drying up a watery nose or controlling itchy allergies. benadryl (diphenhydramine) is the most common but it can be sedating. claritin (loratadine) or zyrtec (cetirizine) lasts longer (24 hours) and both are considered non-sedating. all are available in both adult and children formulations. decongestants: medications containing pseudoephedrine (sudafed) or phenylephrine are for stuffy/congested noses. they can be stimulating and may interfere with sleep. decongestants also drain mucous so taking them at night is going to cause a river of drainage. it is best to do this during the day when you can blow your nose. cough medicines: there are two types: expectorants (makes you cough by loosening mucous) and suppressants (controls or reduces coughing). it is important to know your goal when you select one. guaifenesen (mucinex) is a mucous-thinning expectorant. plain robitussin is a cough expectorant. medicines that contain dextromethorphan (dm) such as delsym can suppress a cough. combination medicines like robitussin dm have both an expectorant and a suppressant — sort of makes you cough and tries to stop it at the same time! coughing is a normal bodily response to clear the airway so it does not necessarily need to be controlled but having a quiet comfortable night is okay. miscellaneous: band-aids (all types including finger-tip ones) gauze dressings telfa (non-stick) pads paper tape and other dressings are always needed. each home pharmacy will need to be individualized and only you can do it. the home pharmacy of someone with children will be totally different than a family without kids. medicines need to be securely locked if you have kids or grandchildren visiting. always use discretion and avoid over-medication. follow dosage recommendations and avoid the home treatment of things that have not been properly diagnosed — even if you are the one diagnosing them. use your medical provider as a consultant if you have doubts.	what kinds of medicines do i need to stock at home?
joint replacements are the most common surgeries doctors use to treat joint complications from paget's disease such as osteoarthritis of the hip or knee joints. if a joint has been damaged by this disease and is causing pain your doctor may recommend a joint replacement (depending on the affected joint). osteotomy removes a wedge of bone to help reshape the remaining bone. an osteotomy for the hip or knee is another bone surgery that may help delay a joint replacement. but it is usually only a good choice for a younger person. for more information on joint replacement surgery see: hip replacement surgery. knee replacement surgery. sometimes doctors may do surgery to take pressure off a nerve (such as a nerve pinched by extra bone forming in the spine) or to correct deformed bone (such as bowed legs ). if you have paget's disease and are going to have bone or joint surgery you may need medicine for a period of time before surgery to slow the breakdown of bone tissue and decrease the risk of bleeding during surgery. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for pagets disease of bone?

condoms can leak so your still taking your chances. most contraceptive pills put a disclaimer on the package guaranteeing only 99% effectiveness. pulling out is not effective as a small amount of semen might still seep in even when you pull out. my opinion: your best bet is to have a vasectomy and/or a tubal ligation.	we are exclusive. she has been on the pill for months. we have both been tested for stds. is condom use needed? . we are both really ocd about pregnancy and stds that's why despite the fact that she is on the pill and has a cellphone alarm to ensure she takes it at the same time everyday and we've both been std tested we still have just used condoms. what is the risk of pregnancy if we didn't use condoms? is this reasonable to do? should i still try to pull-out?

your doctor is right. carbamazepine can get secreted in breast milk and it is the safest antiepileptic during lactation. 1 month old baby sleeps a lot. they can sleep for about 18 to 20 hours a day. they will wake up only for feeds. as long as the baby is gaining weight it is fine. also note that keeping your baby on breast milk has many advantages over formula. breast milk has enzymes which help in better digestion. breast milk also contains various antibodies produced in your body which provides immunity to the newborn. it is recommended that you breastfeed your baby for at least up to 6 months of age. for further information consult a lactation counselor online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am a mother of 1 month old baby, who is exclusively breastfed.

But, I am worried about his sleep patterns. Should I think about switching to formula milk?
it can be difficult to quit drinking alcohol especially as your body becomes chemically dependent after chronic or prolonged use. you may experience withdrawal symptoms as you attempt to quit. some of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can include anxiety depression headaches nausea and insomnia. one of the more severe symptoms of withdrawal however is delirium tremens which can cause intense confusion disorientation hallucinations hyperactivity and tremors. going through these withdrawal symptoms can be very difficult and can discourage people from wanting to or being able to quit successfully. perhaps the best thing that you can do is to get help. treatment options might include visiting a rehabilitation center or a mental health/hospital clinic. try meeting with support groups counselors/psychologists or speaking with a doctor. another option might also be trying medication that might help you to quit. please visit this site for more information: <link>. if it was easy to quit drinking alcohol everyone would probably do it. you are addicted and you need help with this disease. i would suggest that you start with aa (even if you don't want to go).	i'm an alcoholic why is it so hard to stop drinking? . once you start to cope with drinking then it becomes a bigger challenge to quit.

no. she is not going to kill cook or hard-boil those ovarian eggs. she is more likely to burn her belly. it would be a good idea to put a pillow or one of those special laptop trays to dissipate the heat from her computer use a table or not say on for so long. when she ovulates (once per month) her eggs will be safe.

"i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. i have struggled and struggled and even though i'm on daily meds i still have trouble. this answer is from my own experience and from my heart. people are genetically predisposed to bpd. that means we're born with it and will die with it. there is no cure. so the first way it affects us over time is that it is a constant ""cross to bear "" for our entire lives and we either cope or literally die. suicide risky behavior or pissing off the wrong person during an episode of rage are some threats to our existence. i have been dangerously near suicide four times - i remember them especially because i was serious. another way it affects us over time - it's like a failing marriage. things are ok a lot of the time but the more and more you argue with the same person about the same thing the frustration compounds and you would do anything just to make this so-and-so go away. well you can get out of a bad marriage. i've been aware of my disorder for five years now and i'm 35 so this is as far as my experience goes. i don't know how i will be at 40 50 60. but from the way it looks now my strategies will have to change and become more potent if i am to survive. it is literally a constant battle except that your sworn enemy and foe is inside your head. and it's smart. it's similar to our smartphones and apps now the ones that ""learn"" your search preferences and even your voice over time. it finds a way to use your own thoughts against you. for example if i am going through a mixed manic-depressive episode i believe (with all my heart! ) that no one loves me that i am a failure that i will never be ok and that i should just take myself out. it is literally temporary insanity! i am a healthy vibrant attractive career-oriented single mother of a beautiful daughter with a fully loving and supportive family a therapist who loves me and stays on standby and i have goals. i am a normal person. but during those times i am absolutely certain that i am alone that i will fail at my goals like so many times before and that i have no reason to go on living. its the disease. it talks to me in my head and it's hard to differentiate between the sane voice and the insane one until the episode is over. then i'm perfectly ok. just like that. lastly things that are affected over time are relationships with friends family and romantic relationships and jobs. we struggle with dealing with ourselves so of course others who have to deal with us struggle too. i have had to re-start my career 3 times because i would build up a great rep at a job and then eventually get fired for emotional instability. so that's where the ""failure"" thoughts come from - how do i know it won't happen again? just yesterday i couldn't stop crying for four hours at work even while interacting with my co-workers. i cannot control or guide when or how intense it will be when it hits. hope this helps!"	how does bipolar disorder affect someone over time?
recurrent dislocations and instability of shoulder should be operated surgically. in my opinion. you should give conservative treatment a chance. get a three week off gym and put your arm in sling in external rotation position. then gradually start rehabilitation. it seems you are carrying overloads in the gym. you need to lower the weights in your exercising to a tolerable amount and focus more on strenghtening anterior shoulder muscles (anterior fibers of deltoid ) stretch you posterior capsule. . thanks	I get frequent anterior shoulder dislocations will the situation get worse?

well the provisions about the preventive care really deal with insurance plans that are in the market. so what the affordable care act did was say starting with plan years jan. 1 2011 from that point on as plans are renewed individuals will no longer pay a co-pay for everything from getting their kids' immunizations to having mammograms or cancer screenings because we really want to encourage people to get checkups in advance to get situations identified which may cause serious health problems and get them found. in a case where someone. has no health insurance at all the best possibility really is to find the nearest community health center and community health centers are throughout the country talking to her health department about where is the closest community health center. community health centers are being expanded through the affordable care act but they are community-based providers of primary care and preventive care who deal with individuals who have full insurance who have partial insurance and people who have no insurance coverage at all. everything from cancer screenings often there's dental care available and checkups for kids. it's very high-quality low-cost care and that would be the best option.	i have no medical insurance. am i eligible for a free mammogram and if so how and where?

expiration dates on products whether it is medication or food are printed on the package for a reason. it is to protect you from damaging your body (making you ill) and to let you know that the product will no longer be effective. we wouldn't drink milk that is 2 weeks past its expiration so why would you want to take advil 2 weeks past the expiration? advil is used to treat pain fever and inflammation. you would not want to extend your symptoms due to taking an expired ineffective product. nor would you want to guess at how many tablets you have to take to get an effective dose increasing the possibility of toxicity and side effects. this is not a gray situation. it is black and white. either the medication is safe to take or not. if the medication has expired please do not ingest it. instead work with your pharmacy or local police department on how to dispose of expired medication.	how long after the expiration date can you use advil? would it hurt me if i took advil that has expired?

"yeast is an ""opportunistic"" fungal infection. yeast loves warm dark moist areas typical of a two-year old's diaper. yeast is airborne can colonize in the colon and can just happen to anyone if the right conditions exist. especially children with weaker less-challenged immune systems. children who recently used antibiotics for any reason are more likely to get diaper-area yeast infections. a urinary tract infection is very common in little girls especially those that are diapered. utis can be misdiagnosed if the urine specimen is not taken by a catheter and properly cultured in the lab. the most common pathogen causing a uti would be the various germs (enteric bacteria) present in stool that conveniently migrates into their tiny urethra. a urinary tract infection in little boys is uncommon and needs a higher level of diagnostic investigation."	what cause a two year old baby to have a yeast infection or urinary infection

yes it would be appropriate for you to see a medical provider so that you can have your throat properly examined. a sore throat primarily in the mornings wiht improvement in the afternoon may be due to post-nasal drainage at night accompanied by mouth-breathing. allergies can cause this but so can back to back viral infections. mononucleosis is a virus that can cause a sore throat. people also worry about a lingering strep infection so this can be tested for during your examination if your medical provider feels it is necessary. as you have read there are many possibilities to consider so you are wise to seek medical care at this point. i'd say so. it may be something minor like dryness due to furnace season being upon us or post-nasal drip but since the symptoms are bugging you and aren't responding to over-the-counter (otc) remedies you won't lose anything by seeing the doctor. it could be you have a sinus infection or something else that's treatable. and then you won't be uncomfortable anymore. best wishes to you!	have persistant mild-moderate sore throat been nearly two weeks. otc aids little relief. time to see doc?
this is a very good question because it shows that in pain management the therapy has to be patient-specific. both sandoz and mylan make generic versions of the duragesic patch. they both contain the same active ingredient but the way the medication is released through the patch may be different and it also depends upon your skin and how it absorbs medications. in cases like this i always talk to my patients to see what brand works better for them. i would suggest talking to your pharmacist and let them know that you have better results with the sandoz brand and would prefer to receive that brand in the future. this is a great example of something that you can talk to you pharmacist about. it is important that your pain is managed properly and if this helps in that cause it is an easy fix. hello when the doctor first put me on the fentanyl patch i tried many brands from the pharmacy. couple would not stick one actually was clear and you could see the gel/medicine in the actual patch etc. after trying many brands i found mylan was the 100% best kind. hope this helps. ty.	i used sandoz brand fentanyl patches and they worked well. my pharmacy switched me to mylan. is there a preferred brand? . they appear to be totally different looking -- you cannot see the liquid medication inside as you could with the sandoz. when i put the sandoz brand on i could immediately feel a rush and a funny taste in my mouth they began to work in about 45 minutes and the mylan don't seem to work as fast. is there a difference in brands? both were 75 mcg/h. i have been using the patches for about eight weeks.

"i am not a big fan of juice for babies (unless they are having problems with true constipation). when they start eating solids well you can give a little ""pure"" juice (not sugar-water flavored). fruit is better after about age six months. most of the time they do not need more water than what they are getting in breast milk or formula. if is hot outside it's okay to give a little water. it won't hurt them but you don't want them to fill up their little tummies with water to the point where they won't take nourishment."	what age can a baby start drinking water and juice?
when it comes to pregnancy pounds timing matters. chances are weight gain during the first three months will be minimal -- and should be according to the iom (institute of medicine) guidelines. you don't need any extra calories during the first trimester; although the baby's growth is rapid he is so small that his development doesn't warrant additional energy. however you may add some pounds to your frame during the first three months because you're hungrier or because of fluid retention. some women even lose weight because they don't feel well enough to eat their usual diet. once the second trimester starts and the baby's growth begins in earnest gaining weight on a steady basis is a must. plan on putting on about a pound each week with a prepregnancy bmi of 24. 9 and below and about a half pound a week if you had a prepregnancy bmi of 24. 9 and above.	when should i start gaining weight during pregnancy?
i'm sorry to hear you're feeling poorly. often the best initial treatment for vomiting is to avoid taking anything by mouth (including water) until the vomiting stops. then start with small sips of water to make sure you aren't going to start vomiting again. work your way up to regular food slowly. after the vomiting stops be sure to stay as well-hydrated as you can without triggering more nausea. if the vomiting is severe or doesn't clear up within a day you should seek medical attention. also if your vomiting is accompanied by other symptoms such as severe abdominal pain or head injury you should seek immediate medical attention. if you have no allergies to medication you can probably treat the vomiting and aches with over-the-counter medications. ask a pharmacist what he or she recommends. if you did not get a flu shot be aware the flu season is already underway. wash your hands frequently to avoid spreading the flu (if that's what you have) or any potentially contagious illness. hope you feel better soon!	what to take vomiting and achy feeling. started with upset stomach

"this is a very good question. to my knowledge there is no serious adverse reaction associated with taking famotidine with an antibiotic. however taking famotidine with an anti-fungal oral medication (such as the ones with names ending in ""azole"") can have serious side effects. taking certain antacid or anti-gerd medications like famotidine can reduce the effectiveness of other medications when taken together. thus it's a good idea to wait 1-2 hours before or after taking other medications before you take a product like famotidine. because you have finished your antibiotics (good for you! ) the real question is: do you still have symptoms of your illness? if not then you did no harm by combining the two medications. if you still feel ill then i'd suggest you go back to your primary care provider explain the situation and get evaluated to see if you need another course of antibiotics. in all likelihood everything worked out fine. at least that's my hope for you!"	does taking famotidine and antibiotics at the same time bad? i take them at the same exact time. i read somewhere to take famotidine 1-2 hrs before or after taking antibiotics i just finished up taking the other antibiotic i was on. anyway im jjst concerned that taking the antibiotics and famotidine at the same time is affecting the potency of the anti iotic helpp

depakote (valproate or valproic acid) is often used to treat juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. depakote is a broad-spectrum anti-seizure drug and can treat each of the three seizure types that occur in people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. other epilepsy drugs are effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy too. effective treatment depends on using a medicine that controls all three seizure types seen in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. keppra (levetiracetam) topamax (topiramate) and lamictal (lamotrigine) all treat juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. for most people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy treatment is long-term and often lifelong. however treatment is effective allowing most people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy to go five years or more between seizures.	how is juvenile myoclonic epilepsy treated?

most helpful answer yes you should go to the hospital. the content and tone of your question indicates that you are suffering greatly. it sounds like you've stopped medication so that your many physical and emotional symptoms will absolutely continue and may even worsen. you probably need to be in a hospital setting where your behavior can be monitored and an effective medication regime begun. close medical staff observation medication stabilization eating nutritious meals obtaining some peaceful rest and talk therapy are the necessary ingredients to regaining normalcy in your life.	do i need to go to the hospital for major depression lasting longer than 2 months?

one common cause of acid reflux disease is a stomach abnormality called a hiatal hernia. this occurs when the upper part of the stomach and lower esophageal sphincter (les) move above the diaphragm a muscle that separates your stomach from your chest. normally the diaphragm helps keep acid in our stomach. but if you have a hiatal hernia acid can move up into your esophagus and cause symptoms of acid reflux disease. these are other common risk factors for acid reflux disease: eating large meals or lying down right after a meal. being overweight or obese. eating a heavy meal and lying on your back or bending over at the waist. snacking close to bedtime. eating certain foods such as citrus tomato chocolate mint garlic onions or spicy or fatty foods. drinking certain beverages such as alcohol carbonated drinks coffee or tea. smoking. being pregnant. taking aspirin ibuprofen certain muscle relaxers or blood pressure medications.	what causes acid reflux disease?

"both of these terms refer to the bones of the spine. the spine is made up of 24 vertebrae (not including the sacrum and coccyx). each vertebra is smooth and rounded on the ""front facing"" side and has bony protrusions on the ""back facing"" side. when you run your hand down someone's back you feel those protrusions. each vertebra has a large hole in the center through which the spinal cord passes. each vertebra also has smaller holes (called foramina) through the sides which allow the roots of larger nerves to branch off from the spinal cord and extend into the rest of the body. ""foraminal stenosis"" refers to a narrowing of these smaller holes or channels in the sides of the vertebrae. often foraminal stenosis is caused by arthritis or bone spurs that basically clog up the channels and put pressure on the nerve roots. remember those bony protrusions i referred to earlier? those things help link the vertebrae together. each of them has two joints called ""facets"" that allow you to bend forward and backward.

"aw i'm sorry for your little one. you're certainly describing the classic symptoms of constipation. luckily there are a few things you can do at home to see if you can help your child have a bowel movement. however if your child goes more than a couple of days without a bowel movement you need to call your pediatrician. one thing you can do is give your child some prune juice. unless your child has blood sugar problems (diabetes) he or she should be able to tolerate this treatment just fine. prune juice is a tried and true approach to constipation relief. the best way to ""treat"" constipation is to prevent it. feed your child a healthy diet that includes plenty of fiber from whole grains fruits and vegetables. also make sure your child drinks plenty of water and gets some exercise every day. these three components are crucial in preventing constipation. please do not give your child a laxative without consulting your pediatrician. dosing can be tricky with children and your pediatrician is in the best position to advise you about what laxative to use and what dosage to give. wishing you all the best! you may have the answer. abdominal discomfort and inability to have a bowel movement in a five year old is typically constipation (the pain may be caused by gas) or even stool-holding (a condition where the child does not want to defecate and tries to hold it. ) if the continues to have pain and is not defecating he will need to be properly examined. if constipation has been a long-term issue he will need to see his medical provider anyway or some specific dietary intervention or perhaps the addition of a stool softener in his diet."	my 5 year old has stomach pains and cant poop.
hi found this for you. excess estrogen. estrogen the power player in women’s bodies is your friend when it’s appropriately balanced. it makes you feel energized helps stabilize your moods and contributes to a healthy sex drive. yet too much estrogen which can be caused by weight gain perimenopause or toxicity from exposure to endocrine disruptors (which are rampant in our food water and plastic products) can lead to thinning hair. during and after pregnancy for example estrogen levels peak and then dip causing sudden hair loss for many women. the best thing you can do is get a blood test done for a hormone check. do hope this helps you. good luck	can estrogen pills cause hair loss on your head? . i've been taking estradiol estrogen pills for two years. my hair has been thinning badly so i got a prescription for transdermal estradiol patches. one of the common side effects listed was hair loss but thats what i got the prescription to prevent. please help. i don't know whether to use the patch to stop my hair loss or stop using estradiol to stop my hair loss.

i think you get what you pay for in life and you get what you pay for in cosmetic surgeon’s office a consultation. i don’t think a free consultation is a good idea. first of all it implies that you don’t think it’s worth paying for. in other words if the patient doesn’t want to pay for service the patient should want to pay for service. it’s very important service because the answer may be that it’s not a good idea to have cosmetic surgery for x y and z reasons. and you’re going to get an honest opinion because you’re paying for the doctor’s time. otherwise often it’s kind of like a little bit of a come on frankly in some practices particularly practices that are high marketing high advertising more of a clinic different atmosphere than other practices. it makes it attractive to patients that say oh yeah it’s free what do i have to lose? but often they come in and then they are taken down a little road that they may not want to go to because sometimes there’s some pretty sophisticated marketing. by the way some of these clinics are owned by businessmen. doctors are employees. they just see this as another business and they hire a doctor just like a factory hires a line worker. so often it’s kind of a it’s a little bit unclear hang on a second… it’s an opening into what turns out to be too much of a slick operation. medical consultation should be professional and it shouldn’t be a hustle. it shouldn’t be slick and you shouldn’t feel pressured and sometimes people are. because frankly if everyone came in and consulted at no charge how could the clinic stay in business if it didn’t do surgery? now it’s now likely certainly a fair percentage need something but i think it’s healthier to pay for it. and frankly for many practices that $200 or $150 or whatever the number is they apply it to the procedure anyway if you’re comfortable or the doctor’s comfortable doing it so at least in that practice it really hasn’t cost you any more to consult. if you’re going to do consulting with 3 or 4 practices yes you could say wow $150 or $200 i’m going to be investing a fair amount of money but you know you’re also talking about a procedure that may be is thousands of dollars they are thousands most of the time certainly the bigger procedures like face lifting breast reduction tummy tucks it’s still a good investment because you’re going to learn. in my experience the practices that charge you for the consultation give you a lot more education. the practices that don’t charge you give you a lot more selling. but i don’t think you should be sold on this. i don’t think it’s something that you need to be drawn into. i think you have to approach it as a very very important consumer decision. it is your face it is your body even your health is on the line to a tiny tiny degree. so i think it is better to pay for the consultation. get free cosmetic surgery consultation - +91-9711-586-419.	should i pay for a cosmetic surgery consultation?

you should understand the difference between depression and disappointment. disappointment also manifest symptoms as in the case of the depression. were you deeply disappointed in the near past say within one year? you did not have any bad experiences and your family does not have any depression history. that is perfect. you feel numb sad and worthless. feeling irritable and spending more time alone. these are some of depression symptoms but your problem is never depression. from the given symptoms i see this as an attitude problem related to some sort of disappointment. you are just 19. i suggest you forcefully change your habit. do not be alone. be with family members or friends. if you do not have friends then make friends. go outside and socialize. engage in physical activities and outdoor or indoor games. you will have many things to study. do it. divert your attention to more productive creative and positive things rather than brooding yourself worthlessly. i do not see depression now. if you continue the present attitude and behavior further then it could lead to depressive disorder. please do compulsively as i advised. for further information consult a psychiatrist online --><link>	Hi doctor,I just wanted to ask a few questions and get an opinion. I have been experiencing symptoms of depression for the last two years and I do not know what to do. I do not want to get my family involved unless I know anything for sure and I do not even know if I have depression. I have not had any bad experiences that would have affected me enough to make me depressed and my family does not have a history of mental illness, which is what makes me waver. I feel numb, sad and worthless most of the time. I have found myself becoming more and more irritable and spending more and more time alone. I do not know whether this is just something my mind has conjured up or there is something actually wrong. I feel mad at myself whenever I think about this as I do not have any reason for feeling the things I feel. Anyway, I was just wondering if it sounds like I have depression or not. I really want to see a doctor, but I want to give my parents some explanation since they do not really understand how bad mental illness can be. Thank you.

genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on your medical history and a physical exam. your doctor may ask you the following questions: do you think you were exposed to genital herpes or another sexually transmitted disease ( std )? how do you know? did your partner tell you? what are your symptoms? do you have sores in the genital area or anywhere else on your body? do they usually come and go? do you have any urinary symptoms including frequent urination burning or stinging with urination or urinating in small amounts? if you have discharge from the vagina or penis it is important to note any smell or color. what method of birth control do you use? did you use condoms to protect against stds? which high-risk sexual behaviors do you or your partner engage in? have you had an std in the past? how was it treated? after the medical history is taken: a woman will have a gynecological exam. a pap test is not specific for genital herpes but may be included depending on the woman's medical history. a man will have a genital exam to check for hsv infection. your doctor may be able to diagnose genital herpes from your medical history and physical exam especially if the herpes sores are typical in appearance. but if this is your first outbreak of suspected genital herpes further testing may be done to confirm the diagnosis. herpes tests cannot always show if you have a primary genital herpes outbreak or you have been infected in the past. sometimes a test result can be negative even though the person has herpes. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for genital herpes?

all women see a decline in their fertility beginning around age 35 making it far more difficult -- but not impossible -- to conceive naturally. the risk of birth defects including down syndrome increases as a woman ages as does the risk of an ectopic pregnancy which can be life-threatening. treatments such as in vitro fertilization have made it possible to conceive well into the mid-40s. for many doctors however the cutoff point is around age 45 a time when many believe a woman’s eggs are no longer healthy enough for a normal conception -- although normal pregnancies can and do occur at this age. with the inception of donor eggs a woman could actually carry a child and give birth well into her 60s and beyond depending on her individual health status. although this is possible it is not necessarily a recommended or accepted practice.	with all the advances in fertility treatments how old is too old for a woman to try to get pregnant?

"in my opinion a 17 month old child should not have any ""over- the- counter"" medications given to them without the approval of a doctor. consult your child's pediatrician before giving any medication especially the first time. because of the potential for allergic reactions in babies they are much more likely than adults to have serious adverse drug consequences. dosing is another important consideration. appropriate dosing according to age and weight is an art best left to the physician. likewise specific instructions on either alternating or combining different ""over-the-counter"" medications should come only at the discretion of a doctor. many of these products contain the same or similar ingredients. even though some time may have elapsed between the transition from one medication to the other being given some of the first medication type may still remain in the child's system. doctors study pharmacology and are experienced in knowing the half-life of drugs as they are exhausted in the body. giving your child prescription or over-the-counter medication. is serious business."	can you alternate ibuprofen and tylenol with tamiflu on a 17 month old

"osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints. unlike many other forms of arthritis that are systemic illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus osteoarthritis does not affect other organs of the body. the most common symptom of osteoarthritis is pain in the affected joint(s) after repetitive use. joint pain is usually worse later in the day. there can be swelling warmth and creaking of the affected joints. pain and stiffness of the joints can also occur after long periods of inactivity (for example sitting in a theater). in severe osteoarthritis complete loss of the cartilage cushion causes friction between bones causing pain at rest or pain with limited motion. symptoms of osteoarthritis vary greatly from patient to patient. some patients can be debilitated by their symptoms. on the other hand others may have remarkably few symptoms in spite of dramatic degeneration of the joints apparent on x-rays. symptoms also can be intermittent. it is not unusual for patients with osteoarthritis of the finger joints of the hands and knees to have years of pain-free intervals between symptoms. osteoarthritis of the knees is often associated with excess upper body weight with obesity or a history of repeated injury and/or joint surgery. progressive cartilage degeneration of the knee joints can lead to deformity and outward curvature of the knees which is referred to as being ""bowlegged. "" people with osteoarthritis of the weight-bearing joints (like the knees) can develop a limp. the limping can worsen as more cartilage degenerates. in some patients the pain limping and joint dysfunction may not respond to medications or other conservative measures. therefore severe osteoarthritis of the knees is one of the most common reasons for total knee replacement surgical procedures in the united states. osteoarthritis of the cervical spine or lumbar spine causes pain in the neck or low back. bony spurs called osteophytes that form along the arthritic spine can irritate spinal nerves causing severe pain numbness and tingling of the affected parts of the body. osteoarthritis causes the formation of hard bony enlargements of the small joints of the fingers. classic bony enlargement of the small joint at the end of the fingers is called a heberden's node named after a very famous british doctor. the bony deformity is a result of the bone spurs from the osteoarthritis in that joint. another common bony knob (node) occurs at the middle joint of the fingers in many patients with osteoarthritis and is called a bouchard's node. dr. bouchard was a famous french doctor who also studied arthritis patients in the late 1800s. heberden's and bouchard's nodes may not be painful but they are often associated with limitation of motion of the joint. the characteristic appearances of these finger nodes can be helpful in diagnosing osteoarthritis. osteoarthritis of the joint at the base of the big toe of the foot leads to the formation of a bunion. osteoarthritis of the fingers and the toes may have a genetic basis and can be found in numerous female members of some families."	what are symptoms of osteoarthritis?

an important risk factor is age; more than 70 percent of men diagnosed with this disease are over the age of 65. african american men have a substantially higher risk of prostate cancer than white men including hispanic men. dramatic differences in the incidence of prostate cancer are also seen in different populations around the world. there is some evidence that dietary factors are involved such as vitamin e and selenium which may have a protective effect. genetic factors also appear to play a role particularly for families in which the diagnosis is made in men under age 60. the risk of prostate cancer rises with the number of close relatives who have the disease.	who is at risk for prostate cancer?

you seem concerned by the impending break up with your boyfriend after the relationship had gone bad to worse over the last few months. you have also made a mention of your boyfriend saying that he is not a normal person mentally. you need to arrange a psychiatric consultation for your boyfriend to find out what is mentally wrong with him. if both of you love each other and there is no one for whom he might have developed a liking then getting adequate help for him for a possible depression can help ease the situation and save a relationship from breaking up. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.	last few months our relationship does not going better my boyfriend's behave become very much rough he all time avoid me doesn't receive my call not replying my sms doesn't want to met me. when i ask reason he say that he is in mental pressure. but tell me that he loves me. i'm confused. when he is not in pressure then also avoid me saying he is busy. but in date he is normal want to kiss me or other. last two days he wanted to break up with me saying that he is not a normal parson mentally. he say that he just want no misunderstanding so wanna break up with me. i can't live without him. sad what can i do?
overwashing or the use of astringents that are too harsh will further increase oil production. make sure that your astringents are non-drying and paraben- and alcohol-free. also your moisturizer should be non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging). use moisturizers that are derived from natural oils such as almond or avocado oils.	i am a 35-year-old female whose face has become extremely oily. i wash my face at least twice a day what can i do? . i use makeup specifically for oily skin types. i use an astringent and i moisturize. after i wash my face it's like an oil pool again within 30 minutes.

that would be a reasonable course of action. sinusitis can be a bit tricky to treat and often one course of antibiotics may not do it. in light of the fact that you are still having facial pain (and pressure? ) and are still congested and coughing you may need further care -- perhaps a stronger or different antibiotic (assuming you had an antibiotic the first round) and something more to control your symptoms.	i was just treated for a sinus infection but still feel bad- do i head back to the doc? . i finished all the medication as prescribed but am still congested coughing and have face pain

most helpful answer you body needs about 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight (i do not know what you currently weigh). if you eat less and burn more you will lose weight. in a chronic situation where you are losing weight your body will attempt to lower your metabolic rate to compensate for this slowing down you weight loss. in addition to calories you body needs a balance of protein (more for men; less for women) fat and carbohydrates to achieve optimum health. i don't know your sex or what your goals are but it may be best to seek the counseling of a good nutritionist.	is it possible to have too few calories in a day? . the webmd food and fitness planner suggests that for my current weight and my weight loss target i should be consuming 1880 calories per day and burning 250 leaving a total of 1630. many days i consume less than 1880 and burn lots more than 250. is this bad for me as my body isn't getting the difference of 1630 calories at the end of each day? . for example today i consumed only 1190 and burnt 608 leaving my body short of 1048 based on the chart.

influenza ( flu ) usually comes on suddenly. in many cases people can pinpoint the hour when symptoms started. symptoms develop 1 to 4 days after you are infected and they include: fever which lasts for about 3 days. fever is usually slightly lower on the 2nd and 3rd days but may last up to 8 days. cough runny nose and sore throat which become more noticeable as fever and other symptoms decrease. these symptoms usually last 3 to 4 days after the fever goes down. a dry hacking cough may linger for up to 10 days after other symptoms are gone. complete recovery may take 1 to 2 weeks or longer. fatigue and weakness can last for several weeks. complications of influenza may develop in anyone but they are much more likely in older adults and people who have other health problems especially heart and lung diseases. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get influenza?
don’t give up! although you may not be able to exercise for long now you should expect to see less shortness of breath and better cardiovascular endurance the longer you stay consistent with your exercise routine. be sure that you’re not trying to do too much with your exercise. it may be best to start out with a low intensity level of exercise and expanding upon it as tolerated. it may not seem like a lot at first but you can slowly and gradually build up the duration and intensity of your exercise the more that you are able to adhere to it. remember your exercise doesn’t have to be done all in one session. divide it up and takes breaks to rest and recover if you need to and then pick it back up later. you may be able to continually shorten the amount of rest that you take in between sessions to eventually spend more time in a single session. also try building in more opportunities to incorporate more physically activity within your daily routine. try taking the stairs instead of the elevator or park further away. making a habit out of incorporating small opportunities like these can ultimately lead to becoming better conditioned for exercise. if exercise remains to be too difficult i’d still encourage you to continue to do what you can but i’d suggest placing more of an emphasis on your nutrition to lose enough weight until you’re at the point that you can exercise more comfortably. keep up the great work! remember to always consult your doctor before beginning an exercise routine or weight loss plan.	im 314lbs and trying to lose weight. i cant excercise 2 min before im gasping for air. how can i get a work out in?
under the law there is financial assistance to help make the cost of coverage more affordable. people with very low incomes in states that expanded their medicaid programs may qualify for low or no cost coverage through that program. people with incomes below about $46 000 per year qualify for tax credits to lower the cost of insurance premiums. the lower your income the more help you'll get. in addition if you earn less than roughly $29 000 you may qualify for reduced cost-sharing. that means you'll pay less when you go for medical care. you should log onto healthcare. gov right away. you'll be able to plug in your income information and learn if you qualify for financial assistance. open enrollment closes this sunday february 15th so you need to act now to get health insurance for 2015. once open enrollment closes you won't have a chance to buy insurance for the remainder of the year.	what if i dont qualify for medicade but also have low income

ibuprofen is used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headache dental pain menstrual cramps muscle aches or arthritis. it is also used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it works by blocking your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation. this effect helps to decrease swelling pain or fever. if you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain. this form of ibuprofen is intended for use in children. do not give this medication to a child younger than 2 years unless directed by the doctor. check the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. the manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. also products with similar names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes. taking the wrong product could harm you.	what conditions does childs ibuprofen treat?
hi day14 is the most spoke about day for ovulation and depending where you read on all lengths of cycles so if you work from day 1 you need to have unprotected sex around day 9 or 10 this gives sperm time to get in place which takes 3 days and then can live for 5 to 10 days also depending were you read take into account day 14 its give or take a day so perhaps if its a day or two after then his sperm is sitting there just waiting for action. but as long as your now pregnant unless you need to work out who the father is? can you work it out from what's above and you would need to know what days you had unprotected sex on these are the most important days any sex before day 14 is where you need to be looking. hope this helps you. good luck	"regarding an ultrasound what is the 0 day? the date that the egg was released or fertilized by the sperm? . i've received two different due dates during the earlier part of my pregnancy. per the ovluation calendar my last menstrual cycle was 32days from the previous cycle. first i was told i was ""x"" amount of weeks and 0 days and i was told i was ""x"" amount of weeks and 4 days? i'm trying to figure out on what day i possibly conceived?"
i have gone through your query and can understand your health concern. the allergic reaction can be due to amoxicillin only because acetaminophen and codeine will not cause any allergic reaction. i suggest you to stop amoxicillin. you can use any of the cephalosporin instead of amoxicillin. for allergic reaction i suggest some antihistamine drug twice daily for three days. amoxicillin and other drugs of this group are very common to cause allergic reactions. as you have mentioned that you never developed such reaction in the past and this is the first time i tell you that it can happen. i suggest you not to take amoxicillin in the future. for further information consult an allergy specialist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,Yesterday, I had my wisdom tooth extracted. I received a prescription for Tylenol 3 (equivalent to Acetaminophen 300 mg and Codeine 30 mg) for pain and Amoxicillin (500 mg) to prevent infection. I immediately took one Amoxicillin as I walked out of the dental office and for the rest of the day I had no reaction. Later just before going to sleep I took one Amoxicillin along with one Tylenol 3. The next day I woke up with an anaphylactic reaction to the groin and inner thighs. I am trying to diagnose whether it was due to Tylenol 3, the Amoxicillin or may be due to the combination. As there was not that much pain I have decided to halt the use of Tylenol 3 and I am waiting to see if the reaction resolves. However, I do know that many people are allergic to this family of antibiotics. I am wondering if this may be the case for me as well, but I have never had an allergic reaction before. I am sure that I have taken this family of antibiotics previously, though I am not certain.

no there are not over-the-counter alternatives. adderall is a highly-abused drug that is often diverted sold or given to others so my skeptical eyebrows tend to raise when someone states that inadvertently threw it away. those of us in the medical profession get stories like this all of the time and unfortunately accidents can happen. perhaps he is telling the truth but if his adderall is gone. he will not likely get another prescription until his time is due. sir i am sure everything you say is true but your answer was very non-responsive. you are correct he will not get his renewed dosage for another four weeks. i stated that in my question and it is in fact the very reason i asked the question. secondly and happily his girlfriend found the bottle in one of their christmas shopping bags this morning. they had gone to the pharmacy while running christmas errands and things got mixed up a bit. thank you.	my 25 year old son lost his adderall and can't get a replacement for 30 days. is there an over the counter alternative? . my son got his new monthly prescription two days ago and inadvertently threw the bottle away thinking the bag it was in was empty. he will not be able to get his monthly dosage until his next appointment in 30 days. is there a safe over the counter alternative he can use which at the least will help to lessen the focus and concentration issues that will inevitably arise. thank you for any guidance you can give.

when you reduce your calories to lose weight you run the risk of falling short on key nutrients. that's why choosing nutrient-rich foods is particularly important when you're dieting. fortunately some of the foods richest in nutrition -- fruits vegetables and whole grains -- also happen to be low in fat and calories. they also tend to be higher in fiber. so they help fill you up even when you're eating less to lose weight. even on the healthiest diet however you may fall short on nutrients over time. the nutrients that are most often in short supply are iron and calcium. but if you're dieting to lose weight over an extended time you may run a risk of falling short on other nutrients. taking a multivitamin can help ensure that you meet your basic needs while you try to lose weight. but remember a pill is no substitute for a healthy nutrient-rich diet. “dieting” typically entails food restriction in both the amount of food as well as the type of food that you consume both of which could potentially lead to malnourishment if done incorrectly. the good thing is that the types of food that you should be restricting on a healthy diet typically don’t offer you much nutritional value anyways which is why you would want to restrict them in the first place. you shouldn’t have to worry about nutritional deficiencies when dieting so long as you’re eating a balanced diet with a variety of different foods and as long as you’re not following a very low calorie diet. be wary however of some diet plans that severely restrict certain foods or food groups altogether. some of these diets may have varying degrees of merit but it’s best to consult with a dietitian or doctor before undergoing major dietary changes to help distinguish between helpful and harmful dietary practices.	i'm dieting to lose weight. should i worry about falling short on key nutrients?

my best advice is: rinse rinse rinse. try to rinse off as much of the chemical from your scalp as possible. experiencing a mild tingling sensation and some redness after applying hair color is not abnormal but it's possible to get a chemical burn to the scalp if you leave the solution on to long or rub it vigorously into the skin. or of course if it turns out you're allergic. if rinsing relieves the burning and redness i'd suggest you wash your hair gently with regular shampoo and apply a conditioner. the conditioner may help relieve some of the skin irritation. be sure to rinse the conditioner out of your hair after a couple of minutes. if rinsing does not relieve the burning and redness you probably should see a medical professional. hope this helps!	i seem to have had an alergic reation to hair color. my scalp is red and burning. what can i do to relieve this?

it depends on how recently you had the piercing done. so if it's within the first week or so chances are the skin might grow back together although you will still have a scar at the site. if it's longer than that chances are you will always have at least a potential space there. however if there is an infection it does need to be evaluated by a doctor and treated and the piercing may need to be removed until the infection has cleared at least.	i got my bellybutton pierced but i think it’s infected. if i take the piercing out will the skin grow back together?

nosebleeds (epistaxis) can be a sign of many different medical conditions but what you have described in your brief postings -- those specks of blood -- does not sound very serious. please keep in mind that i do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of delving into your specific case. the nasopharynx is very rich in blood supply so it does not take much for it to bleed. in the vast majority of cases this is not an ominous sign. seeing your doctor in a few weeks is fine.	at 30 i had my first-ever nose bleed. then i had another with a small amount of blood. could it be serious?

to start i highly suggest you get online at healthcare. gov to search for an insurance policy. open enrollment is now underway and only lasts until february 15th. if you haven't looked for insurance yet don't automatically assume it will be too costly. the law provides fairly generous subsidies for people with low and mid-level incomes and depending on where you live and your income you may even qualify for free or very low-cost coverage. be sure when you shop to carefully review the list of services and medications the plans cover and how much of the cost you'll be expected to pay. otherwise you might check with an organization such as needymeds. org to get help covering the cost of medicine. good luck.	i have been taking maxide 25mg for the past 7 years. i dont have insurance anymore and my meds ran out what happens now?

obviously i can't specifically answer that question since i do not know anything about your daughter's medical history. not even her current age. my advice is to work closely with an ent specialist to solve this issue. he may need to sample the fluid in her middle ear to culture it (called a tympanocentesis) or she may need the benefits of having tubes placed in her eardrums. mrsa can make it into the middle ear but this would be uncommon. all of these diagnostic and treatment efforts should reduce the frequency of her ear infections and preserve her precious hearing.	how come my daughter's ear infection wont go away when she was a premie she has mrsa could it be back

at 10 months the fusion should be doing quite well under most circumstances. also a spinal fusion today usually involves a permanent spacer that's screwed to the vertebrae and this is very durable. however certain groups (like smokers or those who take certain medications) may have slower-healing fusions than others. if you're concerned that you injured your fusion you'd be wise to call your surgeon's office for an appointment or at least to speak to the nurse or physician assistant by phone. hope this helps!	i have had a multi-level spinal fusion done 10 months ago is it possible to damage the fusion or is it muscle strain
this is a real problem. when a patient gets pregnant with an iud in we try and remove it as quickly as possible. when we are not able to remove it there is not much else to do but to cross our fingers and pray that everything will go well. the biggest risk is preterm labor premature rupture of the membranes infection all that lead to pregnancy loss. this is not to say that all patients will have this happen but it certainly is a higher risk. we do not try and remove it once the pregnancy is well on its way as this may make things worse.	what are the risks and options if you get pregnant with an iud?
your doctor will diagnose psoriatic arthritis based on a physical exam patient history family history and lab tests. while there is no specific lab test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis blood tests from some patients may reveal mild anemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate or esr) is a test that gives a rough index of inflammation. the sed rate is not specific and can be elevated with many other conditions such as other autoimmune syndromes infection tumor liver disease or pregnancy. your doctor may do other blood tests such as rheumatoid factor to help exclude the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. rheumatoid factor is a blood test that is positive in 70% to 80% of those with rheumatoid arthritis. however this test may be positive in healthy people and negative in people with rheumatoid arthritis so it is not conclusive. when one or two large joints (such as knees) are inflamed arthrocentesis can be performed. arthrocentesis is an office procedure in which a sterile needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) fluid from the inflamed joints. the fluid is then analyzed for infection gout crystals and other inflammatory conditions. x-rays may show changes of cartilage or bone injury indicative of arthritis of the spine sacroiliac joints and/or joints of the hands. typical x-ray findings include bony erosions resulting from arthritis. magnetic resonance imaging tests (mri) may also be used to detect joint and tissue inflammation. the blood test for the genetic marker hla-b27 can be found in more than 50% of patients with psoriatic arthritis who have spine inflammation. because psoriatic arthritis may lead to bone loss a bone density scan may be taken to measure bone strength and to assess which patients may be at risk for osteoporosis and fractures.	how is psoriatic arthritis diagnosed?
please don't pop it yourself. your skin is designed to protect itself and will stretch as much as possible in order to keep bacteria from entering a wound in the skin. allow the lesion to progress as it chooses. keep the area clean and dry and if it does pop cleanse the area with hydrogen peroxide and cover it with a clean and dry bandage to protect the area until it begins to heal. as always watch for signs of infection.	my bug bite is now a blister. how should i treat it?

so most people are like michael what could taste possibly have to do with sleep? well from that standpoint what i like to talk to people about is what do you eat before bed if you do eat before bed. so a lot of people they get home from work it’s 8:30 they get the kids to bed and then they are finally sitting down to a meal at 8:30 9:00 at night and then they are going to bed in a couple of hours. the body was not meant to digest lying down. so what ends up happening is that we have a high proclivity for reflux if you’ve eaten and then go ahead and lie down. now we all know a lot about reflux we’ve seen it in the news and there are a lot of medications out there for it but one of the easiest things to do is looking at what it is you’ve put in your body to avoid reflux and then not lying down right after the meal. also there are different foods out there that may or may not have some effect on a person’s ability to fall asleep. things you want to watch out for are sodas before bed because they may have caffeine content as well as the carbonation can give you gas and make you not feel so great when you’re lying down. now caffeine in and of itself i’m not i don’t have a problem with. i love a good cup of coffee and i know most people do. so i don’t really have a problem with it but what i want people to do is use caffeine responsibility and know and understand that if you’re not having a good night’s rest caffeine may be one of the culprits.	how can taste impact the quality of my sleep?
"it is very difficult for me to comment on your case since i do not know any of the details including the reason for the antibitoics in the first place. not all ""swollen glands"" are bacterial so if you a a viral infection they would not help (no matter what antibiotic you chose) if you are getting worse it is up to your doctor to run some additional diagnostic test. i think this would be better than just throwing another (a 4th) antibiotic at it without really knowing if the underlying reason justifies it."	i have sore swollen glands and neck stiffness that is not responding to 3 antibiotic treatments in a row. no fever? . hello . i've had swollen glands and a stiff neck for going on week 4 now. my gp who is also an endocrinologist had me take zpack. it responded a little to the zpack but then it stopped so he had me take another one. when that didn't work he had me take augmentin. and i seem to be getting a little worse. i'm pretty worried. i do have hypothyroid but i was recently checked and all is well there plus the swelling is in the glands in my neck and not where my thyroid would be. no fever.

"premenstrual yeast infections are fairly common. the timing has been attributed to either a slight blunting of immune function at this time in the cycle or ph changes. (menstrual flow is alkaline and the good vaginal bacterias prefer a more acidic environment. ) yet in your specific case you mention using both an over the counter treatment (hopefully one with a truly active ingredient such as miconazole or clotrimazole) and prescription difulcan tablets. frequent/recurrent yeast infections that do not respond to any of the prescribed treatments suggest a couple of possibilities. first that yeast is not the culprit or second that it is one of the atypical subtypes of yeast (""candida""). the easiest way to help unravel this question is to have the gyn do a yeast culture the next time you have symptoms. if the culture is negative then yeast is not the cause. some other conditions which can produce yeast type symptoms include: 1. cytolytic vaginitis--this is an overgrowth of the beneficial hydrogen peroxide producing lactobacili that help keep the vagina clear of undesirable bacteria. an overgrowth can produce an itchy burning irritating discharge. 2. lichen sclerosus--this is a skin condition outside the vagina (usually between the vaginal opening and the anus) that can create intense itching and irritation. 3. contact dermatitis--this would be from a change in tampons/pads new bubble bath etc. if the yeast culture is positive then the lab can identify which of the yeast subtypes may be the villain. most yeast medications are developed for candida albicans --about 80% of yeast infections are due to this. the other 20% or so are uncommon subtypes (e. g. candid glabrata). to treat the less common subtypes clinicians may try boric acid vaginally or even painting with a gentian violet (very messy! ). if these are truly reoccurances of candida albicans you might need repeat or prolonged treatments. a blood sugar or hemoglobin a 1c test can be considered. if you have ever had someone give you oral sex (or you use saliva for masturbation) you may be getting exposure to yeast. yeast is present in the gut from the mouth to the rectum. you can certainly try the so called lifestyle treatments for yeast. additional lifestyle methods which have been advocated for ""yeast infection prevention "" include: a diet low in refined sugars and simple carbohydrates avoidance of tight jeans use of cotton underwear eating natural lactobacillus yogurt and others. there are few if any good research studies which demonstrate that these methods are helpful but some women swear by them. bottom line although it's more expensive a yeast/candida culture may help find a diagnosis and direct treatment if this pattern persists. hi if you live near the sea try swimming at times your having a yeast problem if not just simple get some sea salt sprinkle some into a warm bath when its dissolved just get into it at let it do its work let the water get inside you you can google yeast infection sea salt bath lots of info. good luck omg! i have been battling the same problem for years and just this last month i think i found the cure i started a whole 30 clean eating challenge with the group at my gym and this is the first time i do not get one! i urge you guys to try this food challenge. it really all comes down to what we eat and how this is playing a roll with our hormones. hope this helps someone!"	i’ve gotten a yeast infection just before my period for 2 months. i used an otc treatment and diflucan. what can i do?
"medicare services covered by both medicare and medicaid are paid for first by medicare with medicaid filling in the difference (up to the limits of you stat'es coverage). when it comes to skilled nursing care medicare will pay after a 3-day stay in the hospital and then only up to 100 days. after that medicaid pays. typically medicaid helps to cover the cost of any out-of-pocket expenses that most medicare recipients pay toward their skilled nursing care after hospitalization. for more assistance with your particular situation i recommend you contact your state health insurance counseling and assistance program (ship) at medicare. gov or 1-800-medicare. you have really asked a loaded question. this question can be answered based only on a situational basis (i. e. has the resident been in the facility without a hospital visit and medicaid is now paying the expenses incurred? ) if this is the case medicaid will pay to hold the bed for the resident for a maximum of 14 days (in ky) after which the cost of the hold (if they choose to hold the bed) must be paid by the resident or the resident's ""responsible party"". this is the easiest scenario to understand. to get details particular to your state and situation you may visit a website: www. itcombudsman. org. this will list for you each state the type of leave the bed reservation policy the amount paid by medicaid and the date of the most recent policy. the listing is extremely easy to understand. i hope this has been helpful."	who pays for medicaid bed hold. in a skilled nursing facility with a person receiving both medicare and medicaid who pays for bed hold days when you are hospitalized? is the patient responsible?

vaccination is the primary method for control of influenza; however antiviral agents have a role in the prevention and treatment of mainly influenza type a infection. regardless antiviral agents should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for vaccination. as of dec. 15 2010 the cdc published the following concerning antiviral medications: antiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza. influenza antiviral prescription drugs can be used to treat influenza or to prevent influenza. two fda-approved influenza antiviral medications are recommended for use in the united states during the 2010-2011 influenza season: oseltamivir (tamiflu) and zanamivir (relenza). oseltamivir and zanamivir are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza a and b viruses. antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe complicated or progressive illness or who are hospitalized. antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are at higher risk for influenza complications based on their age and/or medical conditions; clinical judgment should be an important component of outpatient treatment decisions. antiviral medications currently recommended include oseltamivir and zanamivir based upon recent viral surveillance and resistance data indicating that >99% of currently circulating influenza virus strains are sensitive to these medications. amantadine (symmetrel) and rimantadine (flumadine) should not be used because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza a viruses. oseltamivir should be used to provide treatment or chemoprophylaxis (prevention of the flu after exposure to the virus) for infants younger than 1 year of age when indicated. antiviral treatment can be considered for any previously healthy non-high-risk symptomatic outpatient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is not in the recommended groups based upon clinical judgment if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. because antiviral resistance patterns may change over time clinicians should monitor local antiviral resistance surveillance data.	do antiviral agents protect people from the flu?
"the key statement in your question is this: ""one thing that worries me. "" any time you are experiencing a health condition that worries you it's a good enough reason to consult a medical professional. usually shaving or waxing can produce bumps so the fact your lesion is concave (caves inward) could indicate there's something else going on. the only way to tell for sure is to have a physical examination by a health care provider. he or she can either set your mind at ease or diagnose the problem to get you prompt treatment. i hope this helps!"	cyst like structure under follicle in groin area. hard and caves inward. should i worry? . i have noticed a cyst like thing in the crease of my thigh and groin area. when i first noticed it it was small and i just assumed it was an ingrown hair because i do shave. however it has grown and is somewhat worrying me. i'm not sure how to explain it but it feels like it is going up a vein or something. there is no pain or anything but one thing that worries me is that it causes the follicles that it is under to cave inward. could something be wrong?

catastrophic plans are plans under which an individual pays the vast majority of out-of-pocket expenses until he/she reaches the plan's deductible. some pros of catastrophic coverage are: catastrophic plans offer more affordable monthly premiums for an individual who might otherwise not purchase insurance coverage at all coverage under such a plan as suggested by its name will at least protect them in the event of a catastrophic event such as a car accident or serious illness that could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills which would plunge many people into bankruptcy the major con of catastrophic coverage is that it covers very few out-of-pocket expenses before the deductible is met and the deductibles under these plans can be quite high. so these plans may not be ideal for individuals who have substantial out-of-pocket expenses. this would include those who take a significant number of prescription drugs on a regular basis and/or find themselves visiting a physician frequently.	what are some of the pros and cons of buying a catastrophic plan?

the short answer is: no it's not safe. no one should adjust their doses of prescription drugs without consulting a doctor. in your case you're taking one anti-anxiety medication and one antidepressant. you should not adjust the dosage of either of these medications without checking with your doctor first. if you feel the prozac (fluoxetine) is not helping your depression i'd suggest you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. he or she may want to change your antidepressant medication to something else. there are plenty of antidepressants to choose from. i wish you all the best!	i am currently taking 1mg of klonopin twice a day & i would like to increase my 20mg prozac to twice a day. is this safe

the most common side effect of this treatment is what you are experiencing namely burning and irritation. assuming you have used this agent properly the cure rate is higher than some other methods. the chemical podophyllotoxin causes necrosis and destruction of the condyloma and a bit of the surrounding healthy tissue. this can appear burned white or even black. this is expected. soon this damaged tissue will heal and you should be returning to normal but you will need to be carefully examined again since some of the smaller condyloma may have escaped destruction and will also need carefully treated.	can you help with condylox genital warts treatment and side effects? . hi i have used the treatment for the 3days twice a day and now it is sore swollen the skin in white with little open skin marks where warts used to be. also it is a little smelly. is this normal? . the warts appear to have gone but i can't even wipe myself properly once been to the toilet although it doesnt hurt when i do go. i hope you can help.
several things could be causing this--sometimes the head position when you are on the mri scan table puts stress on the neck causing neck pain (patients have complained to me about this). there are 2 nerves in the back of the head called the greater occipital nerves. these nerves can be compressed when your head is laying on a hard surface and cause fairly severe pain as well. there are not any serious problems inside the head (like brain problems) that would cause this. the magnetic field from the mri scan is not strong enough to directly influence the brain or pain fibers. if dye is involved you could be allergic to it!	what could be causing severe pain in the back of my head when i get an mri?

arthritis of the knee is an inflammatory disorder of the knee joint that is often painful. arthritis has many causes. osteoarthritis (oa) is caused by degeneration of cartilage in the knee. in its extreme form the menisci (cartilage) will be completely eroded and the femur will rub on the tibia bone on bone. osteoarthritis causes a chronically painful knee that is often more painful with activity. treatment is aimed at pain control with over-the-counter pain relievers. anti-inflammatory medications either over-the-counter or by your doctor's prescription are also quite helpful. more severe oa can be treated with narcotic pain medicines or a knee joint replacement in which a synthetic joint replaces your knee joint.	what is osteoarthritis of the knee and how is it treated?

for acne take a course of tablet azithromycin 500 mg daily on three consecutive days in a week for four to six weeks and continue with benzoyl peroxide 2. 5 percent gel on the pimples in the morning and adapalene gel at night on the pimples. as far as scars are concerned you can try using tretinoin 0. 05 percent cream on the scars at night. it will not have significant benefit but you can give it a try. otherwise you can consider going for laser treatment microneedling sessions or surgical correction for the scars. besides this avoid oiling of scalp keep your face dry avoid using creams and moisturizers and reduce the intake of sugary foods. for breast changes and lump i would recommend you to consult a surgeon as he will be able to guide you better regarding these symptoms. for dandruff use a ketoconazole shampoo every alternate day to start with and then taper slowly once improvement is seen. along with this use a good quality conditioner after hair wash and start with tablet keraglo eva (gamma lenolenic acid) once daily for hair fall. this needs to be continued for a minimum of three to four months. for back pain consult an orthopedician and for allergy consult an ent specialist. baking soda and lemon juice will not have any effect on acne scars. so you can stop using them. dairy products are known to aggravate acne so reduce their intake. i do not think the burning sensation is due to acne scars. you should go for la shield sunscreen gel over your entire face at intervals of three to four hours during the daytime. for further information consult a dermatologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am 24 years old. My weight is 50 kg and my height is 158 cm. I have severe acne scars on face, back, lower back, below the neck and pimples on face. Even after using Benzoyl peroxide there is no change. I have oily skin. I use to get severe menstrual pain up to 3 or 4 days and for which I am using Meftal spas. I have breast pain mostly except the period days and few days following. Also there is a small color difference in the right breast not overall. But, the pain is not specific to this area. I get pain in both breasts. Is it just premenstrual pain or something to be concerned?For allergy, I am using nasal spray and Allegra tablet. Back pain is present occasionally and not severe. I have hair fall and thinning of hair from scalp and dandruff problem. When I oil my hair for dryness I get more pimples. What else can I do for dry hair, hair fall and dandruff? Occasionally, I get a lump below the lower abdomen on the right side. A doctor once made me cough and tested, the lump was not formed. But, he said with symptoms it would be hernia. It follows with a mild pain there. Also, at times I feel like I have to give pressure while urinating.Will these be a symptom for PCOS or endometriosis or any hormonal imbalance? What are the ways to help remove acne scars? Is baking soda a good choice? Or any other home remedy? I apply lemon juice on face, even baking soda, but nothing is working for the scars. I drink milk twice a day mixing Amul pro whey protein powder. Does dairy product cause acne? At times I get a burning sensation on body, especially after afternoon sleep, and also at the back of neck when my hair touches. Is that due to severe back acne scars? How can I take care of the diet for the problems concerned? Can you suggest me a good sunscreen for my skin?
most helpful answer has your brother seen a medical professional for the symptoms you describe? he obviously was diagnosed with an enlarged spleen and fatty liver disease but has he been seen for the vomiting and weight loss? if your brother vomits up everything he eats or drinks he's at serious risk for dehydration. you shouldn't allow vomiting to go unchecked for any period of time. unfortunately a forum like this isn't a place to receive a diagnosis. it's impossible to tell what's going on with your brother without doing a physical examination and possibly some lab tests. could the vomiting burping loss of appetite and weight loss be related to the enlarged spleen? probably not. could they be related to the liver problems? maybe. or they could indicate some other illness or disease entirely. your brother needs to see a doctor to find out for sure. any time a person is experiencing symptoms like unexplained weight loss we get a little concerned. it could be something minor or it could be something serious. there's no way to tell without a physical exam. wishing you well! these all symptoms may be due to liver disease. for the clarification of spleen involvement get his blood tested for complete blood count. you need to see an expert who may examine your brother and provide proper diagnosis.	is this dangerous and what disease is this is? . my brother is suffering really bad. he got an enlarged spleen and an enlarged liver fatty liver. excessive colonic gases they are not really enlarged kind of mild. he suffers from the following:. vomiting after eating or drinking anything. vomiting solids food is not digested. it takes him 5-10 minutes after eating/drinking to throw up. burping before vomiting. nausea. loss of appetite. weight loss. what do you think that is? i need an expert to answer me. is it really something dangerous?

hi here is some info from the uks daily mails doctor. your concern that it might have affected your fertility is a valid one and needs to be checked out if you don't fall pregnant soon. chlamydia infection can affect the fallopian tubes in a couple of ways. it might lead to the formation of scar tissue in the pelvis which physically blocks the tubes either by kinking or binding the tube down. the infection may also damage the fine hairs which line the inside of the tube and ensure the egg moves down to the uterus. depending on the contraception you used previously it can take a few months for regular ovulation to start up again so you may not have been actually able to fall pregnant for as long as a year. why not discuss this with your gp? he or she would be able to make the appropriate referral to get your tubes checked and start the ball rolling if you don't fall pregnant soon. ok looking at that it would be a good idea to see your doctor and get some tests done. you can get tests done on your tubes they can go in for a looksee who knows your tubes could be blocked that's just a thought. hope you find away. good luck	hello im a 27 yr old woman and i got an iud (mirena) in 2009. i then slept with some one and caught chlamidia in 2010. i also caught hpv when i caught the chlamidia. what i am concerned about is it had to be immediately removed due to the sti. i started hemorrhaging. i was wondering if this could decrease the likely hood of conceiving a child? me and my husband have been trying for about 3 years to get pregnant and we even keep track of my period and ovulation schedule. also what other medical side effects could i be facing? so would anybody maybe know the statistical % of me still being able to get pregnant?
if you fall asleep before your head hits the pillow that’s not a good sign. that means you’re sleep deprived okay. if you fall asleep in less than 5 minutes on a regular basis you probably need more sleep. if you fall asleep while driving that’s a big danger zone factor a big red flag that you’re going to want to understand a little bit more about. driving a car and operating a vehicle and while it may seem very rote and may seem very easy to do if you notice yourself moving over lanes not being able to stay in the lane as you normally would that’s going to be a definite sign of sleep deprivation. if you’re not thinking as clearly you’re not making the decisions that you would normally make as quickly that’s going to be a sign of sleep deprivation. and just overall movement your reaction time slows down with sleep deprivation your cognition time slows down. believe it or not even your creativity slows down with sleep deprivation. so if you’re at work and you’re trying to answer to a big problem or trying to understand what’s going on and you’re just not clicking you’re not finding the words you’re not doing the right thing or what you would normally do it could be a sign of sleep deprivation.	how can i tell if i’m sleep deprived?

"yes. anxiety and/or depression would be a normal human response to knowing that you have an ""uncurable severe illness"". treating the anxiety is just as important as trying to treat the illness. i have two types of multiple sclerosis. have had it since i was 16. it is very normal to have anxiety. don't let it overcome you though. take charge as much as can handle and don't hesitate to ask for help. good luck i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group 60-100 (just celebrated a 101sst birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease."	is it normal for a patient to have anxiety when having an uncurable severe illness?
psoriatic arthritis frequently involves inflammation of the knees ankles and joints in the feet and hands. usually only a few joints are inflamed at a time. the inflamed joints become painful swollen hot and red. sometimes joint inflammation in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit giving them the appearance of a sausage. joint stiffness is common and is typically worse early in the morning. less commonly psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion mimicking the pattern seen in rheumatoid arthritis. psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the sacrum causing pain and stiffness in the low back buttocks neck and upper back. in about 50% of those with spondylitis the genetic marker hla-b27 can be found. in rare instances psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. a very destructive form of arthritis called mutilans can cause rapid damage to the joints of the hands and feet and loss of their function. fortunately this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis. patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and around cartilage. this inflammation may lead to an enthesopathy which is inflammation of a tendon at the site where it inserts into the bone. inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes achilles tendinitis leading to pain with walking and climbing stairs. inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause chest pain as seen in costochondritis.	what are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?

"sun damage and smoking are the no. 1 reasons for premature aging or wrinkling of the skin. therefore you should incorporate the use of sunblock in your daily skin-care regimen. next utilize a daily skin regimen that exfoliates your skin which will help remove dead skin cells. this should be followed by a non-comedogenic moisturizer that contains vitamins (c & e) and rebuilds peptides for your skin. use a very dramatic moisturizer! i use multiple moisturizers and it seriously takes away my laugh lines and wrinkles. and i smile all the time. try using moisturizers that are for dry skin. i use several natural oatmeal moistorizers that work and i use a heavy body butter around the area that i have most trouble with and a gentle baby lotion for the areas i dont have trouble with. you can also use natural exfoliators i have noticed they work so much better than commercial ones! try baking soda and water apply to face keep it on for a minute or two (never longer than 3 min because of the result of skin irritation) grab a rag and put cool water on it and gently wipe it off. sometimes if it doesn't all come off and you can still feel the particles on your face then i put my face under the faucet. you can do it however you want though but you can instantly tell the difference between your first try! don't stop smiling! our body is like a computer. garbage in garbage out. i highly recommend that you look at your diet. are you eating a lot of processed foods? there is not much nutrition in processed foods if any. in my opinion even organic processed food is garbage. once something has been processed it is dead food. are you eating fresh fruits and vegetables (preferably organic so your immune system can heal your skin and does not have to fight all the chemicals in conventional foods)? raw unprocessed nuts? eggs (yes they are really good for you! ) stay away from conventional meats and dairy? it is truly true. you are what you eat! make it an adventure to discover real food not stuff that comes from a box. you will see your skin become as it should be at your age luminous and supple. granted it takes a little effort but once you see the results in your skin (and you will) you gladly eat at home and make it a home cooked meal. highly recommend you study up on healthy nutrition maybe take a cooking course. i am 64 and almost wrinkle free my weight is normal and i can pass for 50. that is what good nutrition can do for you. my best wishes to you r. d. externally there are topical line relaxers the most effective target just the line you want to treat. the line fillers are meant to ""fill in"" your lines but don't seem to work too well for me. i think regular consistent care of the skin is the most important thing you can do. routinely moisturize your skin twice a day face and neck. shower and then follow with a good thick moisturizer that has vitamins c e a with hyaluronic acid and sunscreen. avoid products with alcohol as an ingredient as this will dry and damage new skin. clean skin at night and use a good night cream. personally i love the olay refinishing night cream makes skin so soft and smells great. internally drink water and eat your berries & veggies. take a b vitamin complex with biotin fish oil and a multivitamin. if your lines don't respond to a line relaxer and twice daily tlc a precription for retinol may do the trick. i personally find these creams effective: strivectin lift cream really lifts! the newest neutrogena tone improving moisturizer is a nice effective cream that brightens skin well the olay refinishing line helps with surface problems such as large pores. i also use vitamin e oil and collagen(absorbed through skin) about once a week after a shower on wet skin. allover. then of course there's always botox."	i'm 24 but laugh lines and forehead wrinkles are already apparent on my face. can i slow them down?

"the source of this non-menstrual bleeding needs to be discovered. unfortunately this will take a careful examination by your medical provider. this pelvic/rectal area is rich in blood supply so minor trauma infections etc. all can result in bleeding. many women ""spot"" during non-menstrual times so even though you may not think it is vaginal it still could be. inserting a tampon would determine if it was spotting. if not the blood is coming from another source."	i am a bleeding from my vaginal area i had my period a week ago it does not seem to be comng from my actual vagina. i know that is not coming from my actual vagina. my question is would there be another reason for it and should i be concerned?

most helpful answer no. if there were everyone would be eating them. there has always been rumors about raw oysters one of my favorite foods. i ate a dozen one time and only about four of them worked (just kidding. an old joke). people have claimed that ginseng and other herbs have the potential to enhance sexual performance but so far any studies have only been anecdotal and pure lies. the biggest turn on to the opposite sex is not the food we eat but rather how we act and how well we treat them. if there are aphrodisiac foods i haven't heard of them.	foods such as oysters are rumored to be aphrodisiacs. are there any scientifically proven aphrodisiacal foods or herbs? . sounds like a case for mythbusters but they'd have to air that particular show on a premium cable channel.
falafel a middle eastern dish is high in protein and popular with vegetarians. it’s usually made from chick peas shaped into a ball and served in a pita pocket or on folded flat bread. my family members are fans too and we love getting falafel pita sandwiches at the farmer’s market in town. we are such falafel fans that i want to be able to make them at home too. they are actually easy to make ahead of time and can be used as a fun lunch entree for grown-ups and kids alike. falafel are usually deep fried but you can lighten them up by either cooking them in a nonstick frying pan with a controlled amount of canola or olive oil. or you can lightly coat the outside of the falafel balls with canola or olive oil cooking spray and bake them until nicely browned. here’s a recipe for the baked version. ingredients 1/3 cup dry bulgur wheat 15 ounce can garbanzo beans (chickpeas) drained and rinsed (about 1 1/2 cups) 1/2 cup chopped green onions 1/4 cup whole wheat flour 1 large egg higher omega-3 if available 1/4 cup loosely packed chopped parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons minced or chopped garlic 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional) 1/2 cup finely ground italian-style or plain breadcrumbs canola or olive oil cooking spray preparation 1. place bulgur in a small bowl and pour in boiling water to cover it by 2 inches. let soak for about 15 minutes. 2. in the bowl of a food processor combine 3/4 cup of the cooked bulgur (remove the bulgur from the bowl with a slotted spoon) with garbanzo beans green onions whole wheat flour egg parsley garlic cumin and red pepper flakes if desired. pulse scraping the sides of the bowl after about 5 seconds until the mixture is thick enough to form into balls. 3. place breadcrumbs in a small bowl. use a tablespoon measure to scoop a level tablespoon of falafel dough and drop it into the breadcrumbs; roll it around in the breadcrumbs to lightly coat. place the coated falafel on a sheet of waxed paper on the counter. repeat with the remaining falafel dough. cover the falafels loosely and let them stand for 1 hour. (you can skip this waiting period if you don’t have the time). 4. preheat oven to 450-degrees. while still on the waxed paper coat the tops of the falafels generously with cooking spray. lay the falafels cooking-spray-side down on a cookie sheet. spray the tops of the falafels generously with more cooking spray. 5. bake until golden brown about 22 minutes. while they are baking you can whip up a batch of tahini dressing. yield: makes about 5 servings. nutritional analysis per serving: 182 calories 9 g protein 31 g carbohydrate 3 g fat . 4 g saturated fat . 4 g monounsaturated fat . 4 g polyunsaturated fat 42 mg cholesterol 6 g fiber 464 mg sodium. calories from fat: 14 percent. omega-3 fatty acids =. 1 gram omega-6 fatty acids =. 3 gram. tahini dressing ingredients 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup tahini (sesame paste or butter) room temperature and stirred to smooth 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon minced or chopped garlic 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon tabasco sauce (optional) 2 teaspoons honey preparation 1. place all the dressing ingredients in a blender or small food processor bowl or small mixing bowl. 2. beat or pulse until well blended (it should look whipped). 3. place dressing in a bowl and serve or cover and refrigerate up to 3 days. yield: makes 1/2 cup. nutritional analysis per tablespoon: 50 calories 2 g protein 3 g carbohydrate 3. 5 g fat . 5 g saturated fat 1. 5 g monounsaturated fat 1. 5 g polyunsaturated fat 0 mg cholesterol . 4 g fiber 38 mg sodium. calories from fat: 63 percent. omega-3 fatty acids = 0 gram omega-6 fatty acids = 1. 5 grams.	is falafel good for me?

i don't necessarily think this is going to save you money. believe it or not xl and cds and things like that are actually once a day formulations which means you don't have to purchase as much of the medication for it to work for what the doctor or healthcare provider is trying to treat you. we found that a lot of people even struggle with just taking their medication once a day if you don't have this extended release formulation you have to take it two three four times a day. i found out a lot of patients forget or don't take it at all. so in the long run it actually costs you money because you are not taking your medication in the right way. you are actually going to probably get sicker and maybe go to the emergency room or visit your doctor a little bit more and in the long run healthcare cost go up. drugs are a small component of that and i think a lot of people underestimate how important it is that these extended release products are actually a benefit and worth the money.	how can avoiding medications with xl la xr or cr in their name save me money?

meet with your doctor and discuss if it's safe for you to exercise. once you've received your doctor's ok search the internet to find alternatives. if your concerns about exercise are related to a chronic illness two good places to start would be with a support group or just looking up if their are any national associations that might have some information they could share.

well this is an interesting question. i'm not sure there's a straightforward answer because i'm not sure anyone has studied this. here's what we know: smoking around infants and children can cause them to inhale second-hand smoke which may be linked to higher rates of certain lung problems like asthma. we also know second-hand smoke contains harmful chemicals and that this smoke (containing chemicals) can settle on surfaces such as clothing draperies countertops and so on. will coming in contact with this potentially toxic material on someone's shirt (or fingertips) cause problems for your baby? my guess (and it's strictly a guess! ) is probably not. if this were the case the entire baby boomer generation would probably exhibit symptoms because nearly all of our relatives smoked and held babies at the same time. you can reduce any possible risk by gently wiping off your baby with a damp cloth after he or she has been cuddled by someone you believe has tobacco smoke residue on their clothing or hands. you probably don't need to be overly aggressive about this. don't scrub the little one's skin off. but a simple swipe should do the trick. hope this helps!	can cigarettes smoke stain clothing and/or skin with chemicals or toxins harmful to a newborn baby? . i am wondering if anyone who smokes and then holds or is around my newborn can cause any harm from anything on their clothing or skin.

avoid getting active tb active tuberculosis (tb) is an infection that is spreading in a person's body and it is very contagious. the world health organization (who) estimates that one-third of the world's population is infected with the bacteria that causes tb. to avoid getting an active tb infection: do not spend long periods of time in stuffy enclosed rooms with anyone who has active tb until that person has been treated for at least 2 weeks. use protective measures such as face masks if you work in a facility that cares for people who have untreated tb. if you live with someone who has active tb help and encourage the person to follow treatment instructions. prevent latent tb from becoming active usually treatment with isoniazid for about 9 months or rifampin for 4 months can prevent a latent tb infection from developing into active tb. treatment is recommended for anyone with a skin test that shows a tb infection and is especially important for people who: are known to or are likely to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). have close contact with a person who has active tb. have a chest x-ray that suggests a tb infection and have not had a complete course of treatment. inject illegal drugs. have a medical condition or take medicines that weaken the immune system. have had a tuberculin skin test within the past 2 years that did not show a tb infection but now a new test indicates an infection. can the tb vaccine help? a tb vaccine ( bacille calmette-guerin or bcg) is used in many countries to prevent tb. but this vaccination is almost never used in the united states because: the risk of getting tb is low in the u. s. the vaccine is not effective in adults who receive it. the bcg vaccine may cause a tuberculin skin test to indicate a tb infection even if a person is not infected with tb. this complicates the use of the tuberculin skin test to check people for tb. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	how can tuberculosis tb be prevented?

probably not but it is good not to do this again if a perforated eardrum is even remotely possible.	what are the risks of using carbamide peroxide drops on a perforated eardrum? . i initially thought my symptoms might have been due to a build-up of earwax. i used otc carbamide peroxide in an attempt to clear out any possible blockage. i only used it once as it actually increased the sense of fullness in the affected ear which i assume was due to some of the fluid draining into the perforation. about a week after using the drops i was properly diagnosed with a perforated eardrum. could i have done any damage by using carbamide peroxide drops on my perforated eardrum?

you are abusing drugs and if you are caught with one of the ever-increasing sensitive tests available you will need to pay the price. beating a drug test is not the real underlying issue here my friend. the real issue is that you are abusing strong drugs (and alcohol) and will likely suffer some severe medical consequences for those decisions. is it really worth it? i can't (and won't) tell you how to circumvent a drug detection test since i don't know what kind or sensitivity of test the course is doing or how much of those substances you have locked in your cells ready to reveal your secret. i suspect you will be found out. if not now eventually. you have not changed your drug behavior and need help with your substance abuse. don't wait until it is too late mike.	someone drinks alot for 3 nights and takes 4 15mg oxycodones how long will it take to have a clean urine & etg test? . if somebody drinks heavily for 3 nights and takes four 15 milligram oxycodone how long will it take to have a clean urine sample with an etg test and a very sophisticated court drug test?

it definitely is possible to receive a false-negative result on a home pregnancy test. some things that can cause a false-negative result are not following the package directions (especially the ones that say how long to hold the dipstick in the urine) and testing diluted urine (such as if you drank a lot of water during the day you tested). testing first thing in the morning is a good idea because that's when your urine is most concentrated. your best bet at this point is to see a health care provider for a more precise pregnancy test in a medical setting. while you're waiting to do this be sure to live as if you are pregnant -- in other words eat healthy don't smoke and avoid drinking alcohol. until you know for sure you should err on the side of caution. hope this helps!	i'm 12 days late but have a negative pregnancy test. it has always been 28 days between my cycles. can i be pregnant?

"yes this can be common as it can take up to two years after the first period for the ovaries to completely mature and produce regular ovulations every month. in the early years of menstruation estrogen production is more than adequate to build up a thickened lining in the uterus. but without regular ovulations not enough progesterone is made. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone ""stabilizes"" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don't decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged and erratic bleeding--this is likely what has happened to her. another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows. simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer (causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining ) and progesterone is like the lawnmower (keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms). this is why depoprovera (high dose synthetic progesterone) brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills (relatively progesterone dominant) bring about shorter lighter periods. it is also why women who miss ovulations (no progesterone produced) are at a greater risk for too thick lining. lastly less than 10% of adolescent women with heavy menstrual bleeding have an undiagnosed blood clotting disorder. this would be more likely if she had a family history of von willebrand's syndrome. given the duration of her bleeding i would urge you to have her see either your gyn a pediatrician or your family md. a short course of hormones may be helpful in stopping this distressing bleeding pattern yes it is nothing to worry about. this could mean instead of one egg a month she produces 2. i get mine every 14 das alsoand always have and i am 22. my mom had the same thing."	my 11 year old recently started her period. she has a period every 14 days and it lasts for six days. is this normal?
"most helpful answer i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds very painful. just to be clear all pain is ""nerve pain. "" nerves transmit sensation from the body to the brain. that may be why your physician prescribed neurontin ( gabapentin ) for your pain. i'm just guessing here but perhaps the muscle injury is no longer the source of your pain. maybe the pain is now caused by nerves that have become irritated. sometimes a medication like gabapentin can calm down nerves so they stop transmitting pain signals to the brain. at any rate the fact you have no relief from the gabapentin means you need to be re-evaluated by a medical professional. it's true that people sometimes have to learn to live with a certain amount of pain. for example on the ""zero to 10"" scale some people need to learn how to live at a constant pain level of 3 or 4. but it sounds like your pain is more severe than this. for that reason you need to continue to follow up with your doctor. all patients are entitled to pain control though as i said sometimes that means pain of 3 or 4 not pain of zero. wishing you well!"	why am i given neurontin for a stretched muscle is it not for nerve pain only? . my dr told me this muscle will never heal in my shoulder blade so i must continue to do exercises to stop muscle from further damage. i do not have nerve pain so is there any other meds i can take. i was taking percocet for over a year every 4 to 6mnts. dr says now i have to learn to live with this pain and go to pain management classes. neurontin is not helping when the pain becomes severe i go to hospital or leave work when pain becomes umbearable. please help.
a carbohydrate is the chemical name for sugars and grains. carbohydrates always contain the elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen. fruits breads pasta potatoes beans cereal and rice are high in carbohydrates or “carbs. ” many vegetables are also rich in carbohydrates. soft drinks candy and most other sweet junk foods also contain highly processed carbohydrates. natural carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. the healthiest carbs are in whole grains vegetables fruits and beans. these foods are filled with other nutrients along with carbohydrates. our bodies have to work a bit to digest these carbs. processed carbohydrates such as high-fructose corn syrup are unhealthy when consumed regularly in large amounts. experts believe they are too-easily digested causing blood sugar spikes that might contribute to developing diabetes and other health problems.	what are carbohydrates?

"based on my experience over the years i think fm makes our muscles more susceptible to strains or tears/injuries within the muscles. also we seem to be more susceptible to getting tendinitis and bursitis. some of this may be due to certain deficiencies that we with fibro develop like low intracellular magnesium levels low muscle energy (atp) and low growth hormone levels that interfere with the protection flexibility and recovery of the muscles and soft tissues. our soft tissues may be more susceptible to the degenerative ""wear and tear"" changes we all get with aging and overuse. also our muscles act more ""deconditioned"" when we have fm which increases our chance of an injury. fm doesn't cause/aggravate disc disease or arthritis changes but the reverse situation is true. that is disc and arthritic disease can aggravate fm symptoms. i don't believe in automatically attributing any soft tissue problem to fm. in fact most of the times something else like a trauma or a degenerative problem is ""clearly"" identified as the direct cause of the tear or bursitis/tendinitis. but we can surmise that the fm probably played a secondary role in a lot of these situations. no i dont believe so"	can fibromyalgia cause muscles to tear more easily?

the primary benefit for reduced pap smear screening would be less over treatment -- especially in younger patients. in the 1980s i can remember young women being sent for laser destruction of cervical tissue for what we now consider to be mild dysplasia or cin 1. some of the more aggressive treatments can remove a significant amount of cervical tissue. if the removal of cervical tissue is extensive (removal of tissue can range from a few millimeters to slightly less than an inch) it can undermine the ability of the cervix to remain closed until full-term delivery. fortunately studies were done that demonstrated young women with a healthy immune system were able to clear many mild cervical cell changes on their own. this was true in about 60% of mild cases. more frequent pap smears in this group for one to two years after diagnosis would identify the small group that did not spontaneously clear.	how do the new recommendations for pap smears benefit patients?

"generally speaking most injectors won't put hyaluronic acid into the neck because it's not effective. hyaluronic acid is commonly called a ""dermal filler. "" its purpose is to add volume to the face where the fat pads have naturally shrunken over time. when you add volume to your cheeks for example it tightens the skin and reduces the appearance of the large lines around the nose. the skin of the neck can become saggy over time and it would take a lot of dermal filler to tighten up this skin. depending on how loose the skin of the neck is you might consider a laser skin treatment or a neck lift. a laser treatment can significantly tighten the skin of the neck and make the surface of the skin look soft and new. a neck lift is a surgery that usually can be done on an outpatient basis. it might sound gruesome but patients i cared for told me it wasn't very painful and they were pleased with how it looked. if you're interested in any of these procedures your best bet (in my opinion) is to consult a cosmetic surgeon. wishing you well!"	can hyaluroic acid injections be given into the neck area

hi you may need to do some research to get to the bottom of his problem. but this could be from bullying at school he's angry from what's happening to him and this could be what's behind the crying. do hope this helps you. good luck	my 13 year old son feels angry and cries in the evening sometimes and does not know why. what could cause this? . he is fine all day and then he cries in the late evening sometimes. he says he feels very angry and he has no idea why he feels this way. i have explored the possibility of low blood sugar and that may be the cause but i am wondering what other things may cause such a reaction.

"this isn't really an answer i'm just hoping that more effort will be put into finding a solution when enough people reveal that they are suffering from this affliction. it's been going on for nearly two weeks now in the same way for me as many others have described. there was no rash the first few days just itching in random alternating places for various intervals of time. the rashes are just as random in size place and duration. nothing seems to be consistent in the way of onset or relief. i hope that it either goes away or a more definitive treatment can be found. it's gotten so bad that i actually scream ""stop it"" out loud sometimes when the itching goes on for too long and becomes a significant inhibitor of whatever it is i'm attempting to do. (sleep work read exercise etc) i hope an answer can be found."	i have a itchy rash that comes and goes what could be causing this? . the rash appears in different areas of my body for an example a rash showed up on my wrist and stayed a while and went away. later the same day it appeared on my stomach and then on my thighs etc. its itchy while it is present. at one point my hands first turned red and then start to itch really bad to the point i had to wash my hands repeatedly. i work in the medical field so i wash my hands a million times a day. what could be causing this reaction?
the pertussis vaccine cannot cause disease. it is not a live vaccine. if the baby developed pertussis it was because she was exposed to someone who had the disease at a time where she was not completely protected by her vaccines.	can a mother who's gotten tdap vaccine give pertussis to 2 month old baby? . i was vaccinated for pertussis by getting the tdap shot at 32 weeks pregnant. when my newborn was 6wk old she received first dtap shot & went to daycare next week. 2 weeks in she got first head cold but after a persistant cough we tested & confirmed she's whooping cough at 11 weeks old. did i give baby whooping cough or did she get it from a daycare provider? we're starting rx today but if she returns to daycare before completingmeds she may continue to be exposed to the bacteria there.

hi for me if you was doing everything you say then you would be losing weight. but your not so your cheating its the only answer you need to as strict with what your doing as you say above do that and you will lose weight. but get on to some of these new ways of losing weight like the caveman. get out walking but brisk walking take a weighted back pack and when doing that find some hills to climb get up early go swimming these last two are some of the best ways to lose weight you just keep away from fast foods and junk foods and no sodas drink lots of water. all ways think of these self discipline. self control. breaking bad habits. in grain these in your mind. good luck	not loosing weight exercise brutally and consistently! due to a recent stressful situation i became partially bald! . i am a 27 year old male with no prior medical illnesses other than allergies and colds. i exercise frequently and more than many people i know who are fit. i have been tracking my workouts for the past 2 years and have followed a million diets. i always try to make the healthier choice when i go out to eat (not often) and drink on occasion. from august 2014 - december 2014 i ran boxed lifted weights in combination and lost little to no weight. bp is 9<negative_smiley>72 and after exercise 115/90ish
depends. if the cause of the sinus infection or respiratory problem is bacterial and the particular bacteria is felt to be medically-sensitive to this potent antibiotic than it may help. most sinus and respiratory infections are viral however and viruses do not respond to any antibiotic. it is best that you avoid self-treatment using an previously-prescribed medication or a medication that was prescribed for others. yes it will help in upper respiratory tract infections. we advise not to self medicate. better visit your doctor before starting any medication.	will cipro help with sinus infection and respitory

"to your last point about sharing razors and piercings with your friend: you should not do this. not because your friend might be infected with hiv but because it's not hygienic under any circumstances. there are many other bloodborne illnesses you could get from sharing razors needles and other items including hepatitis c. to your larger question. there probably is no way for you to know for sure what is going on with your friend. due to patient privacy laws you cannot (for example) call up her doctor and ask if she has hiv or not. it is highly unlikely that she would be prescribed complera if she did not have hiv-1. most medications can be prescribed ""off-label. "" that is doctors can use prescription medications for conditions other than the ones they were approved to treat. however it is unlikely that a medication like complera would have many off-label uses. i feel you have to err on the side of caution here. go and get an hiv test on yourself. it's a good idea to do this regularly anyway if you're sexually active or if you share needles razors or other items that can transmit viruses. wishing you well!"	can hiv meds (complera) be taken by people who don't have hiv? . my friend claims she got a false positive hiv test because her immune system is in very bad shape. she was talking about viral load (i thought that only has to do with hiv not viruses in general? ) and a high t-cell count. her doctor prescribed her hiv medication (complera) to take for the rest of her life even though she doesn't have hiv just a very bad immune system. is this even possible or is she lying? we're very close we share razors and piercings should i get tested?

my advice is just the opposite – your children should be vaccinated for seasonal and h1h1 flu. the problem with the h1n1 virus is that it is affecting healthy young adults and children. we have especially seen a number of h1n1-related deaths in children if they have asthma. that alone should tell you that this is a very serious virus and if you have access to the vaccine you and your children should get it. each year thousands of children and adults (over 35 000) die just from seasonal flu. in my mind it is better to be safe than sorry.	do my 3- and 5-year-old children really need to get the flu/h1n1 vaccines? my chiropractor strongly suggests against it.
this is a great question. so many consumers and patients are coming with these type of products to the counter and saying hey can you help me figure out if this is right for me. once again this is an over-the-counter product they are usually in the vitamin and herbal section. we have limited data on whether or not they work. we don't know what they are active ingredients sometimes are. so we want to make sure that patients are really careful about this. one of the things encountering in the diet area is the fact that people who have cardiac conditions or high blood pressure these may not be the right choices for them. once again the physician or healthcare provider needs to see this and evaluate you based on that first before we go and choose any over-the-counter supplement. people might think oh it's just something minor because i just feel like i gained a few pounds of water weight. but that can make a really big difference especially if you have high blood pressure or certain lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd all these things kind of come into play. so i really want consumers and patients to understand that we know these products are out there but we want to make sure we make the right choices and education is the best way to go. so ask a question first. and find out if it's the right product for you. they could have an adverse reaction. the other thing is too is that sometimes they contain byproducts that people that may have allergic reactions to; a filler or a salt or a particular root that they found. like a lot of them come with more natural products like leaves or roots from trees and a lot of people are starting to break out from those because they have never been exposed to them before. so once again be really careful about the choices that we are making.	are the sleeping pill fat burner combos like liponesta safe? do they work?

there are a few more questions that i would need to ask. how old is the infant and how long has the diarrhea been going on? is the child running a fever? diarrhea can be dangerous in an infant because it can cause dehydration rather quickly. infants don't know they should be drinking water and eating to help replenish essential nutrients so if this has been going on for more than a day my suggestion is to call your doctor or health care provider immediately to let them know what is going on.	when do i need to be concerned about diarrhea in an infant?
i'm sorry to hear you're coping with this. you received good advice at the time of the injury. most hematomas do get resorbed by the body over time. however a small percentage do not. instead they can become encapsulated and feel like a hard painful lump beneath the skin. it's time for you to have this hematoma re-evaluated. it's possible you're one of the unlucky few whose hematoma became encapsulated. if that's the case the usual treatment is a minor surgery to remove it. wishing you well!	hematoma due to fall(15x10x5c) had for 5 months still not reducing and beginning to hurt. what are my options? . the hematoma is high up on my right butt cheek and feels like a constant muscle pull. i had a ct scan a week after it happened and was told everything was fine it would just take a long time to reabsorb. how long should it take? is pain like this normal for this?

i don't see why not. at least from a medical perspective. there's no health reason i can think of in which milk would adversely interact with fish. many people i've known have drunk milk with fish. religious dictates may advise against combining milk with fish. i'm afraid i can't speak to that. if you have any concerns about this please consult your health care provider or your religious authority. hope this helps!	can you drink milk with fish?
your body responds to food intake with hunger and fullness. even if you eat every couple of hours if it's not enough to fill you up you will likely get hungry. i don't know of any way to trick the body. that being said it is beneficial to eat filling foods with fiber like fruits vegetables whole grains and beans. i highly recommend you see a registered dietitian to help get you on the right track. if you lose weight gradually with proper nutrition it will be better for you and much easier to maintain (the hardest part of weight loss). also a dietitian can address any other issues that may be getting in the way of a healthy lifestyle. to find a dietitian in your area go to eatright org. good luck!

twenty percent to 50% of travelers may develop diarrhea depending on the region of the world they visit. diarrhea is the most common illness of travelers. in general travelers at risk for diarrhea commonly come from industrialized nations and travel to high-risk areas that are primarily within developing or less industrialized nations of the world including latin america africa the middle east and asia. areas of lesser risk include china and some caribbean nations. travel to areas of the u. s. canada northern europe and australia pose the lowest risk to travelers. men and women are at equal risk for developing travelers' diarrhea. younger individuals are more commonly afflicted perhaps because of more adventurous eating habits. people with disorders that compromise their immune system (such as hiv cancer chemotherapy steroid use) diabetes patients and people with underlying abdominal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome colitis) are more susceptible to travelers' diarrhea. interestingly people on acid blockers for their stomachs -- such as famotidine (pepcid) cimetidine (tagamet) omeprazole (prilosec) and esomeprazole (nexium) -- also have a higher susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea because they have less stomach acid to protect them from the bacteria that cause the condition.	how common is travelers' diarrhea?

there are physicians certified in addiction medicine at county and state facilities who are able to offer assistance at very reasonable rates for residents. you can check on this via the american society of addiction medicine: www. asam. org. in addition you can also research where 12 step meetings are held and attend or call the listed number to ask for help. if you find out that you will be responsible for paying the cost of drug detox treatment and/or rehab do not let that discourage you from getting help. talk to the detox facility and/or rehab to see if they offer any discounts or scholarships. it could be you qualify for a special program. another option for covering the cost is to see if the detox center (rehab) works with a finance company or can recommend a finance company that other patients have worked with to cover the balance. sometimes this is a good option because it will allow you to spread the balance out over several months. many facilities offer a considerable discount to patients who are able to pay cash up front as well. asking all these questions could land you some nice discounts and an more affordable rate for your budget. if you find a facility that is highly recommended to you - don't be afraid to tell them how much you want to receive their service. the seemingly most inexpensive route is a government funded detox or rehab. government funded means that the program is funded by state and federal money. as for how much drug detox and/or rehab costs for these programs it is possible to pay a few hundred dollars and under and in some cases they are of no cost – depending of funding. traditional hospital detox (or rehab) may cost from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand depending on how much funding they receive from the government or outside agencies. although there are some luxury high-end private detox facilities and rehabs where the cost can start at $10 000 per day – it is also important to know that some private treatments may cost about $1 000 per day and offer some extra amenities. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	what resources are available for treating drug addiction if you don’t have insurance?
hi if like my wife you keep a little book noting down when you your periods start then you need to look about 6 to 7 weeks before that november date because your pregnancy goes from that date so it would have been 14 days after that date give or take a day. your ovulation day is day 14 after the first day your period started. so you must have had unprotected sex 3 to 7 days before that date and that's the only real way you can work it out. ok hope this helps you. good luck	i need help knowing when i conceived? . i am 37 weeks pregnant and i had an ultrasound on november 19th 2015 which said i was 5 weeks 5 days. my due date is july 16th-- can anybody tell me when i would have conceived? thank you!
most reactions to vaccines are mild and self-limited. these are usually limited pain swelling and redness at the site of the vaccination. these occur in up to 80% of individuals and start within hours of the vaccination. some people can get more generalized symptoms including fever muscle aches headache loss of appetite and feeling generally tired. these systemic (generalized) reactions are seen more commonly with live attenuated vaccines and usually occur seven to 21 days after the vaccine was given. the worst (and very uncommon) reaction is anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction). these reactions usually occur shortly after the vaccine is given and can be life-threatening. fortunately these reactions only occur two times for every million doses of vaccine given.	what reactions are likely after an immunization?

exercise has no effect on hiatal hernias. exercise however can increase acid reflux in people who are prone to acid reflux presumably those individuals with weak lower esophageal sphincter muscles. exercise increases intra-abdominal pressure and can force stomach acid back into the esophagus through a weak lower esophageal sphincter. the effects of alcohol and tobacco on the effectiveness of protonix or related drugs (proton pump inhibitors or ppis) are minimal. however both alcohol and tobacco aggravate the underlying acid-related conditions for which protonix is used and they should be discouraged.	can exercise help with a hiatal hernia and do alcohol or tobacco have any effect on (pantoprazole) protonix?

beta blockers will slow your heart rate. therefore when you're swimming or doing any kind of physical activity or exertion your heart rate will not increase much as it did when you were off the meds. it's a whole different experience. now that shouldn't stop you from doing your activities. you just cannot use the heart rate range rules to see if you're getting the caloric or fat burn you want. or if you're an athlete on a beta blocker the same holds. you can't use your heart rate to determine your overall activity efficiency or performance.	does taking beta blockers affect heart rate during exercise?
i have read and understood your problem. premature ejaculation is very common problem and is usually not associated with any disease. but may be due to anxiety and sometimes however may be problem with prostate gland and thyroid hormone. you can learn to control premature ejaculation by doing this exercise. pull your muscles that you pull at the end of urination for few seconds then release repeat this several times daily. another is stop-start technique: when you feel that you are going to ejaculate stop the sexual stimulation and divert your mind the penis will relax. after sometime start the stimulation again and repeat the procedure. over few months you will gradually increase your ejaculation time. most often it is a chronic problem; you have to take medicines in between and period off medicine. you can apply lignocaine gel to head of penis 10 minutes before sex and wipe it off before starting sex. usually medicines like dapoxetine 60 mg are given two to three hours before sex but you have to get a prescription from your doctor. best wishes. for further information consult a sexologist online --><link>	Hi doctor,I am a 34 year old male.

and last sorry could not post all this in one go? can you get pregnant from sperm outside your body? if a man ejaculates around the labia of a womans vagina the tail like whip of the sperm may guide it to the inside of a womans vagina. the mission of each sperm is to reach the unfertilized egg and it has no problem with heading in the right direction if the travel occurs quickly it can get inside where it can live up to two weeks in the womans uterus before inpregnation. no once sperm touches oxygen or air it is killed. think of it as bacteria it dies when its not at body temperature. the two answers above are both false. first of all sperm are very fragile and they are not on a mission to reach a woman's egg. truth be told experiment after experiment has shown that sperm have no sense of direction and can't swim very well. thus the reason that millions of sperm must be present and ejaculated inside a woman so that maybe a handful can reach an egg (if present). also sperm don't die when they hit the air they only die once the semen dies. if you don't know semen is the liquid you can see that contains the sperm which you can't see. if the semen is dry the sperm are dead. think about this even under perfect conditions where both people are fertile and healthy the woman is perfectly ovulating and the man ejaculates directly into her vagina the chances of pregnancy are never more than 80%. so if under perfect conditions it is still relatively difficult to get pregnant than it is nearly impossible to get pregnant in any other fashion. put it this way there has never been a case other than the birth of jesus son of mary where a virgin gets pregnant. so in the real world a man can't just ejaculate on a woman and get her pregnant the two must have sex. it is impossible to keep your virginity and get pregnant because sperm must be inside a woman for her to get pregnant and this can't happen if there is no intercourse. if a man ejaculates on a woman's stomach face breasts etc. there is no chance of pregnancy because the sperm can't just waltz into a woman's vagina. many women may say that they didn't have sex and yet got pregnant but this is not the case. knowledge is power. so there you are there all from different sites some doctors and some not but you do have to remember that sperm when ejaculated inside the vagina is there at your cervix now just add all the way it has to travel through thick mucus and then it has to break into the cervix it’s a long way to go i know its there job and add into that its only a small amount of sperm it would not be the full load? so lots to have read and think about. but why not give it a try or trial to see if can be done? but please let us know how you got on. do hope this helps you. good luck	"anyone here who knows of a pregnancy due to ejaculant on fingers being rubbed on vagina during mutual masturbation? . i've read many many replies (on many websites) from doctors regarding the chances of getting pregnant by a small amount of ejaculant on one's hands being rubbed on the vaginal opening. some say ""yes possible b/c it only takes one sperm"" while some say ""very unlikely b/c sperm need to be inserted higher"". i'd like to know: 1) is there any medical professional here who actually knows of a pregnancy happening from such a situation? 2) are there any more scientific studies on this? thanks"

i wonder if you have a torn muscle? it doesn't sound like a cramp to me. a cramp is when your muscle tenses uncontrollably and feels like it's trying to tear itself apart. if your muscle tenses it could be a cramp - in that case try hydration gentle stretching calcium and either gatorade or pickle juice.	leg cramps. i am having very sharp pain in my upper left thigh for about a week now - since my last workout. the pain is not constant it comes in waves and feels like burning for about two seconds then goes away. it's getting stronger. could this be a cramp? it's a small spot on my thigh about the size of a golf ball but very concentrated.

you could try non-weight bearing exercise like biking or swimming and low-impact exercises like the elliptical machine. if you work out at home you can purchase aerobic-training equipment like a bike or you could try some exercise videos. . also don't forget to do resistance exercise to build muscle. you lose muscle when you lose weight which can slow down your metabolic rate so you want to keep your muscle by doing resistance exercise. a trainer at your gym can design program for you. if you exercise at home you can check out exercise tubing for resistance exercise. tubing is inexpensive and versatile (you can do lots of exercises with them even in a chair) and a great way to get started with resistance exercise. you can start with a set of four for about $20. they come in colors to denote the tension. if you order them make sure to order the strap that allows you to attach the tube to a door and if you want to work your legs ask for leg straps. . you could also do exercises to strengthen your feet! the first one is to sit in a chair barefoot with the end of a towel under your toes and start to flex your toes to grab or pull the towel under your feet. you have to keep flexing your toes to pull it all the way under your feet. when you're done the entire towel should be under your feet. do a search for feet exercises and you'll get lots of ideas. .	what are some exercises that i can do that will not put strain on my feet?

i'm sorry you're going through this but i'm glad to see you're so vigilant about your breast health. way to go! first let me say breast cancer in a 16-year-old is exceedingly rare. i want to put your mind at ease about that. the problem is likely something far less serious. it wouldn't hurt to get this situation checked out by your doctor or nurse practitioner. it could be related to hormones (because of course they fluctuate) or something else that's very simple (such as circulation issues). even if the situation clears up over the next few days i'd suggest you get this looked at. you'll feel less anxious and your doctor will get the condition into your medical history in case it occurs again. wishing you well!	i have one purple nipple. it's acts weird. i am 16. just had my period and when it stopped only one nipple became very sore and part if my armpit also. the nipple was first very pink and today it was almost purple when i woke up. it has a normal shape it's not swollen. it acts completely different from tr other nipple like sometimes it's pointy and the other isn't. i'm only worried because everywhere i research it says if only one breast/ nipple has an issue it's and issue but not if it's happening to both. btw i don't have sex?
there are lot of medical issues which can occur from tattooing like hiv infection tetanus hepatitis b and c and allergic reactions. nowadays tattooists reduced such risks by following universal precautions working with single use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. as you mentioned your piercing was done only till the epidermis the infection is highly unlikely (very very less chance) that you will contact any infection. even if the needle was infected it requires contact with body fluids like blood. so you can relax. still i would like to make the following points:- in case of an hiv infection the test takes about 2-3 months to be positive. hence there is no way to find out if you got infected which is again highly unlikely. there is something called post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) given to individuals who have been exposed to the virus and includes three drugs given only under doctor's supervision. you can discuss this with your doctor. if you frequently get a tattoo done make sure your tetanus and hepatitis b vaccines are up-to-date. always have clear knowledge about the infections spread by tattooing like hiv and hepatitis and their mode of spread. take care and stay safe. for further doubts consult a hiv aids specialist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,Four days ago I visited a tattoo shop.

since you are only 20 and have no wrinkles then the best advice for you is to always wear sunblock stay out of the sun eat non-processed foods and drink 4-6 glasses of water a day. most wrinkles come from the sun. so your best anti-wrinkle cream if you don't have wrinkles is sunblock. at around 30 it does make sense to start with a nice anti-wrinkle cream. using expensive products is ok if you can afford it since they will provide good moisture and they feel good. moisturizing daily will keep the skin supple at any age. but only sun avoidance will really make a giant difference over time as far as line prevention is concerned.	i am 20. is that too young to consider anti-wrinkle night cream as a preventative?

two important things to note here are growth and hydration. if your child is growing steadily as shown on his growth chart and is having plenty of wet diapers than that is a good sign. diarrhea that results in dehydration or slowed growth is problematic. you also might want to try a formula with probiotics (good bacteria for the gut) to see if that helps. if you are still concerned ask to be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. they can perform some tests and have the appropriate experience to troubleshoot potential solutions or let you know everything is fine. trust your instincts and get the help you need!	infant runny bowel movements. my 2 month old son has had very runny bowel movements since birth. we have checked with his doctor changed his formula and still have had no changes. his bm's most often happen before he has even finished a. 5-6 oz. bottle. he also grunts a lot as if constipated. wehave gotten no answers from out dr and are very concerned.
hi if all tests done on you have come back normal then you should not be worried at all. the only thing u mentioned is a low wbc count. well wbcs are meant for maintaining our immunity and if they are low that means you have less inner strength to combat any outside infections from getting into your body. the enlarged lymph nodes seem to be a result of low immunity. build up your immunity and you should be fine thanks	I may have neutropenia or lymphdathy, need answers?

the exact cause of peyronie's disease is unknown. in people whose disease develops quickly lasts a short time and goes away without treatment the likely cause is trauma (hitting or bending) that causes bleeding inside the penis. however in some people peyronie's disease develops slowly and is severe enough to require surgical treatment. other possible causes of peyronie's disease include: vasculitis. this is an inflammation of blood or lymphatic vessels. this inflammation can lead to the formation of scar tissue. connective tissue disorders. according to the national institutes of health about 30% of men with peyronie's disease also develop disorders that affect the connective tissue in other parts of their bodies such as the hands and feet. these conditions generally cause a thickening or hardening of the connective tissue. connective tissue is specialized tissue -- such as cartilage bone and skin -- that acts to support other body tissues. heredity. some studies suggest that a man who has a relative with peyronie's disease is at greater risk for developing the disease himself.	what causes peyronie's disease?

you seem concerned by the possibility of autism in your 4 year old son. autism includes a broad spectrum of symptoms. therefore a single brief evaluation cannot predict a child's true abilities. ideally a team of different specialists will evaluate the child. they might evaluate:communication language motor skills speech success at school thinking abilities because there is no biological test for autism the diagnosis will often be based on very specific criteria from a book called the diagnostic and statistical manual iv. autism can be associated with other disorders that affect the brain such as:fragile x syndrome mental retardation tuberous sclerosis you must consult an appropriate medical facility where autism kids are evaluated and treated as the same is not possible online. hope this helps. take care. note: this answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.	my spn is 4 years old due to go to full time school reception in january 2012. his teacher along with a senco teacher said to me that they feel that he may have autism. the reason they gave were he does not always look at them when they are talking to him he may do group work for 10 minutes then he is not interested and gets distracted by things around him. and he cannot ride a bike. firstly i have not taught him to ride a bike so hence why he cannot and he has not taught himself. they say he can read knows colours shapes alphabet numbers all the names of the children in his class if they put something up they think he cannot read he can. he doesn't hold his pen properly. he can hold conversations with children and adults i potty trained him in a month aug 2010 he asked for things says please and thank you. gives me direct eye contact when i talk to him or anyone family based. only when he is excited he flaps his hands. at 4 i think he is on point for his age. what do u think

there are some skills that you can develop to help you improve your ability to manage anger. just like with any other skill set it’s best to practice when you don’t have the pressure of needing to be doing it well in that moment. with this in mind consider the following abcd approach: activity: exercise regularly and then also do it when you feel your anger building. if you don’t already have an exercise routine explore different types of exercise to find the ones you most enjoy (e. g. jogging weight lifting pilates). breathing: deep (or diaphragmatic) breathing can be very helpful in calming down or reducing anxiety. you breathe slowly taking time to pause at the end of each inhale and exhale. with this kind of breathing your stomach will ‘inflate’ like a balloon when you inhale and ‘deflate’ when you exhale. meanwhile your chest will not expand. if this is difficult for you try lying on your back with your knees pulled up and your feet flat on the floor. it can also help to place a hand on your stomach to feel its rise on your inhale. calming activity: find a hobby or activity that you enjoy and can engage in with your full attention. examples are gardening yoga painting or playing music. deepening understanding — of yourself and the other person: it can be extremely helpful to be aware of what ‘pushes your buttons. ’ by fully understanding this you can step back and see it happening which also means that you will not be as caught up in it and can choose to respond differently. so for instance you might say to yourself “there i go again. every time someone even implies that i’m not doing a good job i get furious. ” it can also be helpful to understand the person triggering your anger. chances are that they think their actions are valid; so by understanding their perspective (even if you disagree) you might be able to lessen your own anger and even respond in a way that they can respond more positively to.	how can i manage my anger?

workers comp -- i assume that's what w/c stands for -- operates differently than other types of medical insurance. health insurers cannot deny you coverage any longer because of a pre-existing medical condition. however care covered under worker's comp functions differently. typically to be covered by workers comp your medical condition must be the result of an injury directly related to your work. your employer pays the bills for injuries or worsening physical condition caused by an injury that happened on the job. if it can prove that you had the same condition prior to filing the claim your employer can argue that the condition already existed and is not the result of a work-related injury. in that case you may not receive coverage. in that case you would need to have your condition covered by your health insurance assuming you have coverage.	why is that i recently fell at work went to er for eval and i have a pre-existing condition w/c won't treat-tumor. my ortho dr knows about this was examined by dr prior to fall. now won't see me for this pre-existing condition. i am now is severe pain due to fall what do i do?

if the fluid in the middle ear is present longer than three months it should be surgically removed by aspiration and usually tubes placed. this protects the hearing. trapped middle ear fluid is supposed by be naturally absorbed by the body but during this absorption process the fluid can become more viscous/thicker and even become glue-like. a vacuum can develop sucking the eardrum inward to the point where it cannot move and those tiny little middle ear bones cannot transmit sounds normally. in this case even tubes will not help it drain. it must be removed or hearing will become threatened. after watchful waiting to delay putting in tubes and having this fluid aspirated there are no medical alternatives. no medications will reduce this fluid if the body does not naturally reabsorb it.	if you have fluid in your middle ear how do you get it out even with tube in ears?

tunnel vision is a medical condition that results in a loss of peripheral vision. as a result the patient can only see objects from within a circular field. this condition has many possible causes including problems in the brain some eye diseases hallucinogenic drugs and certain extreme activities. blood loss to parts of the brain can lead to tunnel vision as can a tumor pressing against the optic never fibers. a person who is exposed to air that has been contaminated by oils and hydraulic fluids such as may happen in an airplane and during hard exercise may also develop this condition. becoming ill while in an aircraft can cause temporary vision problems. the pressure placed on the optic nerve causes the eye to lose retinal ganglion cells which can eventually cause the patient to go blind. for some patients a loss of peripheral vision may be experienced prior to blindness.	after hard phys exercise sometimes get bad tunnel vision and a big ball of light right where i try to focus my eyes. why? . i've got a heart murmour and my mum dad and all 4 grand parents had diabetes. not a good start! drama is that after particularly cheeky physical exercise i sometimes get really bad tunnel vision and what seems like a big ball of light right where i'm trying to focus feel dizzy and like i've got pins and needles in both hands. lasts for about 2 hours then goes back to normal. asked the med centre on camp and they have no idea.

without knowing the exact drink that you would like to use it is hard to say whether it would be an issue with the current medications you are taking. you should certainly be careful with energy drinks. they can contain lots of sugars herbals and caffeine. specific products vary so it is important to know the exact ingredients in whatever you’re thinking about taking. in general herbal medications do not work well with the medications you are taking. for the energy you need i would consider replacing energy drinks and supplement usage with sleep exercise and a better diet making sure to take a daily multivitamin as well.	is it safe for me to have a 6-hour energy drink if i’m on trazodone depakote and celexa?
anyone with a colon can get colorectal cancer – a collective term that includes both colon cancer and rectal cancer. in the united states it’s the third most common serious cancer in men and women. it's estimated that over 24 000 men died from colorectal cancer in 2008 making it the third leading cause of cancer death in men after lung and prostate cancers. and new evidence suggests that men may benefit more than women from earlier colorectal cancer screening. overall only about 6% of men in the u. s. develop colorectal cancer but several factors increase your risk: age: men younger than 40 almost never develop colorectal cancer. over 90% of the cases are in men over 50. family history: if people in your immediate family or near relations had colorectal cancer at a young age you should be screened earlier. previous colorectal cancer: if you've had cancer removed already you're at higher risk to develop a new one. inflammatory bowel disease: if you have had a condition such as crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis for several years your risk of colorectal cancer goes up. other conditions that appear to raise the risk of colorectal cancer include: drinking more than two alcoholic drinks per day obesity smoking diabetes a high-fat diet with fat coming mostly from meat.	which men are at a risk for colorectal cancer?

i'm sorry you're going through this. it certainly sounds unpleasant. i suggest you get checked out by your gynecologist. several issues could cause the symptoms you're describing one of which is endometriosis. although it's thought of as a middle-aged women's condition endometriosis can occur in women of all ages. endometriosis occurs when the tissue that normally lines the uterine wall begins growing outside the uterus. typically this tissue attaches to other structures like the ovaries or the bowels. i'm not diagnosing you with endometriosis by any means. i just wanted to give one example of a condition that could cause symptoms similar to what you describe. an ovarian cyst is another possibility. and so i recommend you make a trip to the gynecologist. a physical exam coupled with some other testing can get you diagnosed and treated so you can stop having these uncomfortable symptoms. wishing you well!	i am 27 years old experiencing hot flashes headaches abnormal menstrual periods bloated lower abdomen pelvic pain. dryness when intimate with husband or low sex drive.

most helpful answer here are some tips on how to stay full longer: make sure you get plenty of fiber to meals. fiber is found in fruits vegetables and whole grains. beans are really high in fiber and make great additions to salads and are good as a side dish. protein is also very filling so include a source at each meal -- nut butters meat eggs beans (fiber and protein) and tofu are all good sources. fat is very satisfying and adds extra calories so make sure you have a fat source at each meal. that might be nuts on your oatmeal avocado on a salad or sandwich or olive oil when roasting veggies. healthy fats such as those from plants and fish are the best health wise. dairy and/or non-dairy alternatives are important as your calcium needs are high. try greek yogurt with nuts milk in your oatmeal and cheese in sandwiches and mixed dishes. the key is to add as many food groups as possible for satisfaction nutrition and to manage your hunger. for more ideas see this webmd article.	why am i always hungry? . i am a 17 year old girl and i'm always hungry. i primarily eat healthy. no soda or chips. i eat 3-5 full meals a day. i eat oatmeal fruit veggies and meat. i drink over 10 glasses of water a day. i don't gain weight. i am 5'8 and 130lb. i am physically active. why am i so hungry? what can i do to stay full longer?
assuming you are female it is possible to have both of these stds without having any symptoms. in females chlamydia can be primarily vaginal but it can spread into your uterus/fallopian tubes where it can cause scarring to the point where you could end up with a tubal (ectopic) pregnancy or perhaps a pid (pelvic inflammatory disease). one of the reasons we routinely test sexually-active people for chlamydia is because the symptoms can be subtle. we often find many surprises in an adolescent clinic when we routinely screen. hsv-2 or herpes can be another stealth std. most of the time the initial outbreak of herpes is an event that most people will not forget but it is also not uncommon for people to have blood evidence of past exposure with no memory of every having it. not all outbreaks are horrible so a minor outbreak may have been misdiagnosed as simple soreness or itching. men with stds can also have variable symptoms. i find many young men with chlamydia who do not know they have it and many with an outbreak of herpes who think they just have a rash from an allergic reaction to soap or laundry detergent. this is precisely why routine screening is a good thing.	is it possible to be asymtomatic to multiple std's? . i was recently diagnosed with hsv-2 and clamydia during a semi-routine std screening. to this day i still have not seen an outbreak from the hsv-2 and never noticed any abnormalities associated with the clamydia. is it possible to be asymptomatic for both of these std's?

"once you and your clinician have decided that it's time to stop what's the best approach? the simple answer is that we don't know. formal studies to evaluate this question have failed to show that either going cold turkey or tapering off is better. so the choice is really yours. the important thing is to know that women in general have about a 50/50 chance of experiencing hot flashes again (although maybe not as severe as initially) after stopping. some studies suggest that symptoms peak within 3 months after stopping hormones. after you stop take some time to evaluate how you feel before beginning any new medication so you don't get the two effects confused. there are a couple of other things to keep an eye on once you've stopped ht. if you develop vaginal dryness or recurrent urinary tract infections ask your clinician about vaginal estrogens. nonhormonal lubricants and moisturizers can also help with dryness. and you might want to ask about a bone density test. we know that women who stop ht often lose bone. depending on your bone density score and risk profile you might be a candidate for an osteoporosis drug (bone-sparing). at any rate discuss calcium and vitamin d supplements weight-bearing exercise and fall prevention with your clinician. another good idea is to have your cholesterol rechecked in about 3 months after stopping ht because hormones can affect ""lipid levels"" (both good and bad). and if you're taking a thyroid medication for an underactive thyroid your dose might need to be adjusted. thanks for your reply!"	what is the best way to stop hormone replacement therapy?

diarrhea is a condition that once again as a pharmacist i can tell you all the time i ask a lot of questions especially around the fact of are you running a fever? how long have you had the diarrhea for? is the diarrhea -- do you have dark though diarrhea? because that could be a sign of internal bleeding. so you want to be very careful about the suggestions that we make. in the case of diarrhea too medications sometimes aren't always the best choice. you want to change your diet? you want to make sure that you are hydrated. a lot of people forget that when you have diarrhea you lose a lot of fluids. so you want to do re-hydration first. things like pedialyte increasing your water intake and then introducing all foods in general. typically in the past there was something called the brat diet which was bran rice applesauce and toast to help with diarrhea. that actually is not the recommendation anymore they actually want people to start eating pretty normally to get their body back in balance as well as increasing their fluids. only then if there are some problems where they say you know i've been increasing my diet i still have a little bit of diarrhea imodium or something like that be appropriate. but we do need to ask a few questions to find out what is really going on?	what's the best over-the- counter treatment for diarrhea?

follow-up exams are important after treatment for colon cancer. the cancer can recur near the original site or in a distant organ such as the liver or lung. follow-up exams include a physical examination by the doctor blood tests of liver enzymes chest x-rays cat scans of the abdomen and pelvis colonoscopies and blood cea levels. abnormal liver enzymes may indicate growth of liver metastasis. cea levels may be elevated before surgery and become normal shortly after the cancer is removed. slowly rising cea level may indicate cancer recurrence. a cat scan of the abdomen and pelvis can show tumor recurrence in the liver pelvis or other areas. colonoscopy can show recurrence of polyps or cancer in the large intestine. in addition to checking for cancer recurrence patients who have had colon cancer may have an increased risk of cancer of the prostate breast and ovary. therefore follow-up examinations should include these areas.	what is the follow-up care for colon cancer?

the simple answer is nothing. diarrhea is a purging mechanism so the body can eliminate toxins (poisons created by the viral pathogens). diarrhea although it can be inconvenient is really helpful in getting him well. some of these illnesses can last a week but diarrhea lasting longer than this time or very severe diarrhea that may contain blood in the stools should be brought to the immediate attention of his pediatrician or medical provider. the most important thing for you to do is maintain adequate hydration. water electrolyte solution (like pedialyte) juices yogurt etc. are all helpful a diet containing rice applesauce toast or bananas have been helpful as well. since he is diapered you can contain the watery stools (most of the time) but make sure to change him after stooling as quickly as you can since diarrhea can lead to a nasty diaper rash. use a coating of vaseline or other protective barriers in the diaper area is helpful. in no time his diarrhea should slow down stop and then his bowel movements should return to normal.	my 1 yr old has the stomach flu. what medications can i give him for diarrhea?
you know hysterectomies were done almost on every woman back twenty years ago it was like oh you need a hysterectomy. today i look at a hysterectomy done when a patient has severe bleeding from fibroids that cannot be controlled in any other way. she’s tried medication she’s tried birth control pills she’s tried possibly even ablation or a d&c. she’s bleeding she’s anemic the fibroids are the cause she may need a hysterectomy. someone who has enlarging fibroids they are just getting bigger and bigger. there is embolization which could decrease your fibroids by 60% however some women do not respond to it or they are not wanting to do an embolization and they may need a hysterectomy. and of course women that have uterine cancer or have some other form of ovarian cancer possibly may even need a hysterectomy. but i think that birth control pills sometimes can be used instead to control abnormal bleeding. there are other options out there first. i think it should be your last resort.	when should a hysterectomy be performed?

alcohol has been implicated in infertility early miscarriage as well as in birth defects. the amount of alcohol consumption necessary to cause these problems is not known and varies among women. some women can drink excessively and have normal infants. others consume considerably less alcohol but still give birth to babies with cognitive disabilities and/or other birth defects. it is generally believed that the greater the amount of alcohol consumed during pregnancy the greater the risk of pregnancy-related problems and birth defects. it is recommended that pregnant women avoid all consumption of alcohol. fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a group of conditions reflecting the possible effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. the fasds include fetal alcohol syndrome (fas) alcohol-related birth defects (arbd) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disabilities (arnd). fetal alcohol syndrome (fas) is the extreme end of the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and is a leading cause of cognitive disabilities.	how does alcohol affect pregnancy?

see your medical provider. yes xanax can help anxiety (your reaction to stress assuming this is what is causing your symptoms) but it will not help the underlying causes of stress. xanax is part of a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines and is prescribed for anxiety and panic disorders. you may have heard the terms ssri (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or gaba (gamma amino butyric acid) - xanax changes brain function by altering gaba production in the brain at the receptor sites which alters the person’s mood. when used appropriately xanax is very effective. studies have shown that long-term xanax use can lead to dependence and addiction. quitting xanax use cold turkey can be dangerous because the nature of the drugs slows gaba (gamma amino butyric acid) production and changes brain chemistry. suddenly stopping xanax use can be too much for the brain to adjust to can result in serious side effects including horrifying nightmares delusions seizures and death. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	will xanax help with my stress. i am so stressed out i feel sick cant sleep cold sweats my neck burns my face is hot and i dont know what to do.

i'm sorry to hear this. headaches can go beyond annoying to actually disrupting your life. if you're in otherwise good health you might try increasing your water intake. dehydration can cause a chronic low-level headache. caffeine withdrawal also can cause a headache so if you drink coffee or other other caffeinated beverages regularly any reduction in your intake could give you a headache. if your headache has any of the features of migraine i'd suggest you see your health care provider for an evaluation. for many people migraine is treatable. if your headache is very severe or just won't go away i'd again recommend you see your doctor. a chronic headache can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition that can only be diagnosed by a physical examination. i hope you feel better soon!	i keep having headche even i diet good and i dont think i have stressful life am happy

most lip plumpers work as a local irritant. these “plumpers” contain ingredients that might cause temporary swelling such as peppermint oil peppers and menthoxypropanediol a potent derivative of menthol. unfortunately there are not many scientific or multi-institutional studies to demonstrate the long-term efficacy of lip plumpers. if you're looking for a slight temporary plumping of the lips for a special evening out you may be satisfied with the results you get from these cosmetic lip plumpers. if your lips are thin and you're looking for that bee stung look you'll likely be disappointed. use of a lip plumper combined with cosmetic techniques that add the illusion of fuller lips such as using a lip liner slightly outside the natural line of the lips may provide a more satisfying illusion of fullness or you can always play up one of your better features such as your eyes to draw attention away from your thin lips. <link> <link>	do over-the-counter lip-plumping products really work?

phentermine is a central nervous system appetite suppressant. it has properties similar to an amphetamine. this medication is generally prescribed for a period not to exceed 2-3 weeks to control weight gain along with diet and exercise. your yo-yo results may be a result of taking the medication over a 5 week period. you may also be experiencing a counter-intuitive side-effect of having increased hunger. at any rate the doctor who prescribed the medication should be contacted. you should not attempt to increase decrease or stop phentermine by yourself as serious side-effects symptoms may occur. here is the positive news: during the last 10 years your weight was pretty constant at 150 lbs. to 155 lbs. based upon having a medium built along with your sex height and age the range of ideal weight for you should be 126lbs. to 154 lbs. the suggested mean weight for you is 140 lbs. that tells me that you were doing well with your weight prior to becoming injured. here are my suggestions: talk with your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program. in order to maintain your current weight of 170 lbs. your average calorie intake is about 2300 per day. i recommend that you cut back on your daily calorie intake by 500 calories. taking in 1800 calories per day will result in 1 pound per week weight loss. the 1800 calories should be divided as follows: protein- 15% or 270 calories carbohydrates- 55% or 991 calories and fats- 30% or 539 calories. losing 1 pound per week is safe and will result in a 20 pound weight loss within 5 months. by combining some moderate exercise with your diet you’ll be back to your more typical weight of 150 pounds before you know it. you may lose weight quicker by reducing your calories to 1400 calories per day and by increasing your exercise routine. to be safe and effective i recommend not skipping meals or reducing your daily calories below 1300. the internet is loaded with 1800 daily calorie menus that are nutritious filling include snacks and contain varied and delicious foods. some of these menus even come with a weekly shopping list of necessary food and ingredients along with recipes for the main courses. dieting can be more fulfilling when shared with another person. see if a friend or family member will join you in your weight loss program. reward yourself for weight losses by having your hair or nails done.	how to get off of diet pills? . i've been on phentermine for 5 weeks now. it has been a no eat binge eat exercise it off bad cycle. 1 day i'll eat 400 calories next day binge eat everything next day try to exercise for 2 hours or more? . how do i get off this nightmare? suggestions how to eat? afraiid to get even bigger. current weight 170ish @ 5'8. last 10 year weight 150 to 155. last 8 months didn't run injury and weight went out of control. help! i'm 43 year old woman.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. chronic constipation can be more than a painful nuisance. it can cause other health problems such as a bowel obstruction. the bleeding you see after you have a bowel movement may be caused by hemorrhoids especially if the blood is bright red in color. however any type of bleeding from the colon is worth having checked out by a medical professional. your best bet is to attack the cause of your chronic constipation. eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables to get needed fiber. avoid using laxatives as this can make the problem worse in a yo-yo sort of way. be sure to drink plenty of water. hydration is very important for avoiding constipation. i hope you find some relief soon!

this is a fun question and i'm glad you asked! first of all let me set your mind at ease on one point: soy milk does not contain estrogen. the benefits of soy in easing menopausal symptoms in women is still debated but that doesn't mean it contains estrogen. it doesn't. in asia soy is widely consumed by both sexes and i don't think asian men have worse man-boobs than other men. men and women both produce estrogen and testosterone. as men age they produce less testosterone which may allow estrogen to play a more dominant role which can lead to man-boobs. in women aging reduces estrogen production which may allow their natural testosterone to play a more dominant role and they may get mustaches. i ask you: which is less fair? but to your question: almond milk should not have any estrogenic effects so drink away! assuming you're not allergic to almonds at least. hope this helps!

if you are exposed to carbon monoxide or if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected your doctor will ask questions about your medical history. questions may include how long symptoms have been present what the source of possible exposure to carbon monoxide is how many other people (family members or coworkers) have the same symptoms and what home heating and cooking appliances have been used. with this information your doctor may decide that a test for carbon monoxide is necessary. the standard test for carbon monoxide measures the amount of hemoglobin that has bonded with carbon monoxide. this amount is also called the carboxyhemoglobin (cohb) level. testing should never delay treatment. treatment should be started as soon as possible. other tests such as an arterial blood gas (abg) and a complete blood count (cbc) also may be done if you have or are suspected of having carbon monoxide poisoning. these tests may be done to evaluate your overall health or to identify problems caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. a handheld breath analyzer measures how much carbon monoxide is in the air you exhale. this test measures high levels of the gas but may not be reliable in detecting low levels. other tests questionnaires and other tests may be used to detect subtle changes in your ability to think clearly if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected. they also may be used to determine what other treatment is needed. if you do have carbon monoxide poisoning you will probably have tests to check for heart damage such as ecg and cardiac enzyme studies. early detection there is no routine screening for carbon monoxide poisoning. if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected further tests will be done. in the winter months carbon monoxide poisoning may be suspected in people who go to the emergency room with symptoms of a severe headache nausea or dizziness. information about a person's home workplace and any illness of family members and coworkers is often gathered to determine whether a test for carbon monoxide should be done. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for carbon monoxide poisoning?

first congratulations on taking this important first step in reducing your weight to a healthy level! i salute you. second be sure you've received the ok from your health care provider to undertake a diet and exercise program. if your doctor has cleared you to exercise then your shortness of breath may be normal simply due to your current size. don't let this discourage you. it may not be realistic for you to expect to perform say 20 minutes of aerobic activity at this point. that time will come. right now 2 minutes might actually be more realistic for you. i'd suggest you start with simply walking. if you can manage to walk for 2 minutes 10 times a day there's your 20 minutes. do that every day and you'll gradually build up stamina. if you've been watching one of those television shows where 300+ pound people engage in vigorous workouts and lose dramatic amounts of weight quickly i'd suggest you stop watching. in my opinion those programs do not depict a realistic vision of exercise for people who weigh over 300 pounds. the workouts shown on those programs are closely monitored by an entire medical team and can be dangerous for the average unsupervised exerciser. again i can't stress how much i admire you for your determination. try checking out webmd's diet community for support and access to experts who can help you on your journey. be patient. it may take you quite some time to lose all the weight you want to lose. remember to set intermediate goals and rewards along the way to stay motivated. best wishes to you! don’t give up! although you may not be able to exercise for long now you should expect to see less shortness of breath and better cardiovascular endurance the longer you stay consistent with your exercise routine. be sure that you’re not trying to do too much with your exercise. it may be best to start out with a low intensity level of exercise and expanding upon it as tolerated. it may not seem like a lot at first but you can slowly and gradually build up the duration and intensity of your exercise the more that you are able to adhere to it. remember your exercise doesn’t have to be done all in one session. divide it up and takes breaks to rest and recover if you need to and then pick it back up later. you may be able to continually shorten the amount of rest that you take in between sessions to eventually spend more time in a single session. also try building in more opportunities to incorporate more physically activity within your daily routine. try taking the stairs instead of the elevator or park further away. making a habit out of incorporating small opportunities like these can ultimately lead to becoming better conditioned for exercise. if exercise remains to be too difficult i’d still encourage you to continue to do what you can but i’d suggest placing more of an emphasis on your nutrition to lose enough weight until you’re at the point that you can exercise more comfortably. keep up the great work! remember to always consult your doctor before beginning an exercise routine or weight loss plan. please keep one thing in mind. you did not gain the weight over a few months so don't expect it to magically fall off in a few months; there are no shortcuts just dedication and the will power you will need to get your butt off the couch and head outside (or treadmill) and walk everyday. at first just do what you can but make a training schedule and follow it - you are accountable to no one but yourself so don't let yourself down! i will not do you any favors by lying to you or telling you loosing weight is easy. as you know it is not. it is a long hard journey to loose the weight but if your mindset is right and your willpower is strong (do it for no one but yourself). then you are on your way to a successful weight loss journey! good luck! btw. before putting something in your mouth ask yourself if you are really hungry if you are not - ask yourself why you are eating. congrats on this big step in life! you can do it! however to safely do it i would go to your local ymca and have a professional check you out( your heart rate ect. ) they will put you on a plan that fits you!	im 314lbs and trying to lose weight. i cant excercise 2 min before im gasping for air. how can i get a work out in?

most helpful answer there may be hundreds of possible (allergic causes). it would be impossible to determine which one or more allergens without an extensive medical history and perhaps some allergy testing. in the meantime consider taking a long-acting antihistamine (claritin zyrtec allegra) since whatever is causing this reaction is still in your midst.	itching in hands feet & lower legs. it feels like skin & interior. antihis controls it a few hours. cause? what do i do? . i've had this severe itching for 3 days.

that depends (not a pun). laxatives are somewhat unpredictable so individual responses cannot be determined in advance. if he was truly constipated then this gentle stimulant type laxative should work sometime in the next 24 hours but that would depend on the dosage the amount of constipation and of course his individual response. assuming the school has a readily-available toilet for him to use when the fletcher's kicks in he will be fine. i don't know his age but keep in mind that boys often hate to use the bathroom at school due to the lack of cleanliness and privacy. if you don't believe me check it out yourself some day. shy boys tend to urinate in the stalls and will pee on the toilet seats (and floor) so boys refuse to sit on them. many stalls have non-working doors and some elementary school have rules and penalties for using the toilet during class time. some young kids would hold it until they explode rather than miss a recess. so the choice is yours. if you have used this in the past for your son and know what to expect you will need to decide if it is reasonable for him to go to school with a laxative that may still be on-board.	my son took 1 dose of fletchers laxative for kids around 6 this morning. will he be ok to go to school tomorrow?

although annual influenza (injectable) vaccination has long been recommended for people in the high-risk groups many still do not receive the vaccine often because of their concern about side effects. they mistakenly perceive influenza as merely a nuisance and believe that the vaccine causes unpleasant side effects or that it may even cause the flu. the truth is that influenza vaccine causes no side effects in most people. the most common and serious side effect that can occur after influenza vaccination is an allergic reaction in people who have a severe allergy to eggs since the viruses used in the vaccine are grown in hens' eggs. for this reason people who have an allergy to eggs should see an allergy specialist before receiving the influenza vaccine. also the vaccine is not recommended while individuals have active infections or active diseases of the nervous system. less than one-third of those who receive the vaccine have some soreness at the vaccination site and about 5% to 10% experience mild side effects such as headache low-grade fever or muscle cramps for about a day after vaccination. these side effects are most likely to occur in children who have not been exposed to influenza virus in the past. another type of influenza vaccine (nasal spray) is made with live attenuated (altered) influenza viruses. this vaccine is made with live viruses that can stimulate the immune response enough to confer immunity but do not cause classic influenza symptoms (in most instances). the nasal spray vaccine (flumist) is only approved for healthy individuals ages 2 to 49. this nasal spray vaccine contains live attenuated virus (less able to cause flu symptoms due to a designed inability to replicate at normal body temperatures). this live vaccine could possibly cause the disease in infants and immunocompromised people and does not produce a strong immune response in many older people. side effects of the nasal mist include nasal congestion sore throat and fever. headaches muscle aches irritability and malaise have also been noted. in most instances if side effects occur they only last a day or two. this nasal spray has been produced for conventional flu viruses and should not be given to pregnant individuals or anyone who has a medical condition that may compromise the immune system because in some instances the flu is the side effect. caregivers should read the vaccine precaution insert before giving any vaccine injectable or nasal as these inserts are occasionally updated.	are there any flu shot side effects in adults or in children?

most helpful answer the chance of getting pregnant during your menses is slim. the chance of you getting an sexually-transmitted disease from having unprotected sex with two different guys is high. did you miss that class when you were in high school? you are considered a high-risk patient so it would be in you best interest to be tested for the plethora of stds out there. in the event that you did not contract one you need to bless your lucky stars. sex is fun. sex is natural but it is not worth dying over. did you all go together and get tested and did you see their results? no? then how do you really know that they don't have anything? if you are going to have multiple sex partners you really should use protection (you should use protection even if its one partner and you don't want to get pregnant. ) just go get tested and use protection next time. i wante to know what type of std' test would have to be done? i know that there clean and so am i. but with that i can still get an std?	having sex with two different guys a day apart and on my menstrual. i do know that the two guys are clean and so am i but iam worried since i didnt use protection and since ive heard that you can get so many diseases when you have your menstrual and you have sex. if i can please get some answers iam really worried. if i can end up getting a diease or even having the ability of getting pregnant.
"if you're talking about cleaning out your children's ear canals then my advice is ""don't.

don't be embarrassed. half of the people on this planet have penises; and 85% of those are uncircumcised (the way nature made you). you are going to need some medical help. a prescription for a special steroid cream that can help you retract your foreskin in about a month or so. if not there are other methods that can be done. do not force the retraction to the point where you may be unable to pull it back again. this can create a painful tourniquet from the tight foreskin. this can be fixed my friend but you need to talk to your mum. i think she knows you have a penis even though she hasn't seen it for a while. she can find you a male medical provider who can help.	how do i pull back my tight foreskin? . hi i have not been able to pull back my foreskin for a long time. i have only just thought that it is not normal. i'm 13 and when i go to pull it back i can't it hardly retracts there is just a tiny hole where i can see some of my glans. is there a way that i can cure this without going to see a doctor as i don't want to feel embarrassed i havent even told my mum. any advice would be appreciated thanks in advance
in general basic first aid for any chemical in the eye is constant flushing with water (preferably distilled water but tap water will do) for a minimum of 15 minutes. while you're doing this have someone else call 911 for emergency assistance. the flushing should be gentle but continuous. gently hold the eye open while allowing the water to run across the eyeball and down into the sink. it's helpful to hold your head sideways (at a 90-degree angle) to accomplish this. when emergency medical assistance arrives try to give them the container of the chemical you got in your eye. this will help them determine what further treatment you need. hope this helps!	what to do for hand cleaner in eyes?

"your problem could be psychological or physical or perhaps even a bit of both. either way the erectile dysfunction can be easily rectified with several different medicines designed to increase (and maintain) blood flow engorgement to the penis. if you maintain your erection longer you will not likely have any related performance anxiety so the problem could fix itself with a little blue pill. you may not always need it but you may find this to be a temporary solution. these require a prescription so you will need to ask your medical provider. just one ""failure to perform"" could create a feeling that it will happen again so this is where the psychological component plays a role. assuming you do not have any underlying medical issues or psychological stresses affecting your life at the moment this should get you back in the saddle again. what can i do about it"	"i am having trouble keeping my penis hard during vaginal sex. the feeling/sensation in my penis seems to disappear. i am having trouble keeping my penis hard during vaginal sex. often times the feeling/sensation in my penis seems to disappear and my ""hard-on"" quickly disappears. this is never an issue with oral sex or from handjobs and alcohol is not a factor either. this is the first steady girlfriend i have ever had and find her beyond attractive more so than anyone other sexual partner in my past. i have never had a steady sexual partner in my past so the problem never had a chance to come to light."

thinning hair is a very common problem. it's as common in women as it is in men. but unfortunately for women it's much harder to conceal. and women don't really have the option of going bald and being proud of it the way men do sometimes. so it is important to be able to disguise that. let's start with the underlying causes. there are two types of hair loss that occur in women: scarring and non-scarring. the most common is non-scarring and this tends to be genetic and familial. even if no one in your family had hair loss it can still happen to you and still be part of your genetic makeup. so once you have that issue it's important to be evaluated by a dermatologist or internist or ob/gyn. there are a lot of doctors who can do the evaluations for you. sometimes we check hormonal levels. often even if the hormone tests come back normal there is still somewhat of an hormonal imbalance that may be occurring. people often think that thyroid changes can lead to hair loss but it really doesn't. it may make your hair more dry and brittle but doesn't typically make your hair fall out. but it's worth having your thyroid checked as well to make sure that everything is in order. taking supplements does not really help hair growth. i have a lot of patients who take biotin to help their hair grow. but it doesn't really help if you don't have a biotin deficiency. biotin will make your hair stronger potentially again only if you have a deficiency in that area. there are no other supplements that i know of that have been proven in the literature to help grow hair. however having any nutritional imbalance may have an effect on your hair. another cause of hair loss would be stress. sometimes when you have a stress you can see the hair loss starting about three months later. you have to think about what stress you might have had three to four months before because that's about how long it takes to show. to conceal hair loss you can try combing your hair different changing your hair style or coloring it a little closer to your own natural scalp or skin color. use more neutral tones as opposed to a very dark or light tones. also there are powders that you can add to your hair that work as hair expanders to make your hair appear more full and thick. the one thing you don't want to do is to over tease or over process your hair because then you are pulling it out and causing more damage.	i am a perimenopausal woman and i have started noticing that my hair is thinning. what can i do to fix this?
there are several types of gallstones and each type has a different cause. cholesterol gallstones cholesterol gallstones are made primarily of cholesterol. they are the most common type of gallstone comprising 80% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas. cholesterol is one of the substances that liver cells secrete into bile. (secretion of cholesterol into bile is an important way in which the liver eliminates excess cholesterol from the body). in order for bile to carry cholesterol the cholesterol must be dissolved in the bile. cholesterol is a fat however and bile is an aqueous or watery solution; fats do not dissolve in watery solutions. in order to make the cholesterol dissolve in bile the liver also secretes two detergents -- bile acids and lecithin -- into the bile. these detergents just like dishwashing detergents dissolve the fatty cholesterol so that it can be carried by bile through the ducts. if the liver secretes too much cholesterol for the amount of bile acids and lecithin it secretes some of the cholesterol does not dissolve. similarly if the liver does not secrete enough bile acids and lecithin some of the cholesterol also does not dissolve. in either case the undissolved cholesterol sticks together and forms particles of cholesterol that grow in size and eventually form larger gallstones. there are two other processes that promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones though neither process is able to cause cholesterol gallstones by itself. the first is abnormally rapid formation and growth of cholesterol particles into gallstones. thus with the same concentrations of cholesterol bile acids and lecithin in their bile patients with gallstones form particles of cholesterol more rapidly than individuals without gallstones. the second process that promotes the formation and growth of gallstones is reduced contraction and emptying of the gallbladder that allows bile to sit in the gallbladder longer so that there is more time for cholesterol particles to form and grow. pigment gallstones pigment gallstones are the second most common type of gallstone. although pigment gallstones comprise only 15% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas they are more common than cholesterol gallstones in southeast asia. there are two types of pigment gallstones 1) black pigment gallstones and 2) brown pigment gallstones. pigment is a waste product formed from hemoglobin the oxygen-carrying chemical in red blood cells. the hemoglobin from old red blood cells that are being destroyed is changed into a chemical called bilirubin and released into the blood. bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver. the liver modifies the bilirubin and secretes the modified bilirubin or into bile. black pigment gallstones: if there is too much bilirubin in bile the bilirubin combines with other constituents in bile for example calcium to form pigment (so-called because it is dark brown in color). pigment dissolves poorly in bile and like cholesterol it sticks together and forms particles that grow in size and eventually form gallstones. the pigment gallstones that form in this manner are called black pigment gallstones because they are black and hard. brown pigment gallstones: if there is reduced contraction of the gallbladder or obstruction to the flow of bile through the ducts bacteria may ascend from the duodenum into the bile ducts and gallbladder. the bacteria alter the bilirubin in the ducts and gallbladder and the altered bilirubin then combines with calcium to form pigment. the pigment then combines with fats in bile (cholesterol and fatty acids from lecithin) to form particles that grow into gallstones. this type of gallstone is called a brown pigment gallstone because it is more brown than black. it also is softer than black pigment gallstones. other types of gallstones. other types of gallstones are rare. perhaps the most interesting type of gallstone is the gallstone that forms in patients taking the antibiotic ceftriaxone (rocephin). ceftriaxone is unusual in that it is eliminated from the body in bile in high concentrations. it combines with calcium in bile and becomes insoluble. like cholesterol and pigment the insoluble ceftriaxone and calcium form particles that grow into gallstones. most of these gallstones disappear once the antibiotic is stopped but they still may cause problems until they disappear. another rare type of gallstone is formed from calcium carbonate.	what causes gallstones?

a better goal than focusing on scale weight is to keep track of body fat. the goals should be to decrease body fat and optimize bone strength. for a man a body fat percentage of 18% to 25% is not bad for 40-plus. for women 40-plus 22% to 27% is not bad. to get that body fat percentage you need to have excellent fitness to maintain a good muscle base. also a man should have a waist circumference below 40 inches and a woman below 35 inches.	should my goal weight increase when i hit midlife?

"the only real way to know is to ask. however if your employer tells you it is eliminating insurance because of the law i would be wary of the answer. in fact the law requires all employers with 50 or more workers to either offer health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty for failing to do so. they'll also pay a penalty if at least one full-time employee receives a subsidy to help buy insurance through one of the new marketplaces. today 98% of employers with more than 200 workers already offer health insurance as do 94% of businesses with 50 to 199 employees. and they’ve providing insurance long before the aca became law for a host of good reasons the law doesn't change. for one providing insurance is a tax-free form of compensation. and a good benefits package helps employers compete for employees. we have heard of some small employers holding off on hiring for fear of crossing the 50-employee threshold – it could certainly raise an employer's costs if they currently employ fewer than 50 workers and don’t offer insurance. and some industries with part-time or contract workers are also reducing hours to avoid raising insurance costs because the law requires large employers to insure workers who put in on average 30 hours per week. but for small companies the law in many cases increases health plan choices and for very small companies provides tax credits that can lower insurance costs. i would need to know more about your particular employer's situation but on the face of it it doesn't seem eliminating insurance if it's already being offered makes sense because of the health reform law. i have been in the health insurance business for 40 years. the aca (obamacare) mandated a certain level of benefits that must be included in all health plans. this is identical to the what every state legislature does when it mandates what is minimum coverage for auto insurance. one wants to know that if someone crashes into you that they at least have enough insurance to fix your car if not their own. the exchanges are simply private insurance companies competing for business in a marketplace. they are all quoting the same benefit packages and are simply competing at price. no one demanded or required them to compete for this business or offer insurance in the exchanges. some exchanges have more companies offering insurance than others. these private companies are doing so because they think they can make a few bucks. it is not some government conspiracy to take over the insurance business. that having been said one may notice that no other industrialized nation on earth has seen fit to copy our health care system. it simply has not worked and i personally see very little on the horizon to make me believe it will work in the future. in fact in response to the writer who suggested more universal plans are not working and are unpopular might look only to our neighbor to the north whose health care system is quite popular with canadian citizens. i know i know canadians are marching to the us for their health care needs. this post is to short to actually address this issue but suffice to say canadians are not coming in any great numbers to the us for their basic health care needs. actually when you factor out tourists from canada who receive emergency treatment the incidence of canadians coming to the us is actually quite small and is comprised almost exclusively of higher income individuals seeking elective surgery due to the wait in canada for those types of services. take a look around the world and compare the healthcare systems of other advanced societies. many have found ways to both meet the needs of their citizens and do it at significantly less money than we spend. for your research pleasure i would recommend looking at that downtrodden and financially irresponsible country of switzerland as an example of how we might address this issue ion the future. see the book ""the healing of america; a global quest for better cheaper and fairer health care"" by t. r. reid. finally yes we have the finest health care system in the world but only if you can afford it. the answer this so called "" expert "" gave is misleading. the truth is that the aca will cost small businesses more or it will cost tax payers way more. anytime the government says they give subsidies they are talking about using the taxes they collect from you and your boss to pay for it. so it is a pay me now or pay me later thing. this law is not suppose to work. it is designed to crush privately owned insurance and collapse the healthcare system in our country. they want a single payer system. the same one that has failed in every country and in every way. so yes it will cost you more. a lot more and for less coverage. anytime an obama spokesperson talks about how obamacare isn't working they end it with"" that's why we need a single payer system"". so take what this site says with a grain of salt. they are part of healthcare. gov. this administration in the white house has lied from day one. my daughters employer switched retirees to another plan. even her disability annuity is less. she has just undergone colon surgery and the new plan does not offer her required med supplies nursing home for rehab even her disability annuity is less. read where a lot of corporations have done this - tired of everything being blamed on obama. what are people doing especially thru the surgeries infections wound pumps - when something like this happens i will put it this way. my wife has a heart condition and went without seeing a dr for almost 4 years because we could not afford the insurance. now she has seen her dr and dentist and has not paid a penny more than the premium. we are one of the few 1st world countries without a centralized health care system. the reason for that is because the insurance companies are going to loose a lot of money. aca will work and that scares the pants off the insurance companies."	how will i know if my boss gets rid of company insurance because of the affordable care act?

baby : your baby measures about 10 inches from crown to rump or a total length of about 15. 75 inches from head to toe and weighs about 2. 4 pounds. brain waves show rapid eye movement (rem) sleep which means your baby may be dreaming. eyelids are opening. branches of lungs are developing so there's a good chance that baby would survive if born prematurely now. mom-to-be : your uterus extends well above your navel. as baby gets bigger and stronger this month you may be experiencing leg cramps and mild swelling of ankles and feet difficulty sleeping shortness of breath lower abdominal achiness clumsiness or scattered braxton hicks contractions (hardening and relaxing of the uterus like rehearsals for labor). you may also be urinating more frequently again as the uterus continues to push on your bladder. tip of the week : even if your partner is planning on being with you in the delivery room you might want to consider hiring a doula -- a professional labor assistant who provides support but not medical aid for the mother and her partner. studies show that doulas can shorten a woman's labor and reduce the likelihood of needing pain medication forceps deliveries or a caesarean section.	what can i expect during week 28 of my pregnancy?
since this was your first anxiety attack i'm wondering if there are some stressor in your life currently that might be causing this. often we don't realize that we are under stress until our body tells us by doing something like this. i know it's quite upsetting can be frightening but you shouldn't be embarrassed. you have done nothing for which you need to be embarrassed. it's your body responding to something either internal or external. i see that your prescriber has done the prudent thing and has given you something to use as needed. this is always a good idea but you need to do a bit of work on your own too. as i said please review your current situation and see if there is anything that might be causing you some stress or where you have neglected yourself in terms of diet sleep or social activities. all of these are vital to maintain our physical and mental health. i would also suggest that you begin engaging in some self-help techniques such as relaxation breathing mild exercise and positive self talk.	i recently had an anxiety attack. the doctor prescribed medicine to use when i feel one coming. when will they go away?
it sounds like you are losing weight and your body is changing. here are some tips that might help: consider working with a certified personal trainer to help you incorporate strength training exercises to help build muscle while monitoring your body fat. try yoga as another way to build muscle mass. eat some protein with small amounts of carbohydrate after working out to help stimulate muscle growth (e. g. protein bar peanut butter on whole wheat toast greek yogurt with almonds). see this article for more on what to eat before and after workouts eat balanced meals which includes all the food groups -- fruit vegetables healthy fats whole grains low fat dairy and lean protein. a registered dietitian can help you develop an eating plan that helps you lose weight in a healthy way. to find one go to eatright. org even though it's hard try to be patient. it takes time to find a healthy lifestyle that works for you. get the support you need!	despite regular cardio exercise and eating healthy i can't seem to lose weight? . okay maybe i can't lose weight is misleading but i am losing muscle and gaining fat. my exercise includes running for an hour at least four times a week for over a month and eating includes eating salads eggs fruits and white meats like chicken (and none of the junk i won't even allow myself cheat days). in spite of the fact that i have lost 20lbs i don't look any thinner. in fact i've gained fat and it's becoming increasingly harder to continue keep the same running time and pace.

"people often discuss the importance of care in selecting ""safe"" foods and beverages for consumption. we recommend that foods be freshly cooked and be piping hot; such foods are safer than those on a buffet that have been sitting out for hours. water should be bottled and sealed or boiled. alcohol is ok but ice cubes are not. but sometimes people do everything they are supposed to do regarding the selection of food and beverages and still get sick. often it's really the lack of sanitation within the food industry -- contamination may occur anywhere from when the food comes out of the ground to the preparer or the server. food can be tainted at any point along that route. so restaurant hygiene and food service worker hygiene may be out of the traveler's control but both play a role in whether disease is transmitted. and sometimes it’s the travelers who contaminate themselves. remember: try to clean your hands before eating whether with soap and water or a hand sanitizer. and travelers should avoid touching their face mouth or mucous membranes with their hands."	how can i prevent travelers' diarrhea?
do what you can! it’s still beneficial for you to do as much exercise as you can even if you’re not meeting the recommended amount. keep in mind that you can break up your physical activity into as little as 10 minute sessions throughout the day which may be more mindful of your time constraints. build more physical activity into your daily routine naturally by parking further away taking the stairs instead of the elevator or using a break room or restroom on an opposite side of the building or on a different floor at work. consider finding a different mode of transportation to work or while running errands. you may live close enough to be able to walk or bike to some of the places that you need to go. if you take the bus try getting off at an earlier stop and walking a bit more. find ways to be active with your family like going for a walk or bike ride and set up a regular routine with it. fit in exercise while you’re watching tv by doing body weight exercises during commercials or use exercise equipment like a treadmill elliptical or stationary bike that you may have at home to do activity while you watch your shows. lastly write down your entire weekly schedule. this can help you to better visualize your schedule so that you can better see opportunities where you can incorporate more physical activity or perhaps you can move things around to create an opening for exercise. you may not be able to meet a recommended amount but do what you can!	what if i don’t have time to exercise 60 minutes a day?
"real testosterone supplements are a controlled substance that can only be obtained by prescription. the so-called ""male enhancement"" products you hear advertised cannot by law contain testosterone or any other controlled substance. however a number of these male enhancement pills have been recalled and confiscated over the past few years by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) because they contained illegal and unlabeled amounts of prescription drugs designed to treat erectile dysfunction. this tells me that these supplements may not be safe to take. it may be difficult to tell exactly what's in them. if you believe you have low testosterone or have male performance issues i suggest you consult a medical professional. he or she will treat your concerns with sensitivity and dignity. many of these problems can be effectively treated. and no: ""low-t"" is not an epidemic. men naturally produce less testosterone as they age. for some men this causes problem getting or sustaining an erection loss of libido and loss of energy. if you fall into this category you certainly may want to seek treatment because testosterone therapy has been shown to improve these symptoms. best wishes to you!"

you should use moisturizers that are non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging). for individuals with oily skin the use of products that clog pores may lead to increased oil production. oily skin needs special cleansing with plenty of warm water and soap to prevent the pores from being clogged. avoid harsh products that strip your skin of oil and encourage flakiness. they can cause a reaction known as reactive seborrhea where the oil glands work overtime to compensate for the loss of natural oils. avoid skin care products that leave your skin feeling taut and dehydrated. they cause the upper layers of the skin to shrink. this restricts oil flow through the pores leading to blockages and breakouts.	what kind of cream can i use to prevent excess oil?
not that your experience is normal but it is more common than you think. the first thing to do is check any new clothing detergent or soap that you use. these products can cause allergic-type reactions in some people. if you rule out detergent soap or any other lotions then you should consider a possible allergic reaction during exercise due to the release of histamines. it's not that you are allergic to exercise but rather that you may be experiencing a biological response during or after you work out that mimics an allergic reaction. here's what could be happening and why. during exercise histamines are released. histamines are proteins involved in autoimmune responses like an allergic reaction to pollen or dust. people who are sensitive to histamines can experience rashes itching and other allergic symptoms during exercise just like you are describing. most of the time the rashes appear on the chest and thighs but they can appear on the neck or arms too. sometimes exercise also reacts with food allergies or medications (for example antibiotics pain medications sedatives tranquilizers and diuretics) to cause the problem. the problem typically occurs more in cold weather than warm. if the problem bothers you so much that you can't stand it or it's not resolving on its own then you should ask your doctor about using a topical ointment to stop the itching or taking an over-the-counter antihistamine like benadryl 30-60 minutes before exercising. if over-the-counter antihistamines make you sleepy your doctor can prescribe a non-sedating antihistamine. you should not take over-the-counter or prescription medications for this problem without speaking with your doctor.	is it normal to break out in a very itchy rash all over my arms legs and abdomen after i work out?

i'm sorry to hear this. cellulitis can be very painful. i hope you're under the care and treatment of a doctor because cellulitis requires antibiotics to be cured. cellulitis is a bacterial infection that gets through the skin and into the underlying tissue areas. depending on how severe the case of cellulitis is a patient may receive oral antibiotics or have to go into the hospital for a course of intravenous (iv) antibiotics. unfortunately there's little you can do to help the swelling go down. you can try keeping the hand and wrist elevated which might help some. in terms of pain control please check with your health care provider to find out if it's ok for you to take over-the-counter pain relievers or if a prescription pain reliever may be in order. if the pain gets worse instead of better or if the swelling begins to move up your arm then you need to call your health care provider as soon as possible. this could be an indication you need more aggressive treatment. i wish you all the best!	i have cellulitis. my wrist is swollen and painful? what can i do?
first consider whether or not you're eating enough for dinner. what time do you eat dinner in relation to when you go to sleep? your urge to snack at night may be because you are still hungry from not eating enough for dinner. revisit how much you are consuming for dinner and make sure it’s a balanced meal including lean protein whole grains and vegetables. if you are still hungry for a snack at night try a cup of soothing chamomile tea with an oatmeal cookie (serving size not to exceed 100 calories). the tea will help you sleep and the cookies can be a good source of healthy fiber. or look for calorie-controlled non-fat frozen dairy desserts with servings that contain no more than 100 calories.	i have a hard time fighting my urge to snack at night. what is a good late-night snack to help kill my hunger?
the side effects of surgery are significant. you’re investing a lot up front with the highest risks up front for the potential long-term benefit 10 15 20 years down the road. the nerves that cause erections travel right alongside the prostate there’s the potential that those nerves could be injured. if that happens you could see problems with erections as far as quality or no erections at all. the great news is that with new techniques we can actually now preserve those nerves so that men have a much higher likelihood of having normal erections and with the medications that are now available the combination of the group surgery techniques and medications sexual dysfunction really should not be a major concern for prostate patients.	what are the side effects of prostate surgery?
the more we know about nutrition and health the more it seems we need to eat the way we did a hundred years ago. recent research is pointing us in the direction of eating mostly whole foods (foods in as close to its natural form as possible). consider the following whole food switches: *whole grains instead of refined grains whenever possible. *fruits vegetables and beans instead of a supplement containing fiber or vitamins. *a skinless chicken breast cooked with healthful ingredients instead of chicken nuggets made from processed chicken with added fats flavorings and preservatives. *a baked potato with chopped green onions and light sour cream instead of sour cream-and-onion potato chips. *fresh berries added to hot or cold whole grain cereal for a naturally sweet breakfast instead of berry-flavored pastries or breakfast bars. *a smoothie made with blueberries yogurt and frozen banana instead of a blueberry slush or flavored drink. eating more whole foods is one of the easiest routes to improving health and preventing disease. vegetables fruits whole grains nuts and seeds and legumes are great examples of foods that offer a powerful combination of important vitamins minerals fiber protein and antioxidants.	how can it eat more whole foods?
infections became more difficult to treat; we have to use agents that are more toxic and more expensive and we have to use them longer. the scariest situation is one we're seeing in hospitals in america where patients are acquiring infections and there are no antibiotic options. we have a disease that should be treatable and we now encounter situations where they are not treatable. in some cases it's taking us back to the pre-antibiotic period.	what could be the global consequences of antibiotic resistance?

there are a couple of ways to predict adult height for toddlers. the simplest way is to double the child's height at age 2. another trick is to look on a gender-appropriate growth chart for the child's height percentile at age 2 and then look at the height for that same percentile for age 18 years. lastly for boys you can add 5 inches to the mom's height and then average that number with the dad's height. for girls you have to subtract 5 inches from the dad's height and then average it with the mother's height.	can i predict my child's height?

male fertility is compromised by excessive free radicals generation (oxidative stress). oxidative stress leads to defective spermatogenesis/sperm formation. the antioxidant spermatogenic herbs are ashwagandha (withania somnifera) amalaki (emblica officinalis) kapikacchu (mucuna pruriens) gokshur (tribulus terrestris). these herbs in addition restore balance in hypothalamus-pitutary-gonadal (h-p-g) axis which further improves spermatogenesis.	which is the best herbal solution for men's fertility enhancing? . the number of couples unable to conceive is gradually increasing and most of the cases are due to infertility in the male partner. according to traditional herbal literature this herb is an adaptogen? . this means that adaptogens are very effective in terms of overcoming stress as well as stress-induced reactions.

the lack of intimacy can be very complicated so i think it would be good to address the issue as a couple during one of her counseling sessions. you may need to convince her to do this. the cause could be related to her depression of course but can also be related to her self-image. many antidepressant medications can affect libido so a review of her medications may be in order perhaps changing some of them to a type that does not have sexual side effects. you and your wife can rediscover sexual intimacy again but it may take time patience and some sexual counseling. don't give up on her or be frustrated. this can be fixed.

most condoms are made of a type of rubber called latex. latex condoms are the most effective condom at preventing stds. recently condoms made of polyurethane (a type of plastic) have become available. these are more expensive than latex condoms and seem to break more easily. they are mainly useful for people who are allergic to latex. there are also natural condoms which are made of animal membranes (lambskin). these are expensive and although they are effective at preventing pregnancy they do not decrease the spread of many sexually transmitted diseases.	what are male condoms made of?
well i am a little bit different in the respects that most doctors especially sleep specialists will say you should have no tv in the bedroom. i actually disagree. i have a select group of patients where they can’t turn their brains off and that’s why they have insomnia. if they could just watch some mundane television show to help them fall asleep they fall asleep very well. so what i tell people is if you’re going to fall asleep with the tv on just have a tv timer that will switch your tv off.	should i watch tv in bed if i have insomnia?

it does not take much force at all to crush the larynx. crushing the human throat takes roughly that same amount of pressure as crushing an empty soda container. this is why a move such as a throat gouge should never be used in a fight. the only time this kind of move should be used is if it is life or death. a hit to the throat can easily kill a person and is not to joked with. i hope this clears your doubts.	hi. my name is roberto writing from italy. i write here because i'd have a question i can't resolve in my hometown. let me introduce me: i'm a karate black belt and i like to study anatomy in order to be as more effective as i can. my question is about windpipe's rings resistance to pressure and/or strikes. in short i'd like to know how much it takes to crush/to flat trachea's cartilages with a sharp strike to the cervical part of the throat. thankyou for your attention and patience.

i understand you are worried. please do not worry. sinus tachycardia is just fast heart rate and yours is just slightly elevated. probably you were a little anxious during the time of the examination. st and t changes are often seen in normal healthy patients. it could be due to some medications. it is highly unlikely that you have any cardiac related issues at this age. but if you have experienced any chest pain of recent or shortness of breath then it could be a cause for worry. if you do have symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain then i will advise that you repeat the ekg test as a conclusion because it cannot be drawn from one ekg test result. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am a 30 year old female. Yesterday, I had an EKG for chest pain. My doctor said that my heart is great although my EKG automated interpretation was abnormal.

"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. my concern is that you don't have shingles at all. normally shingles isn't described as ""hives all over the body"" that ""itch. "" in fact if you have welts on both sides of your body (as divided by the spinal column) then i can guarantee you do not have shingles. shingles only affects one side of the body at a time. even though you don't currently have health insurance i'd suggest you find a way to get checked out by a medical professional preferably when you're having an outbreak of these hives. most communities have free or low-cost medical clinics to serve people who have no insurance. you can locate one of these clinics near you by calling your local medicaid office or by performing an internet search for ""free health clinic"" and your city name. i wish you all the best at finding a solution to this annoying condition!"

if you suspect you might have a blood clot you should make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. you have a good grasp of the primary symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) but just because you don't have the redness and heat doesn't mean it's not a dvt. of course pain in one calf muscle doesn't necessarily mean you do have a dvt either. generally dvt is first assessed using a non-invasive ultrasound test. this imaging test will give your doctor a good look at your veins to see if one of them may be blocked or partially blocked. if you do have a blood clot in your leg your doctor may treat it with medications. best wishes getting this sorted out! i had an ultra sound and it showed a blood clot.	how do i kinow if the pain in my calf is a blood clot? . i have had pain in the center of my calf for about 48 hours. it is not red or hot but the pain feels like a charlie horse that won't go away.
yes the tax penalty is small in 2014 but it will increase in subsequent years. one reason to have insurance is to protect you against a catastrophic event such as a car accident or a cancer diagnosis. without insurance something like that could push you into bankruptcy. in addition there are other benefits of insurance such as access to free preventive care coverage for prescription drugs and coverage for doctor's visits. if your income is low you should check with your state's marketplace/exchange because you may qualify for federal assistance to help you pay the premium.	what is the point of getting health insurance from the exchange since the tax penalty is so small? . i can't afford the monthly premiums any way.

there are problems with the fat burning option on the cardio machines and it really ought to be eliminated. the idea behind the fat-burning option is this: because fat is denser than carbohydrate it requires more oxygen to burn. so to maximize the percentage of fat you burn compared to carbohydrate the fat-burning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles. that generally means a slow pace to keep you from getting breathless. the problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed you burn fewer total calories -- from both carbohydrate and fat -- because you simply don't do as much work. further the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range (usually 60% to 85% of your maximum heart rate) which is hard to do at slower speeds. and fitness is ultimately what you're after whether your goals are better health burning calories or improving heart and lung capacity. the bottom line is that the fat-burning mode probably won't be intense enough to maximize total calorie- or fat-burning or to help you increase or maintain optimum fitness levels. use the cardio mode to maximize your exercise benefits. using the fat burning mode on exercise machines at the gym actually isn’t the best way to burn fat. the key concepts to understand here are the percentage of calories that come from fat and total calories. the fat burning mode is typically set at lower exercise intensity where more calories burned come from fat. not as many calories burned during higher exercise intensity will come from fat. the point to understand though is that while more of the calories that you burn will come from fat at a lower exercise intensity you have the potential to burn more calories per session doing higher exercise intensity. the percentage of calories burned from fat will be lower during the higher exercise intensity but you will be burning more calories overall including the amount of calories from fat. also higher exercise intensity leads to a greater boost in metabolism even after you’re done exercising which burns additional calories. it’s best to do exercise that you’re comfortable with and that meets your level of training/conditioning. in general however increasing the time spent on exercise and increasing exercise intensity will provide a greater potential to burn more calories and lose weight.	what's the difference between the fat-burning mode and the cardio mode on the machines at the gym?
good nutrition is important for strong bones and muscles. for people with lupus bone health is a particular concern. that’s because medications used to treat it can increase the risk for osteoporosis a condition in which the bones become less dense and break easily. eating foods high in calcium and vitamin d is important for bone health. when buying dairy products choose ones that are either low-fat or fat-free. good choices include: 1% or skim milk low-fat low-sodium yogurt low-fat cheese if you cannot drink milk good alternatives include: lactose-free milk soy milk almond milk juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin d dark green vegetables are another source of calcium. if you don’t get enough calcium in your diet your doctor will probably recommend a calcium supplement.	i have lupus. how can i maintain good bone health?

disinterest in sex is not uncommon but can be very complex. there can be many many different reasons -- impossible to sort out in the forum. if having a pleasurable sex life is important to you and i know that it is your first step would be to see your gynecologist to see if there is some organic reason for your lack of libido. the next step assuming a medical reason is not found would be to see a counselor -- a therapist that can help you uncover any psychological reasons for this issue. this problem can be fixed i am sure but you have to take the first step.	get bored having sex. sex has isn't very fun to me. it feels more like work than play. my boyfriend has been trying different things to help me but i just don't have fun. the first 5-10 minutes are fine but after that i'll hurry to fake an orgasm so he will ejaculate. he gets upset because he is always the one seducing me but the reason i don't seduce him is because i just don't like it! i don't know how to enhance my sex drive its really annoying.

a new study has found a direct link between sleep and the creation of long-term memories. scientists at washington university school of medicine have discovered a cluster of cells in the fruit-fly brain that controls sleep. by manipulating those cells scientists were able to establish long-term memories in fruit flies by controlling their sleep habits. using their ability to control the fruit flies’ sleep the scientists tested the insects’ ability to learn — and retain — information. here’s how they did it and what they found: as a test of learning researchers exposed male fruit flies to other male flies that had been engineered to smell like female fruit flies. after a few unsuccessful mating attempts the flies learned not to court these female-in-disguise flies. without sleep the fruit flies retained this knowledge of the pretend-female flies for a short period of time amounting to a few hours. scientists put their fruit-fly subjects to sleep after the courtship training. with sleep the fruit flies were able to retain the same information for several days. sleep enabled the fruit flies to convert short-term knowledge into long-term memory. we’ve long known that there was a relationship between sleep memory and learning. you don’t have to be a scientist to have a sense of this. think about your typical state of mind — and your inclination to retain new information — at the end of a long busy day. our brains use sleep as the time to determine what information can be discarded and what is useful enough that it should be stored as longer-term memories.	is there a link between sleep and long-term memory?

your nanny must not come into physical contact with your baby. that is the number one priority. technically it's contact with the weepy blisters of shingles that can cause an unvaccinated person to contract chicken pox but with a 10-month-old you don't want to take any chances. i would keep nanny separated from baby until the blisters have resolved. secondly you should speak to your pediatrician about getting your baby vaccinated. if you're concerned about the purported link between pediatric vaccinations and autism rest assured there is no link. there is absolutely no scientific evidence linking vaccines with autism -- but there is plenty of literature about the public health benefits of immunizing your children. the fact your child is now potentially exposed to varicella is a classic example of why children should be vaccinated. if you have questions about immunizing your child please have a long conversation with your pediatrician who can give you all the facts about it so you can make a truly informed decision. wishing you well!	my 10 month old child's nanny has shingles. what precautions should we take? my child is not vaccinated for chicken pox.

hcv is spread (transmitted) most efficiently through inadvertent exposure to infected blood. the most common route of transmission is needles shared among users of illicit drugs. accidental needle-sticks in health care workers also have transmitted the virus. the average risk of getting hcv from a stick with a contaminated needle is 1. 8% (range 0% to 10%). prior to 1992 some people acquired the infection from transfusions of blood or blood products. since 1992 all blood products are screened for hcv and cases of hcv due to blood transfusion now are extremely rare. hcv also can be passed from mother to unborn child. approximately 4 of every 100 infants born to hcv-infected mothers become infected with the virus. a small number of cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse. the risk of transmission of hcv from an infected individual to a noninfected spouse or partner without the use of condoms over a lifetime has been estimated to be 1% to 4% finally there have been some outbreaks of hcv when instruments or sharp tools have been reused without appropriate cleaning between patients. transmission of hcv can be prevented in several ways. programs have been aimed at avoiding needle sharing among drug addicts. needle exchange programs and educational interventions have reduced high-risk behaviors. however drug addicts are a difficult population to reach and rates of hcv remain high among addicts (30% of younger users). among health-care workers safe needle-usage techniques have been developed to reduce accidental needle-sticks. newer syringes have self-capping needle systems that avoid the need to manually replace a cap after drawing blood and reduce the risk of needle-sticks. there is no clear way to prevent transmission of hcv from mother to child. persons with multiple sexual partners should use barrier precautions such as condoms to limit the risk of hcv as well as other sexually transmitted diseases. monogamous couples should consider the low risk of transmission when deciding whether to use condoms during intercourse. some couples may decide to use them and some may not. screening tests for blood products have almost eliminated the risk of transmission through transfusion estimated by the cdc to be less than one in two million transfused blood products. people with hcv should not share razors or toothbrushes with others. it is critical that physicians and clinics follow manufacturer's directions for sterilizing/cleaning instruments and that disposable sharp instruments be discarded properly. it is important to realize that hcv is not spread by casual contact. thus shaking hands kissing and hugging are not behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. there is no need to use special isolation procedures when dealing with infected patients.	how is hepatitis c virus spread and how can transmission be prevented?
the most common way to treat epilepsy is with medication. specific drugs are prescribed depending on the type of epilepsy or seizure a person has. when medication doesn't work surgery is another treatment option. in some cases a surgeon can remove the area of the brain producing seizures or can interrupt the nerve pathways that signal seizures. for children a very strict meal plan called the ketogenic diet may reduce seizures. if a patient doesn't respond to medication and surgery is not an option vagus nerve stimulation can help prevent seizures. it works through a battery implant in the chest that delivers small pulses of electrical energy into the brain via the vagus nerve in the neck. the downside: it doesn't work for everyone and it is not approved by the fda for kids younger than age 12.	how is epilepsy treated?

first i do like to advice you to wait for the period if you do not see the period go for a home pregnancy test. a pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). however if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until 13 to 16 days after ovulation (the release of an egg) which is around the time that you would normally get your period. until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test. source :- pharmacysell	"could my girlfriend be pregnant? how early is too early for an accurate test? is spotting after a week late a good sign? . my girlfriend and i are in a long-distance monogamous relationship. over the 4th of july i went out to spend a few days with her and on the 4th we got a little too drunk and had unprotected sex. i pulled out but we all know that's hardly ""safe"" sex. . she was expecting her period anytime between thurs july 3rd to sat july 5th and as of today (july 11) there is still nothing and we are both more than a little freaked out. she has had no breast tenderness or fatigue and only some spotting."
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a form of epilepsy that starts in childhood or adolescence. people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy experience muscle twitching or jerking. they may also have other seizure types including full-blown convulsive seizures or absence seizures (staring spells). juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is among the most common forms of epilepsy. one of every 14 people with epilepsy have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. treatment with an epilepsy drug that works for multiple seizure types is usually effective.	what is juvenile myoclonic epilepsy?
im my opinion. your problem is about absorption. taking vitamin b12 supplement can help absorption from gut. proteins and soluble carbohydrates tend to improve copper absorption and bioavailability by enhancing its solubility and intestinal bulk flow. organic acids other than ascorbic acid or agents that form low-molecular-weight chelates are likely to have a positive effect on overall copper absorption.

celiac disease is suspected when individuals have signs or symptoms of malabsorption or malnutrition. other diseases however can produce malabsorption and malnutrition for example pancreatic insufficiency (a pancreas that is not able to produce digestive enzymes) crohn's disease of the small intestine and small intestinal overgrowth of bacteria. it is important therefore to confirm suspected celiac disease with appropriate testing. small intestinal biopsy small intestinal biopsy is considered the most accurate test for celiac disease. small intestinal biopsies can be obtained by performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (egd). during an egd the doctor inserts a long flexible viewing endoscope through the mouth and into the duodenum. a long flexible biopsy instrument is then passed through a small channel in the endoscope to obtain samples of the intestinal lining of the duodenum. multiple samples usually are obtained to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. a pathologist then can examine the biopsies (under a microscope) for loss of villi and other characteristics of celiac disease such as increased numbers of lymphocytes. small intestinal biopsy does however have some limitations. for example acute viral gastroenteritis and allergy to cow's milk or soy protein can cause abnormal small intestinal biopsies that are indistinguishable from celiac disease. however acute viral gastroenteritis is not easily confused with celiac disease because of the difference in the acuteness of symptoms. (acute viral gastroenteritis has a sudden onset of symptoms and last only a few days. ) it is however easier to confuse cow's milk and soy protein allergies with celiac disease but these allergic conditions are rare and primarily occur in young children. despite these limitations small intestinal biopsies are recommended even for individuals who have abnormal antibody tests for celiac disease specific antibody tests for celiac disease antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system to fight viruses bacteria and other organisms that infect the body. sometimes however the body produces antibodies against non-infectious substances in the environment (for example in hay fever) and even against its own tissues (autoimmunity). blood tests that are specific for celiac disease include endomysial antibodies anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-gliadin antibodies. in patients with celiac disease anti-gliadin antibody is an antibody produced against gliadin in the diet and endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are antibodies produced against the body's own tissues. endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are highly reliable in diagnosing celiac disease. an individual with abnormally elevated endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. anti-gliadin antibodies are less reliable and have a high false positive rate. thus a person with an abnormally elevated anti-gliadin antibody level does not necessarily have celiac disease. nevertheless anti-gliadin antibody levels are useful in monitoring the response to treatment because anti-gliadin antibody levels usually begin to fall within several months of successful treatment of celiac disease with a gluten free diet.	how is celiac disease diagnosed?

skin contains elastic fibers that allow it to stretch during weight gain or recoil or shrink during weight loss. so someone who gains a large amount of weight does not grow new skin. their skin stretches to accommodate the accumulation of fat tissue.	during weight gain does a persons skin streach or does it grow to accomodate the extra fat? . i am curious to know if a persons weight gain causes the skin to grow or to stretch. i am already aware that rapid weight gain can cause the skin the tear leaving stretch marks. i am asking more in regards to morbidly obese people that weigh around 400-700 pounds. i am curious to know if the skin actually can stretch that much or if the adult body is forced to grow the skin as it stretches.

yes. you can switch plans during medicare's annual enrollment period which runs from october 15th through december 7th each year. pre-existing medical conditions do not factor into your eligibility. the only exception to that is if you have original medicare and a medigap plan to help pick up costs medicare alone does not cover. after an initial enrollment period if you apply for a new medigap plan insurers can take the state of your health into consideration when deciding whether to sell you a plan and how much to charge. but if you have medicare advantage or want to switch your prescription drug plan (medicare part d) you can do that with no concern about pre-existing conditions as long as you do so during the open enrollment period.	can a person change medicare plans having preexisting conditions?

this is typically a problem called keratosis pilaris. this is a genetic problem that we see in people. it can just happen. sometimes you grow into it sometimes you grow out of it. but also i tend to see it in people who have either personal or family histories of asthma or allergies. it's not something that we can cure but we can help control it. using products like urea or lactic acid or exfoliants this can help smooth the skin and make it softer. so scratching and picking at it obviously will make it worse and will make it more red will make it likely to last longer. scrubs can help to some effect. retinoids have not been very effective for this but using products that are called keratolytics; something that will help the skin cells turn over more effectively can help it dramatically. for some people it's worse in the summer for some it's worse in the winter. you can sort of pick your season. if you are out in the summer and you have a short sleeve dress it's more important to try to treat it then and in the winter you can let it go if it doesn't bother you. but it's not a harmful condition it's more of a nuisance.	i get bumpy skin on the back of my arms. i have tried microdermabrasion scrubs but they don't wok. what can i do?

what you are describing is what i think a blood boil. most people get them like under the arm where you sweat are inside the leg near the scrotch or vagina area. and they can be very painful. my suggestion is to sit in a warm tub of water for as long as you can to get it soft do not put soap in it but put something like lysol the concentrated kind it will kill the germs and it will help as an disinfectant. it will keep the infection down;. it may break on its own and if it does it will have some pus and maybe some blood. in a tub a warm water as warm as you can stand it put about 2 capfuls of lysol only the kind that is concentrated it should come in a brown bottle. you might could find it in a drug store or in a grocery store where the laundry soap is found. but that is only a temporary fix. if it doesn't pop on its own then go to a doctor he will likely look and see exactly what it is and prescribe antibiotics to help it go away. i went to a doctor cause i had something similar and she popped mine and then she prescribed some medicine and then it went away and i have never had one since. so please seek treatment whatever you feel like is the best option and please let us know what you decide to do. i do hope that you get to feeling better and please keep us informed of your health. we do care and we want to help. thank you	painful 1 inch swelling between anus and scrotum not a pimple under the skin gives me fever help? . hi . i have a swelling between my scrotum and anus closer to the scrotum . it's size has increased in the last two days . i have had it for 4 days now it's excruciatingly painful. i have no idea what it is and what to do. . plus it gives me fever so i have taken small doses of paracetamol . it's still somewhat manageable if its kept warm. can you please tell what is it and how can i get better? ways to treat it? . any help would be really really appreciated! . thank you!

the keys to avoiding the condition depend on the type of hepatitis. many types of hepatitis can be prevented by making informed lifestyle choices. vaccinations are available for hepatitis a and b. adequate sanitation and clean personal habits will help reduce the spread of hepatitis a and hepatitis e. in areas where sanitation is questionable boil water. cook all food well and peel all fruit. health care workers or caregivers involved in the treatment of patients with contagious forms of hepatitis should wash their hands utensils bedding and clothing with soap and hot water. people planning to travel to countries where hepatitis is widespread are advised to have immune serum globulin shots or vaccinations before leaving. immune serum globulin may prevent infection from some types of hepatitis after exposure if administered within a certain timeframe. to prevent the spread of hepatitis b avoid exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. do not have intimate contact or share razors scissors nail files toothbrushes or needles with anyone who has the disease. if you suspect that you have been exposed to either hepatitis a or b you should receive immune serum globulin and vaccinations for the viruses as soon as possible. in the u. s. all children are advised to receive a hepatitis b vaccine before starting school. the hepatitis a vaccine is also recommended for children in areas with high prevalence of disease.	how can i prevent getting hepatitis?

"since i don't know how you were diagnosed (lab culture rapid strep test or just ""a look and see"" by your medical provider) penicillin remains the treatment of choice for treating true lab-diagnosed group a beta hemolytic strep (also known as strep throat). a z-pack is really not the appropriate dose for treating strep and i don't know the dose you received of the penicillin. i can say that failure of antibiotics often means that you (a) never had strep but a viral sore throat -- in which case no antibiotic would help (b) you were not treated appropriately either by dosage etc. for a lab-diagnosed case (c) you are a strep-carrier (this can be difficult to cure by oral antibiotics) or (d) you have mono/mononucleosis that clinically-mimicked strep throat -- in this case you need to have a lab test called an ebv panel to see if you have mono. either way you need to contact your medical provider -- the only one that can order any additional lab tests and/or treat you further."	i was diagnosed with strep throat and given penicillin for 7 days. it came back and now on zpac and it's not working. it came back a few days after antibiotic was done. i don't think zpac is the right antibiotic. what is the most effective antibiotic for a strep throat? .

most helpful answer you're right: since the duchess of cambridge was admitted to the hospital with hyperemesis gravidarum (hg) everyone's been asking what it really is. hyperemesis gravidarum literally means excessive (hyper) vomiting (emesis) due to pregnancy (gravidarum). many women get morning sickness -- nausea and/or vomiting -- in the early stages of pregnancy so a lot of people are asking why kate middleton had to be hospitalized for what amounts to a bad case of morning sickness. hyperemesis gravidarum however is a serious medical condition. a woman with hg may lose as much as 5% of her total body weight due to fluid loss. this can not only put the baby at risk but can cause electrolyte imbalances in the mother that can lead to a heart attack. fortunately hg is a very rare condition. most women never have morning sickness that reaches the level of hg. the duchess of cambridge was simply unlucky in this respect. hope that explains things for you.	what is hyperemesis gravidarum and is it similar or different to anything. basically having a hard time founding any useful info regarding all of this. besides what i have found regarding morning sickness nausea vomiting. especially in light that catherine (kate middleton) duchess of cambridge is currently suffering from it.

it depends on the bacteria that is causing the urinary tract infection. penicillin is not the preferred drug that is used for utis since it usually is not sensitive to the common bacteria usually bacteria that normally live in the colon (enteric bacteria). i have never treated a uti with penicillin. penicillin works great for strep so if the uti is caused by strep it could help but most of the time utis are other types of organisms that are resistant to plain 'ol penicillin. i am assuming you have not had a urinalysis or a urine culture. if you are self-diagnosing and self-treating a uti with an old prescription of penicillin i would strongly caution you against doing this. utis can quickly get out of hand if treated improperly and could end up involving the kidneys. diagnosing and treating a uti is best left up to a medical professional. yes it can	will penicilen cure an uti?

treatment of chronic hepatitis c varies depending on the individual. a person with chronic hepatitis c may not need or benefit from treatment. some people may not be able to tolerate treatment because of side effects. currently the fda has approved the following treatments for hepatitis c: pegylated interferon alfa-2a pegylated interferon alfa-2b ribavirin standard interferon alfa interferon is a naturally occurring protein that fights infection. injecting more interferon helps the body fight the hepatitis c virus. pegylated interferon is usually preferred as it only requires a single shot every week and has been found to be more effective. this is usually combined with ribavirin a medication that combats certain viruses and is taken orally in capsule form along with interferon. a third class of drugs known as protease inhibitors is awaiting approval by the fda. if approved these may be added to the existing combination in future treatments. this combination therapy usually lasts between 24 and 48 weeks. many people do not experience side effects when taking the treatment but it is possible you may feel fatigue and flu-like symptoms. your doctor may stop the treatment if you experience too many side effects. other common side effects of interferons include fatigue muscle pain headache nausea vomiting weight loss and depression and changes to your blood cell counts. side effects of ribavirin include anemia skin rash fatigue and nose/sinus congestion. prior to starting the treatment you may wish to organize medical leave or reduce working hours in case it makes you feel ill.	what treatments are available for chronic hepatitis c?

"this must feel very distressing. i hope to at least offer some reassurance. hair loss in women is not uncommon. that said i do think you should either return to your health care provider for follow-up testing or see a different doctor. the benefit of returning to the provider you saw last time is that he or she has your medical history and past test results for comparison. many conditions including thyroid issues can cause hair loss. just because they didn't show up on your lab work a year ago doesn't mean they won't show up now. you also should know that there is a condition called ""female pattern baldness"" that affects a number of women but this doesn't usually show up until a woman reaches her 40s. i wish you all the best in finding out why your lovely locks are falling out! i am 29 yrs old and have also been experiencing very thin hair embarrassing thin hair in the front and top of my scalp as well as lowered sex drive. i've had blood tests for thyroid and low hormones and all tests came back ""normal"" but i still feel there is a big unanswered question. i've also been told that stress and pain in the body can cause this so maybe life is stressing you out a bit more than you may be willing to acknowledge? i know i deny being stressed out! however i am searching for more concrete answers just like you so if you find any helpful information to share please do! sincerely cc from s. b. there are many reasons for hair fall. if you are sure that there are no serious underlying reasons like hormonal imbalances focus on nutritional aspect. hair nourishment with essential micronutrients through oral medicines and local applications (oils/creams) would help stop your hair fall."	my hair has been falling out for almost a year now. i'm 26 yr old female. my blood tests came back normal. along w/excessive shedding my hair has been very dry. i haven't changed the way i treat my hair. i do see growth but shedding is so excessive that my hair thinned considerably since last yr. i have used spironolactone for acne 2 1/2 yrs ago. i have been off it for a little over a yr. didn't experience any bad sideeffects w/spiro. i'm not on birth control. i also have been experiencing low sex drive. my gp didn't have an answer for me. i feel hopeless<negative_smiley>
a diet to help control diabetes is often individually prescribed -- based on body weight and lifestyle -- to help keep blood sugar levels in control. the best snacks for diabetics will contain some protein and some fiber to help slow down food absorption and therefore help control blood sugar levels and prevent spiking. avoid simple sugars such as in cookies and candies and choose whole grain crackers low-fat cheeses maybe a slice of turkey or leftover chicken. and pair these foods with a small amount of fruit if desired. know that fruit while healthy can be high in natural sugars that will spike blood sugar levels unless combined with a protein source to slow down their absorption in your body.	what kind of snacks would you recommend for people who are diabetic?

that's a good question. you'd think a stye would have cleared up by now. first off i would suggest seeing one doctor repeatedly instead of going from doctor to doctor. seeing the same doctor for a given condition offers continuity of care. perhaps you've been going to urgent care facilities where you don't get a choice of which doctor you see. if possible get set up with a primary care provider and get started on solving the stye problem. it's impossible to tell what's going on without performing a physical exam so the only advice i can give you is to go back to the doctor -- preferably the last one you saw for the condition. it's possible you've developed a second eye condition that has nothing to do with the stye. sometimes coincidences happen. wishing you well!	what if is it still draining after 4 months and 3 different scripts from 3 diff doctors? . i had a stye that ruptured 4 months ago. it is still draining enough so that my eye is matted up upon waking and i wipe my eyes constantly. what do i need to do to clear this up? i have seen 3 docs that have prescribed something different each time nothing has worked.

because people with the flu are contagious while they are ill and that they tend to be most contagious while they have a fever cdc advises people who are sick with flu to stay home and away from others for at least 24 hours until after their fever is gone (without the use of fever-reducing medicines). if a sick person is around others we advise that they cover their cough and everyone washes their hands frequently. most flu is spread directly from a sick person to another person. while flu viruses can be spread by surfaces contaminated with flu viruses (such as by coughing on them) this is probably not a very efficient way to spread the virus. studies have shown that human influenza viruses generally can survive on surfaces between 2 and 8 hours in usual conditions.	how long can the flu live in your home. my son has the flu how long until it is safe for my other children and grandchildren to come into my home?

i am guessing but i suspect that strawberry rhubarb reflects the appearance and color of the plant and has no botanic relationship to true strawberries. i have never heard of a genetic blending of those two very different plants. if your friend is the least bit concerned just ingest a very small amount of this rhubarb. have some benadryl on hand. and see what happens. or she can call her doctor or allergist for patient-specific advice should she be a person with a history of severe (anaphylactic) reactions. hi did grow this in the uk its just its name nothing to do with strawberry's. makes a nice home made wine get a nice kick. do hope this helps you. good luck	can someone with a strawberry allergy eat strawberry rhubarb? . i have a friend who is allergic to strawberries. i have a strawberry rhubarb plant and was wondering if has any strawberry properties or just the name for it?

there is some research to suggest that this may be true. but there is no conclusive evidence at this point. if you choose a high-protein diet you can help ease any possible effects on your bones by making sure you get plenty of calcium and vitamin d. dairy is your best bet for getting enough calcium especially vitamin d-fortified milk -- skim or low-fat. if you're not a big fan of dairy calcium and vitamin d supplements can be taken to help keep your bones strong. although high-protein diets are generally ok i hate to see people miss out on the fruits and vegetables that are so important for a healthy body. plus they're a great source of healthy carbs which your body needs for energy.	i've read a few articles that link the risk of bone loss in women to high protein diets. could this be true?
it depends on the degree of damage to the scalp. if you had a severe chemical burn there is a chance that it may not grow back. however if the bald spot resulted from traumatic pulling or friction -- such as from a hairpiece or a hair clip -- the hair may grow back just fine. see your dermatologist for intralesional injections of triamcinolone to help it regrow sooner. topical minoxidil may also help it regrow.	is it true that once you develop a bald spot due to some kind of damage the hair can never grow back on its own?

i would suggest that you see your medical provider so that you can have your rectum examined or have a flat-plate x-ray of your abdomen. no bowel movement for a week would seem to indicate a possible stool impaction but your comment about the anal area being obstructed concerns me that you could have a foreign body (do you think this is possible? ) or even a rectal prolapse. even if you are carefully examined a week ago it would be good to be re-examined. something is amiss.

it sounds like you need something to tone down your cough reflex. start with hot tea with honey but if that doesn't help something to thin your mucus secretions and lessen your cough reflex would help. simple tussin dm or it's generic that is something that includes dextromethorphan and guaiefenesin could help you. if that doesn't do anything either talk to the doctor. you might need a stronger cough syrup than you can get over the counter.	i have an exceptionally violent cough. whenever i have a cold or the flu or bronchitis or anything that causes a cough my cough is very very violent. sometimes it will induce my gag reflex and cause me to vomit. after a day or so it usually feels like i have been in a boxing match my chest and ribs are so sore. coughing so long and violently i can't get air sometimes. any possible answer on how to alleviate this would be appreciated.

first if you haven't already tried to objectively talk to him about his height for weight match start there. at 7 maybe showing him a growth chart (check on the cdc. gov website) and plotting his height weight bmi <link> and show him where he fits relative to the healthiest zones (for bmi between 5-85%iles is the lowest risk). second maybe there is some teasing going on at school or in the neighborhood that is giving him this inaccurate body image. societal and cultural pressures beyond the schoolyard and neighborhood might be at play as well. media messages about physical appearance are everywhere and are capable of influencing kids this young. we sure don't want the heathy eating and activity message to turn into an unhealthy drive for thinness. lastly could there be something more? maybe. if you can't seem to make any headway on changing your son's concerns about himself then maybe a check up with your doctor can be a way to see if there is something more.	how do i handle my 7 year old son that not only thinks he is fat (only 44 lbs) but also thinks that he is ugly?
shin splints is a condition where there is pain along the shinbone (tibia) resulting from too much stress on the tibia and the connective tissues particularly ligaments and tendons that attach the muscles in the lower leg to the bone. they can be caused by sudden increases in mileage walking or running uphill or downhill walking or running faster than normal jumping running stairs training for too long or too hard (overtraining syndrome) wearing poorly fitted or worn-out footwear or starting with too much exercise after a period of inactivity. they can occur on the medial (inside) of the shin or on the lateral (outside) of your shin. medial shin splints can be caused by excessive pronation or flat feet pounding from running or sports like tennis volleyball basketball and other weight-bearing activities particularly where you stop and start frequently. if you have medial shin splints and flat feet (excessive pronation) an orthotic device or over-the-counter arch support can sometimes be helpful for preventing shin splints. make sure it's a full-length insert. lateral shin splints (sometimes called anterior shin splints) are usually due to overuse and inflammation of the anterior tibialis muscle and the muscle compartment in the front of the leg along the outside front of your shin. the anterior tibialis muscle flexes your foot upward and individuals frequently get anterior shin splints from the repetition of flexing the muscle. for instance walking fast and/or uphill on a treadmill or increasing the speed or elevation substantially can overwork the anterior tibialis muscle and cause it to cramp. this can lead to shin splints or just a simple case of muscle cramping. it is difficult to stretch the anterior tibialis muscle to prevent shin splints. you can try to stretch the muscle by sitting and crossing your leg so your ankle is resting on the other knee and pulling on your foot (as if you are pointing your toe). this may or may not have an effect. massage of the anterior muscle while in this position may also be helpful. occasionally stretching the calves can help (the gastrocnemius muscle). to do that: (1) stand facing a wall (2) lean against the wall with both arms and elbows slightly bent (3) bring one leg forward with the knee bent (4) keep the other leg straight with the heel on the floor and (5) lean the hips toward the wall while keeping your back straight. another stretch that might be helpful is for the soleus muscle which is low in the calf. to do that: (1) do the standard calf stretch as described (2) while in the stretched position bend the back knee slightly and (3) you will feel this lower on the leg (just above your achilles tendon). hold all stretches until you feel looser. to strengthen the anterior tibialis: (1) sit on the floor (2) tie an elastic exercise band around the leg of a table or chair and then wrap it over your toes (3) pull on the band by flexing your foot and (4) repeat 10 times for three sets. to strengthen the calves do heel raises: (1) while standing rise up on your toes (2) slowly lower to the floor and (3) repeat 10 times for three sets. you can also do heel raises by standing on the edge of a step with your heels hanging off for greater range of motion (your heel drops lower than the step). stop these exercises if you have pain. the best prevention for shin splints is to find out what is causing it (for example overuse flat feet etc. ) and fix that problem. for example if you are overtraining then cut back; if you use the treadmill at the same speed and elevation all the time then vary it; if you have flat feet then an insert or prescription orthotic may be helpful; if you do impact sports then take a break and cross-train with lower-impact activities like biking; if your shoes fit poorly or are worn out then get new shoes. shin splints can be persistent and so if they continue you ought to see your doctor for a proper referral to either an orthopedist or podiatrist. your doctor will know what type of referral you need.	are there any exercises or stretches i can do to prevent shin splints?

most helpful answer everything i have read says cold. if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal. heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed. this is to increase circulation and promote healing. more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone-like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body. so if you can move do. lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery. the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re-construct those damaged tissues. this information is from exercise physiology. ice is typically among the first thing to do in the recovery process after strenuous exercise. icing your muscles helps to reduce pain and decrease swelling and inflammation. ice causes your blood vessels to narrow which will reduce your blood flow to the muscle or injured area. never place ice directly on your skin however. wrap an ice pack around a thin cloth and place on the affected muscle for ten minutes at a time. you can use ice multiple times per day for a few days after exercise but make sure to allow for your skin to return to room temperature before icing after each 10 minute interval. heat is typically applied to uscles or injuries that do not have swelling or inflammation. heat will cause your blood vessels to expand which improves circulation and allows more blood to go to the affected area. heat can be useful for chronic injuries and muscle soreness or it can be used before exercise to stimulate blood flow and help prepare the muscle for exercise. heat should also not be directly applied to skin and should be used for short 10-15 minute intervals. always check with your doctor before starting treatment of an injury especially if the condition worsens or fails to improve. within the first few days of an injury ice can help the process of healing. applying ice to injured tissue can cause blood vessels to shrink and this makes them less capable of releasing chemicals that lead to swelling inflammation and pain. after a few days it probably best to apply heat to sore muscles. this makes muscle spasms less likely and relaxes injured muscles. however because the events behind every injury are different speak with your doctor first. i have just spent the last 6 weeks in physical therapy. they always apply heat or have me get on a bike to heat up my muscles for 15 minutes before i go through any table massage work. next i do all my exercises then they end the session with 10 minutes of ice. somtimes what contributes to soreness is 1) lack of warm-up so insuffcicient oxygen was available to fuel the work. and 2) lack of cooldown which will help the muscles recover by completing any partial combustion of sugars for energy leaving residual metabolites such as one feels with the muscle burn of working beyond anerobic threshold. anerobic threshold can be increased through more careful training. i can exercise well beyond my predicted 100% of age heart rate for periods of 10 20 and 30 minutes or more	is it better to apply heat or cold to sore muscles after stenuous exercise?
yeast can most definitely irritate the urethra if you have a vaginal yeast infection. use a topical yeast cream and smear on this area as well; this can even be mixed with some 1% hydrocortisone cream to help with the irritation. it is not likely to travel up your urethra but it can definitely irritate this delicate tissue.	can a vaginal yeast infection irritate the area around the urethra? . i was recently treated in the er for a severe infection from a finger injury that was speading up to my wrist. i was given 2 antibiotic injections and home course of two oral antibiotics. within a few days i began showing vaginal swelling irritation and itching. after finishing the pills i have the typical yeast discharge and the area around the urethra is red swollen and tender. can this cause other problems and travel up the urethra?

the income used to figure out if you are eligible for a subsidy is your modified adjusted gross income (magi). that means your household income after deductions and other credits. for most people magi will be the same as adjusted gross income or agi. you can find your agi on line 4 if you file taxes on a 1040 ez form line 22 on form 1040a and line 38 on form 1040.	there are two different definitions of wages. the federal and state of florida. . unemployment insurance in florida counts dividends and wages as wages. this is unlike the federal government that splits the two. so what is our wages when determining your subsidy for health insurance?

"this is a difficult question to answer because you don't mention what your daughter's age is -- and it makes a big difference. if your daughter is under 3 months of age and has a fever you need to seek immediate medical attention (even though she's been seen twice in two days). high fever in a newborn always deserves intervention. if your child is between 3 months and 4 years of age a fever of up to 104f is not uncommon and may last 3-4 days. treat this in whatever manner your doctor told you. sometimes pediatricians recommend acetaminophen (tylenol) for this type of fever. if your child is over age 4 you can use webmd's "" check your symptoms "" tool to determine a course of action. any fever over 106f in any age person deserves immediate medical attention. at home you can apply cool compresses to the forehead and back of the neck and if given the ok by your pediatrician use acetaminophen (tylenol) to help reduce the fever. wishing you both all the best!"	my daughter has the flu & been seen by a doctor 2 x in 2 days but she is still running a high fever what should i do?

"loss of blood supply to portions of the brain can occur for a variety of reasons. a blood vessel can get blocked and blood supply to a part of the brain is lost or a blood vessel leaks blood into the brain (brain hemorrhage). most commonly the blood vessel is blocked. the blockage can be caused by a blood clot that forms in the blood vessel (thrombosis) or it can be caused by a clot or debris that floats downstream (embolus). atherosclerosis or ""hardening of the arteries"" can cause fatty plaque formations in the blood vessel wall. the plaque can rupture and cause a small blood clot to form and occlude the blood vessel. a blockage can also occur when debris from narrowing of a carotid artery breaks off and floats downstream to cause the occlusion. sometimes in people with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation small blood clots can form and travel to the brain to cause the obstruction. brain hemorrhage or bleeding in the brain can be due to an aneurysm a weak spot in a blood vessel that ruptures and spills blood into the brain tissue or it may be due to spontaneous bleeding caused by poorly controlled hypertension (high blood pressure). such bleeding more commonly results in a true stroke as opposed to a tia."	what are the causes of transient ischemic attack or tia?
scientists aren't sure what causes migraines including migraines without aura. it's thought that at least two brain chemicals -- serotonin and dopamine -- play a role. the theory is something goes awry in the way these chemicals regulate brain function. this causes the brain and the body's immune system to overreact. when that happens a flood of immune response cells flows through the blood vessels to the brain. the brain's blood vessels open wider to accommodate these cells. then even more chemicals are released to help control the vessels' muscles. the vessels open and constrict. a severe sometimes throbbing headache results. factors suspected of causing migraines include genetics and being overweight. substances behaviors and environment may also trigger migraines. it is known that migraines often run in families. they frequently begin in childhood and worsen through adolescence. although more boys than girls have migraines more adult women than adult men have migraines. over time the number of migraines lessens. migraines become rare after age 50.	what causes a migraine without aura?

"many factors contribute to crow's feet including sun exposure squinting and menopause. solar radiation damages the elastic and collagen in your skin which leads to ""lax skin"" rather than tight skin that is adherent to the underlying muscles. sun exposure is probably the easiest to address. you should incorporate sunblock in your daily skin regimen. squinting results in contraction of the muscles around the eyes. years of squinting can lead to hypertrophy or enlargement of the underlying muscles which will lead to the noticeable grooves on the skin surface. menopause affects estrogen levels which is critical for maintaining collagen levels and skin hydration."	is there a product i can use or something i can do to help make my crow's feel less noticeable?

sorry you had breast cancer. i like the tram flap approach. it's a great reconstructive method in my opinion. i'm a little confused because you state you have an open wound in your abdomen. this is a not-uncommon complication of tram flap surgery. if the wound is still healing i would suggest you consult your surgeon about this hardened tissue. it could be many other things besides scar tissue. until all of your wounds have healed completely you probably shouldn't take any action toward scar reduction. that can wait until you're all healed up. i wish you all the best!	how to soften internal scar tissue. i had a transflap surgery due to mastectomy and have harden tissue around an opened wound in my abdomen. how can i soften it?
hi what is below is from webmd may help calm you down as what you may have had was just some warts ordanair but see what you think. hpv and childbirth the risk of hpv transmission to the baby during childbirth is very low. even if babies do get the hpv virus their bodies usually clear the virus on their own. most of the time a baby born to a woman with genital warts does not have hpv-related complications. in very rare cases a baby born to a woman who has genital warts will develop warts in the throat. this serious condition is called respiratory papillomatosis and requires frequent laser surgery to prevent the warts from blocking the baby's breathing passages. and even if the mother has a type of hpv virus that has caused cervical cancer the baby can be delivered safely. do hope this helps you. good luck	hpv before sexually active? . i know that hpv can be spread from your mother during birth but my question is did that happen to me? so basically since i was really young i had a wart on my right thigh and as i got a bit older they started to grow on my right arm. my mother told me it was from resting my elbow and arm on my thigh and that contact spread them. but i also had one on my finger and down there. on my outer labia. but one year they all vanished randomly. could that have been hpv?

most helpful answer i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. it sounds quite unpleasant! unfortunately it's impossible to answer your question in a forum like this because diagnosing the problem requires a physical examination. i suggest you consult your primary healthcare provider for an exam. that said the situation doesn't sound dire. a lump in the area you describe would probably be a nodule in the skin such as a fatty cyst. of course if you're talking about a lump on the ribcage near breast tissue then this would be a concern. but i'm reading your question as a lump underneath the bottom of your ribcage on the left side. at any rate a trip to the doctor is in order to get some answers. wishing you well!	i have a lump under my lower left rib that sometimes causes pain. what is it?
my advice would to buy another test if you don't start soon. sometimes you can get a false negative when you take an otc test. even if it's still negative you should go see your ob to be on the safe side. when i was pregnant with my daughter i took 4 test and they all came back negative. i went to see my ob and found out i was 9 weeks pregnant. my ob told me that some of the meds i was on were what was causing the test to come back negative. so it's worth a trip to the ob to be on the safe side if you don't start soon.	im worried i might be pregnant i was only spotting yesterday and then it stopped i took a test and it was negative

this very important medical exam component is usually performed standing with the medical provider sitting on a stool. the underwear can be pulled down if the patient is not completely disrobed and wearing a gown. the provider should be wearing gloves. the exam in painless only takes a few minutes checking for inguinal hernias or scrotal or testicular masses. there should be an educational component about self-examination for testicular masses and of course ample time should be provider to address any private questions that the young man may have at the time. the exam is done in private and if possible a same-sex clinician can be requested if the young man is shy.	how are young men's genital exams performed - with the patient standing or supine? underwear on or off? wearing gloves?

there are strong arguments to be made both in favor and against using artificial sweeteners in my opinion. one thing that is easy to agree upon is that there we could benefit from stronger scientific data on the long-term effects of artificial sweeteners on the body. the lack of strong data helps fuel the debate in my view. the argument in favor of artificial sweeteners goes something like this: excess sugar is unhealthy. when added to foods and beverages it encourages overeating and has negative health effects that help fuel diabetes heart disease and associated risk factors even in the absence of obesity. for example drinking one can per day of regular soda is associated with nearly a doubling of the risk of type 2 diabetes. since we are going to be eating sweet foods it makes sense to find healthier ways to sweeten food if possible. saccharin (sweet-n-low sugar twin) aspartame (nutrasweet equal) acesulfame k (sweet one sunett swiss sweet) neotame and sucralose (splenda) are currently approved by the fda for this use. extensive testing has demonstrated no evidence of toxicity or negative short-term health effects. years of experience with these products has not demonstrated any clear signs of trouble. moreover the availability of the “diet” version of sodas and other artificially sweetened foods helps people avoid the higher sugar alternatives and to maintain caloric reductions and weight loss. in patients with diabetes the availability of artificial sweeteners can help control blood sugar when used to reduce sugar intake. artificial sweeteners have been blamed by various individuals for many types of medical symptoms (such as headaches) but scientific studies attempting to find an association with any symptom typically fail to confirm any relationship with artificial sweeteners. even if a small minority of individuals are truly sensitive to certain artificial sweeteners that would not necessarily be a good reason to discourage others from using them. furthermore some would argue that even if artificial sweeteners have minor health risks that would not necessarily offset their potential benefits. the argument against artificial sweeteners goes something like this: as a general principle humans and other animal species are genetically designed to eat foods that occur in nature and artificial sweeteners do not fit this criterion. obviously not everything that is natural is healthy but one should assume that chemicals that do not occur naturally are not fit for human consumption. anyone who argues otherwise should be required to prove that a specific artificial chemical is safe for long-term consumption and the scientific methods available at this time are not sufficient to be confident that such artificial substances are truly safe. a small but growing body of scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that non-caloric sweeteners stimulate food intake obesity diabetes and related diseases. as summarized on the harvard school of public health website the concern is that sweetness in the absence of calories is unnatural and may stimulate hormonal changes that encourage overeating. non-conclusive studies suggest that people who drink diet soft drinks are at increased future risk of obesity and are more likely to have type 2 diabetes than people who avoid diet (and sugar-sweetened) beverages. for these reasons and others some specialty grocery chains such as whole foods do not carry any foods with artificial sweeteners or other artificial ingredients. their position may reflect a popular philosophy that that sugar derived from natural sources is the lesser evil compared to artificial sweeteners. natural sweeteners such as stevia and erythritol and other sugar alcohols are typically welcomed by those who are concerned about both sugar and artificial sweeteners. however they do not provide a perfect solution either due to taste limitations and they may raise the same concerns about sweetness in the absence of calories discussed above. finding an elusive middle ground: so what is the most prudent approach to sweeten foods and beverages? it is impossible to build a consensus around this topic. all approaches have limitations and concerns. sugar tastes the best but is clearly unhealthy when used to excess. stevia and sugar alcohols seem the least risky but have taste limitations. artificial sweeteners may represent a middle ground depending on the degree to which one believes they are safe versus risky and data are inconclusive and sparse.	what are the pros and cons of artificial sweeteners?

fevers are common in young babies and can usually be easily resolved with proper medical diagnosis of their cause and appropriate treatment is administered. although you do not want to panic over a slight fever these febrile babies need to be observed closely. the situation can go from only having a small spike in body temperature to bad to worse very quickly. this is due in part to their small body size immature immune system and the potential to loss body fluids. it would be helpful to know the age of your baby the range of body temperature readings that you've obtained whether the baby is accepting fluids and other nutrition and how long that the baby has had the fever. it sounds like your child is fighting off some type of viral or bacterial infection. fevers that last longer than 24 hours in young children without going down or are higher than 100. 4 degrees rectally in an infant < than 3 months old should be evaluated by a medical professional immediately. teething alone should not cause a temperature to reach the 100. 4 degree level. perhaps the yeast infection is not responding to the ointment and a systemic antibiotic is needed. or maybe another more serious infection exists. when in doubt as is the case with your child always notify your doctor of a fever in a baby that is not responding to treatment. i would call your pediatrician without delay and inform that individual of the baby's condition. if that is not possible a visit to your local hospital's emergency room is justified. the message here is. it is better safe than sorry when dealing with a sick baby. i hope that your baby gets well soon.	should i take my baby to the doctor if the fever keeps coming back? . she is currently teething and has a yeast infection. i keep giving her tylenol and ibuprofin but when it wears off the fever comes back. she is on a special ointment for her infection.

doctors can use several types of medicine to treat paget's disease. although it is not possible to cure paget's disease with them they can make the disease inactive and may reduce complications. medicines such as bisphosphonate and calcitonin slow the breakdown and rebuilding of bone tissue. you can use over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or other pain medicines to treat bone pain. medication choices medicines that slow the breakdown and rebuilding of bone tissue include: bisphosphonates which are usually the first medicines used to treat paget's disease. calcitonin which is usually given by injection. your doctor probably will prescribe calcitonin if you cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or if they have not been effective in treating your symptoms. what to think about you may need to take medicine for several weeks before symptoms of paget's disease improve. some medicines control the disease and its symptoms only while the person is taking the medicine. soon after the medicine is stopped symptoms may come back. your doctor may recommend medicine for paget's disease even though you have no symptoms. medicines prevent the rapid breakdown of bone tissue and may decrease the chance of complications of paget's disease. an oral bisphosphonate such as alendronate ( fosamax ) or risedronate ( actonel ) generally is used first. if the side effects are too much for you you can try intravenous pamidronate ( aredia ) or zoledronic acid ( reclast ). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat pagets disease of bone?

some red meats are high in saturated fat which raises blood cholesterol and increases the risk of heart disease. researchers say eating red meat also raises the risk for some cancers especially colorectal. “the association between consumption of red and processed meats and cancer particularly colorectal cancer is very consistent ” says marji mccullough phd a nutritional epidemiologist with the american cancer society. red meat has its benefits: it is high in iron something many teenage girls and women in their childbearing years are lacking; it supplies vitamin b12 which helps make dna and keeps nerve and red blood cells healthy; zinc which keeps the immune system working properly; and it provides protein which helps build bones and muscles. the american institute for cancer research a nonprofit that focuses on cancer prevention through diet and physical activity advises no more than 18 ounces of cooked red meat a week.	does red meat cause heart disease or cancer?

in general i would say this is nothing to worry about. in fact every person's bowel habits are different. if what you describe has been going on for some time it may simply be normal for you. the color and consistency of our stool (bowel movements) can tell us a lot about our general health. you should be concerned if: you notice your stool is black or tarry. if so contact your doctor for an appointment right away. (unless you've recently been taking pepto-bismol which is known to turn the stool black. ) you notice your stool is white or extremely pale. if so contact your doctor right away. white stool can indicate an absence of bile. you experience watery unformed stool that continues for days (diarrhea). sometimes diarrhea results from food poisoning and will get better on its own. for adults with chronic diarrhea (meaning every bowel movement is watery not just once a day or once in awhile) a trip to the doctor would be in order to determine the cause. you experience frequent episodes of extremely hard stool that requires straining to push out. this type of stool can indicate you're not consuming enough fiber. try to increase your intake of raw vegetables and fruits to prevent hard stools. if you experience an occasional hard stool try drinking prune juice. believe it or not smelly stools actually are a good thing. the odor is caused by all the bacteria that live in the gut. and it seems the more bacteria you have the stinkier your bowel movements may be. i hope this helps!	are soft stools once a day a reason to worry they happen after i eat first waking up if i don't eat i won't go.
let me try to help you out here. you ask a very good question. first let me tell you i know of no link between use of sanitary pads and ovarian cancer. perhaps the person who told you that was thinking of toxic shock syndrome which can occur when women use super-absorbent tampons and do not change them frequently enough. because you use pads toxic shock syndrome is not a major concern for you. for purely hygienic purposes i'd recommend changing your pad every four to five hours no matter how saturated it may be. the same goes for panty liners when used toward the end of your period when the flow is very light. changing pads fairly frequently will help you feel cleaner and avoid any odor problems. i hope this answers your question!	when to replace a sanitary pad during periods? . if a pad does not get saturated after many hrs than it should be replaced or not? i need to know the time/ hrs after a pad should be replaced because i've heard that a pad should be replaced after 5 hrs otherwise it can cause ovarian cancer because blood mix with gel & make a substance that is harmful i want to know is that true?

commonly hfm is an illness of children less than 10 years of age; adults generally were exposed during childhood and maintain a natural immunity. information regarding fetal exposure to hfm during pregnancy is limited. no solid evidence exists that maternal enterovirus infection is associated with complications such as spontaneous abortion or congenital defects. however should a baby be born to a mother with active hfm symptoms the risk of neonatal infection is high. typically such newborns have a mild illness. rarely overwhelming infection involving vital organs such as liver heart and brain can be lethal.	how does hand foot and mouth disease affect pregnancy and the baby?

the short answer is this: if your doctor put you on this regimen then he or she feels it's safe. if you're concerned about this pain control regimen for some reason then i'd suggest you make an appointment with your doctor to discuss the situation. your health care provider can explain why he or she feels this is a good regimen for you. you as the patient have the right to expect a full explanation of your medication regimen from your health care team and to have your concerns heard. if you don't feel your doctor is responding appropriately to your concerns then you may feel free to get a second opinion. you deserve a doctor or nurse practitioner or physician assistant who listens to your concerns and responds appropriately. i hope this helps! no it is not. the reason is that vicodin has 500mg of tylenol per pill already. vicodin also has hydrocodone which is safer on your body than ibuprofrin or asprin. i also have arthritis and ruptured discs and took oxycontin and vicodin for 6 years with no problems. its when i quit the narcotics and started taking high doses of ibuprofrin and tylenol that i started crapping blood due to stomache bleeding-- due to ibuprofrin. narcotics are addictive but so is tacobell! at least the oxy didnt rip holes in my stomache. and now im off the oxy and i can tell you there not as addictive as everyone will tell you. i took 180mg per day for 6 years. and now i dont. so the point is narcotics are always your best bet for pain. they are way more effective and less harmful! and no one is ever going to tell it to you straight like i am doing now! good luck	is it safe to take 1000 mg tylenol 500 mg ibuprofen and 675 mg of aspirin 4-5 times a day? . i'm 56 years old and i've had two strokes. i have pain in my knees lower and upper spine (due to damage) and arthritic pain in various joints. i also tend to get sinus headaches almost daily. in other words i am in constant pain some days (cold & damp) worse than others. my doctor has me taking 1000 mg acetominaphen 500 mg ibuprofen and 675 mg aspirin 4 to 5 times a day. is this safer than taking 5 mg vicodin 4-5 times a day?

there are two types of sinusitis : acute (sudden onset) and chronic (long-term). sinusitis often develops after a cold or viral infection. most sinus infections improve on their own but sometimes they develop into a bacterial infection -swelling inflammation and mucus production caused by the cold can lead to blockage in the nasal passages which may encourage the growth of bacteria. acute sinusitis whether viral or bacterial may develop into chronic inflammation or infections that may last 8 weeks or longer. chronic sinusitis can lead to permanent changes in the mucous membranes that line the sinuses. as a result of these changes you may become prone to having more sinus infections that may become more difficult to treat. complications of sinusitis (such as an infection of the facial bones called osteomyelitis ) are relatively rare. but when complications occur they may be life-threatening and often require extensive medical or surgical treatment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get sinusitis?

having taught in the field i can assure you that it is both weights and cardio or aerobics. lifting weights doesn't burn as many calories as aerobics at the time you do it. however as you gain strength your metabolism increases so you burn more calories 24/7. as you increase your strength you will also burn more calories during aerobic exercise. both are important from a health standpoint. cardio is important for prevention of heart disease stroke diabetes and many other conditions. strength is important in reducing the affects of aging. as we age we loss muscle mass but a good strength program can reduce the loss. much of the reason we think we have to discontinue activities we once enjoyed is because of loss of muscles mass and reduction of aerobic capacity. while sit-ups help to strengthen abdominal muscles which helps prevent the common causes of back pain they do not help you lose belly fat. when you lose fat you lose it all over. however as with everything genetics comes into play in our lose of fat also. the other equation in the mix is food intake. without attention to a healthy diet and serving sizes you won't lose as much and will lose some of the benefits of exercise.	is aerobics a good exercise to loose fat in belly?
well unfortunately there are not many options that are available for a pregnant woman when they are having a cold. but by talking to the pharmacist we might be able to actually recommend some products that might actually assist in the symptom relief. we are going to ask the patient though how far along they are in their pregnancy and maybe whether they tried in the past and have they spoken to their ob/gyn or healthcare professional to see if they had actually recommended any specific products for them to use? for things like nasal congestion. simple saline spray or drops will help loosen that up and help them breath a little better. they can also use things like a vaporizer or a humidifier at night while they are sleeping including a medicine cup in that vaporizer with a little vicks vaposteam will actually help decongestant through the night as well. and elevating their head not lying flat down on the bed will assist in that too. a little vicks vaporub is fine to rub on a pregnant woman it's safe and it does work and helps clear the breathing a little bit. but once again that we really need to talk to the patient find out what their symptoms are and make sure that they are being referred back to their doctor or healthcare provider for further treatment if they seem that they are getting worse it could be more signs of infection or something like that.	what can you take for a cold during pregnancy?

these products are actually commonly found in the weight loss teas and they may help a little bit in the first few days. you may think that you have lost a little weight but other than that there is no proof or efficacy that they work at all. and if you are allergic to things like ragweed and pollen you want to stay away from these type of products because of the dandelion component. you could actually have an allergic reaction to it. so once again read the labels see what's inside the product. if you have any questions about it come and talk to the pharmacist because we're finding out more and more the people are getting reactions to these type of medications because of the fact that they didn't know what was in it or they didn't know that they were allergic to a component of it. so once again keep that in mind and talk to your pharmacist doctor or healthcare provider.	dandelion guarana and other herbal diuretics are they safe and will they help my weight loss?
"the short answer to your question is: no. currently there is no cure for tinnitus unless it's caused by a curable underlying condition (such as taking too much aspirin). tinnitus (or ""ringing in the ears"") can be more than annoying. it can become a debilitating problem in which the ""noise in the ears"" can drown out other sounds including a loved one's talking. if you believe you have tinnitus start with a visit to your primary care provider for an evaluation. you may be referred to a hearing specialist. while medication are available to treat tinnitus many people rely on masking devices that sort of ""counteract"" the interior noise of tinnitus. there's also a new hearing aid available that both amplifies sound and masks the tinnitus noise. wishing you well!"	does lipo flavonoid reduce or cure tinnitus?

basically anytime that you have unprotected sex (the condom broke) you are capaple of getting pregnant however there are only a few days every month that you are ovulating. two days before your period is not the time you would be expected to ovulate so if you have a predictable regular cycle you are not likely going to get pregnant from this one isolated mistake. however if there were other mistakes in the last month or so then anything is possible. wait another week or so and take another home pregnancy test or see your medical provider for a more accurate pregnancy test and exam.	can i be pregnant if i had sex two days before my expected period? . i had sex two days before my expected period. we used a comdon but it broke. he pulled out. i am now four days late and have been spotting for the last 3 days. its not stress because i am not stressed. in the last four days i gained 4lbs and been nauseous. i took a pregnancy test once and it was negative. could i still be pregnant?

i think probiotics are fine and not harmful over the long term. as you know they contain friendly yeast and bacteria that are normally found in the body's intestines; called normal flora. they do not contain harmful or potentially dangerous mixtures of organisms. if there is an imbalance in our normal flora probiotics can help correct the problem especially with candida overgrowth. the body will basically incorporate whatever it needs from the probiotic pills to rebalance the flora. if we have chronic problems then regular probiotics may be needed and helpful. if we are balanced and still take probiotics that may not be needed at that time the body should simply pass it through with no harm done. if my patients feel they help i have no problem if they continue taking probiotics.	is it safe to take probiotics long-term?

couples should consider seeing a doctor if they have been trying to conceive for a year without success (6 months for women over 35). the beginnings of a fertility evaluation focus on eggs tubes and sperm. with regards to eggs your doctor will want to confirm that you are releasing your egg and determine how many eggs remain. signs that you are releasing an egg are regular predictable menstrual cycles positive ovulation predictor kits shifts in basal body temperature and/or a high progesterone level approximately one week before your period. ovarian reserve the number of eggs remaining in the ovary can be evaluated with blood tests (fsh amh) and ultrasound for antral follicle count. fallopian tubes can be evaluated by a hysterosalpingogram an x-ray test where x-ray dye is injected into the cervix. the x-ray shows the cavity of the uterus and whether the tubes are open. sperm are evaluated with a semen analysis to look for sperm number and motion. if a semen analysis is not normal it will be repeated to rule out normal fluctuations. if it is normal either the first or second time no further evaluation is needed. if it is abnormal twice you will be referred to urology for further evaluation. the next steps in fertility evaluation and treatment will be based on results to the above tests. while these tests can identify some fertility factors mother nature is more complex. occasionally all the tests will be normal despite a continued delay to pregnancy. therefore your doctor will discuss fertility treatment in the context of the evaluation you have completed.	when should we consider a fertility evaluation and what is involved?

the exact cause of penile cancer is not known but there are certain risk factors for the disease. a risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. the risk factors for cancer of the penis may include the following: uncircumcision. men who are not circumcised at birth have a higher risk for getting cancer of the penis. human papilloma virus (hpv) infection. hpv includes more than 100 types of viruses that can cause warts (papillomas). certain types of hpv can infect the reproductive organs and the anal area. these types of hpv are passed from one person to another during sexual contact. smoking. smoking exposes the body to many cancer-causing chemicals that affect more than the lungs. smegma. oily secretions from the skin can accumulate under the foreskin of the penis. the result is a thick bad-smelling substance called smegma. if the penis is not cleaned thoroughly the presence of smegma can cause irritation and inflammation. phimosis. this is a condition in which the foreskin becomes constricted and difficult to retract. treatment for psoriasis. the skin disease psoriasis is sometimes treated with a combination of medication and exposure to ultraviolet light which may increase a person's risk for penile cancer. age. over half of the cases of penile cancer occur in men over age 68.	what causes penile cancer?

the single worst thing you can do to a pimple is pick. these are not surgical instruments you should not be doing this to your skin. so i do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. but i also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. so anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it's using the tool or your fingers you do have some risk of scarring. so every pimple blackhead whitehead or a pustule or papule all starts out as a same thing. our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles which are called pores. at the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well called p. acnes. for some reason which we don't fully understand why that is the opening of the follicle can become blocked and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go it can't get to the surface. so as it builds up it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white that's a whitehead. if it opens to the surface it gets oxidized and that's a blackhead. so a blackhead isn't dark because it's dirty it's dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. if there is a p. acnes bacteria that's growing at the base of that follicle now that the follicle is closed this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. so once the covering gets closed there is no more oxygen the bacteria wakes up and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. and now its got an abundance of food supplies so it starts to flourish and that can look like a pimple. so when you pick at it what you do is you create an inflammatory response which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar and more likely to come back in the same spot so picking is very bad. but your dermatologist can help extract that for you or give you a treatment like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.	do they really work to remove blackheads and how do they work?

yes. unless there is something drastically wrong medically a woman should be able to conceive a healthy baby. many babies in fact. after a d&c and/or miscarriage. the uterus should restore itself and be receptive to pregnancy in a month or so. relatively quickly.	can you have a healthy pregnancy after having a d and c and a possible miscarriage? . i had a d and c in decmber 2013 and my husband and i have been trying & i recently took an at home pregnancy test & it should positive but i then went to the emergency room because i had heavy bleeding & they told me at the hospital that i was not pregnant. i'm confused & i have a appointment with my doctor on wednesday but would like my question answered before then to help put me at ease.
hi the hormonal and other physiological changes that are occuring to you due to the age factor are causing the problems. you seem to be having a generalised low immunity that is why you have been having so many problems recently. increasing your immunity is the only solution to this. thanks	I had major heart attack, active thyroid, Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis, bronchitis.

in most cases insurers that are doing this are offering people already insured with them the chance to sign up again for another year generally at a lower price. you can keep a non-aca compliant plan through 2014. but that option goes away in 2014 -- and it's not an option for consumers living in some states because the marketplaces have not allowed it. if you've been given the chance to buy or renew a non-aca plan for another year then i'm guessing you already know the difference in price -- likely the companies are offering a less expensive option with a plan non-compliant with the law. the plans also typically offer benefits that are not as rich. however this option for most people goes away.	i've heard aetna cigna et al. are still underwriting plans until dec. 31 2013. is this true?

there is no collagen product that when applied to the skin will penetrate and remain as intact collagen. the molecule is simply too large. however topical collagen can be a really good moisturizer. there are ingredients such as peptides and other antioxidants that can help stimulate collagen production. the effect won't be the same as having a soft tissue filler such as collagen or hyaluronic acid injected into the skin but they can help soften fine lines and wrinkles. the gold standard best product for brightening the skin is hydroquinone. other ingredients such as glutathione sepi-white n-acetyl glucosamine licorice root extract mulberry root extract and azeleic acid can also be helpful. there is no collagen pill that has been shown in proper studies to grow collagen. i do recommend a multivitamin daily omega-3 and vitamin d supplements always under the guidance of your physician.	is collagen iv an effective anti-aging product? is gluthathione iv good for skin whitening? what about a collagen pill?

what would be the point? if you have started tamiflu it is assumed that you started on day one or two. after day three this medication is not indicated. it really may not matter at this point the type of influenza you had (assuming you were properly diagnosed) unless you are getting worse or showing signs of a secondary infection. rapid flu tests are not as accurate as lab based tests so i would need to know what kind of test you were anticipating.	if you've already started tamiflu can you still be tested for h1n1?
a bunion is an irregular bony prominence (a bump) on the joint where your big toe meets the main bones of your foot. the bunion causes the end of the big toe to bend toward the other toes and crowd them while the bone at the base of the toe where it meets the foot moves outward beyond the normal limits of where the bone should be. pain is caused by inflammation and the bone pressing against the shoe. bunions are more common in women and are caused by a number of reasons including shoes that are too tight years of abnormal motion (like dancers on point) poor foot mechanics bone deformities flat feet and arthritis. treatment usually includes shoes with a roomy toe box (you should be able to wiggle your toes; the toe box should be wide enough to accommodate the bony prominence) padding over-the-counter arch supports orthotics and taping by a physical therapist or doctor. surgery is an option when conservative treatment fails and you have chronic pain. as for exercises keeping your feet strong and building up the arch might help (particularly if you have flat feet). although there isn't a lot of evidence for strengthening feet as an effective treatment for bunions it's certainly worth a try. here are some exercises to strengthen your feet. do 10-15 repetitions of each two to three sets every other day. 1. towel pull. sit in a chair barefoot with your toes on the edge of a towel. start flexing (curling) your toes and pulling the towel to draw it up under your toes. 2. big toe pulls (barefoot). wrap a thick rubber band around both big toes and pull them away from each other. you can keep heels together if you like but it's not necessary. hold each repetition for two to three seconds. 3. marble or pencil grab (barefoot). while sitting or standing try to pick up marbles or pencils with your toes. consult with your doctor or a podiatrist if you have not already done so.	are there any exercises that can ward off or help bunions?
the inability to achieve or maintain an erection could be medical or psychological or both. unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause in your case based solely on the limited information you have posted in your question. my first inclination (no pun intended) would be to feel that his is a limited psychological response perhaps due to some performance anxiety. if you can achieve an erection at other times such as a morning erection or during masturbation this would be the likely underlying cause. nearly every man at one time or another will experience temporary erectile dysfunction. alcohol use can be a factor so you may want to consider giving it up for a while until things improve. you did not mention using other recreational drugs but cannabis ecstasy and others have been implicated in temporary erectile dysfunction. if not you will need to seek the services of a skilled medical professional to look for a medical explanation.	i don't know what is wrong with me but im 20 years old and i recently stopped being able to have erections. i am in a fraternity and i drink very often. i also use tobacco. i just recently got together with a girl and i have not been able to have erections since the first time we had sex. the first time i was able to have a full erection and sustain it. it has been almost three days and i have not been able to have an erection.
migraine headaches are usually diagnosed when the symptoms are present. migraine generally begins in childhood to early adulthood. while migraines can first occur in an individual beyond the age of 50 advancing age makes other types of headaches more likely. a family history is usually present suggesting a genetic predisposition in migraine sufferers. the physical examination of individuals with migraine attacks usually is normal. patients with the first headache ever worst headache ever a significant change in the characteristics or a headache or an association of the headache with nervous system symptoms such as visual or hearing or sensory loss may require additional tests to exclude diseases other than migraine. the tests may include blood testing brain scanning (either ct or mri) or a spinal tap.	how is a migraine headache diagnosed?

assuming you have a 28 day (regular) cycle you'll start your period on day one around day 14 you ovulate - this is when the sperm can fertilize the egg give or take a day or two. if you're bleeding before your period is due it could be implantation bleeding - which is when the fertilized egg (assuming conception worked) is attaching to the wall of the uterus. if it is implantation bleeding it should be light red or brownish in color and only last a day or two at the longest. implantation bleeding occurs 6 - 12 days after conception (having sex). so going off a 28 day cycle that's day 20 - 26. two days later your period would normally come starting the cycle over with day one again.	the day of my cycle when i wipedx i noticed briht red blood. the next day it is brownish color. could i be pregnant. i have been having unprotected sex with my boyfriend regularly. i noticed that the day of my cycle there was bright red blood when i wiped. the next day the blood was a darkish brown color. im only seeing blood when i wipe.

the only way you are going to find a definitive answer as to the nature of this skin lesion. and get an effective treatment is to physically see a medical professional either your primary care medical provider or a dermatologist. it is not possible for me or any medical professional to make this important call blindly over the internet without the privilege of seeing this area first-hand and having a more detailed medical history. if this condition has been going on for years i think it is time that you see a medical professional so you can be properly diagnosed and treated.

most helpful answer keloids are very challenging to remove so you will need the services of a good dermatologist to help you. steroid injections are often used but there are other methods that the dermatologist can discuss with you. this is not something you can do at home or with any over-the-counter medications. surgically removing a keloid is iffy since the surgery alone can create a new keloid to replace the one that was removed.	i have a keloid on my chest but don't know what kind it is and want to get rid of it. i have had this keloid for 8 yrs it has never gotten bigger or smaller it is not that big its about the size of a nipple on a woman's breast a quite small one doesn't hurt or itch really ever hard dark i am african american when i was little i was scratching my chest a lot one day and the next morning a bump appeared and then the bumped turned darker and now it a keloid i guess not sure if i can use something to get rid of it or if i have to get injections surgery ect
bad smell during breathing could be due to various reasons. let us see those one by one. malignancy: an intranasal (inside the nose) or intraoral (inside the mouth) malignancy can produce foul smell that can be perceived as faeces smell by the nose. malignancy can be painless and without any symptoms. malignancies of paranasal air sinuses also produce foul odor. dental infection: a tooth decay can produce bad smell. dental infection usually produces significant pain. food particles get collected inside the decayed tooth and hence cause the bad smell. sinusitis: chronic sinusitis can cause constant post nasal drip and purulent discharge (pus discharge). this results in foul odor. maxillary sinusitis commonly produces foul odor. sinusitis will have other symptoms like headache facial pain nasal blockage post nasal drip etc. foreign body inside nose: a foreign body which has got stuck inside nose without being removed for many days will produce purulent discharge and smell. the discharge will be from one side of the nose. it is common among kids. foreign body produces nasal block. atrophic rhinitis: it is a disease where the normal space inside the nose gets increased due to destruction of the anatomy. also the condition causes merciless anosmia (loss of sensation of smell). the sufferer cannot perceive any smell but the people around him can get the extreme foul odor emanating from the patients nose. atrophic rhinitis also presents with crusting inside nose and nose block. maggots in nose: maggots are larval stage of fly (chrysomia). maggots usually occur in association with atrophic rhinitis. fly lays its eggs inside nose leading to maggots inside nose. they are attracted to the foul odor and they themselves aggravate the odor. tonsillitis: pus accumulated over the tonsil can cause bad smell. tonsillar enlargement with infection and consequent foul breath is common in many children. other symptoms of tonsillitis include fever throat pain enlarged lymph nodes of neck difficulty and pain while swallowing. nasal diphtheria can produce foul odor. diphtheria produces a membrane over the affected mucosa. rhinitis caseosa: it is a destructive disease producing foul odor. it was thought to be a fungal disease exact etiology is still not clear. tuberculosis: tb of nasal mucosa produces granulomatous inflammation and caseating necrosis consequent death of tissues and foul smell. hope i have cleared your query. further evaluation and clinical examination is required. regarding follow up:for further follow up consult an ent otolaryngologist online. ---> <link>	Hello doctor,I have bad faeces smell coming from my nose when I breathe.

to diagnose a food allergy your doctor will start with a medical history and a physical exam. your doctor will ask about any family food allergies. he or she will ask detailed questions about your symptoms and how soon they begin after you eat a suspected food. it is important to find out whether you have a food allergy or food intolerance. your doctor may ask you to keep a record of all the foods you eat and any reactions. your doctor may ask you to try an elimination diet an oral food allergy challenge or both. in an elimination diet you do not eat groups of foods that likely cause allergic reactions or specific foods based on your history and other tests. if the symptoms go away when you do not eat the food the food is suspect. if the symptoms come back when you eat the food again it may confirm that the food is causing the allergy. the diet usually lasts for 10 to 14 days. in an oral food allergy challenge you eat increasing amounts of both suspect and nonsuspect foods while being observed. your doctor watches to see if and when a reaction occurs. if you have reactions only to the suspect foods and not to the others the diagnosis can be confirmed. this test usually is the best way to determine whether a food allergy exists. you may also have allergy tests. these include: skin tests. a liquid containing an allergen is put on the top layer of skin and the skin is pricked. if the skin reacts with a raised itchy area (called a wheal) it usually means that you are allergic to that allergen. skin tests are quick simple and relatively safe. but results can be false-positive meaning that even though your skin reacts to the food you are able to eat it without symptoms. if you are extremely allergic skin testing may be dangerous. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a blood sample is taken from a vein and tested for immunoglobulin e (ige) antibodies which are produced in response to particular allergens. food allergy tests that are not helpful or are unproved include: 4 igg4 antibody. provocation/neutralization. cytotoxicity. applied kinesiology. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for food allergies?
it is possible that insurers will cover medications for off-label use. medicare for example has expanded its coverage of off-label drug use of cancer drugs. generally you would need to provide a compelling medical reason for the need backed by some scientific evidence of the drug's effectiveness and a lack of other treatment options. always check with your insurer about its rules for gaining approval for medications. and in such cases you would definitely need the participation of your doctor who will need to write a letter explaining your condition and why the medication in question is required. as far as finding information about medications being used for ailments other than those for which they've obtained fda approval you might try clinicaltrials. gov a clearinghouse of clinical trials maintained by the national institutes of health. you can also search medical journal articles that support the treatment’s use by searching pubmed a service of the u. s. national library of medicine at www. pubmed. gov.	is it possible for an insurance company to cover a medication to treat something other than the initial use? . how can one find out if medications are being tried for ailments other than the conditions approved by the fda?

pcips which went into effect last july were set up to extend coverage for the medically uninsurable. the plans -- which cover primary and specialty care hospitalization prescription drugs and preventive care at 100% -- are intended to function as a bridge until 2014 when insurers can no longer deny coverage even to those who are sick. here is what's different about these plans: looser requirements: the requirement that you must demonstrate that you've been denied by insurers before applying has been lifted. that's a big deal and saves both time and money for people interested in applying. lower cost: the federal government runs the pcip program in 23 states and washington d. c. in most of those places the plans will become more affordable. the amount of premium cuts will vary by state with some slashing prices by as much as 40%. you can check the government's web site to see what prices are where you live. state flexibility: there are 27 states that run their own pcip program which have been granted the option by the federal government to reduce premium costs as well. check with your state's health department or pcip (visit pcip. gov or call 866-717-5826). unfortunately what's not different is the requirement that you are uninsured for six months in order to qualify for coverage. for information about how to sign up for a pcip plan visit pcip. gov or call 866-717-5826.	what are pre-existing condition insurance plans (pcip)?

"cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in the body. these extra cells grow together and form masses called tumors. in colorectal cancer these growths usually start as polyps in the large intestine ( colon or rectum). colon polyps are quite common and most do not cause problems. but if they are not detected and removed some of them can turn into cancer. cancers in the colon or rectum usually grow very slowly. it takes most of them years to become large enough to cause symptoms. if the cancer is allowed to grow it eventually will invade and destroy nearby tissues and then spread farther. colorectal cancer spreads first to nearby lymph nodes. from there it may spread to other parts of the body usually the liver. it may also spread to the lungs and less often to the bones and the brain. the long-term outcome or prognosis for colorectal cancer depends on how much the cancer has grown and spread. experts talk about prognosis in terms of ""5-year survival rates. "" the 5-year survival rate means the percentage of people who are still alive 5 years or longer after their cancer was discovered. it is important to remember that these are only averages. everyone's case is different and these numbers do not necessarily show what will happen to you. the estimated 5-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is: 1 90% or more if cancer is found early and treated before it has spread. 67% if the cancer has spread to nearby organs and lymph nodes. 10% if the cancer has spread to the liver lungs or bones. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."	what happens to someone when they get colorectal cancer?

the carotid arteries are a pair of arteries that serve as the main pipelines bringing oxygen-rich blood to the brain. the carotid arteries travel through the neck next to the windpipe. stenosis means an abnormal narrowing of a body part -- in this case an artery. distal means the far end of a body part. (the closer end is referred to as proximal. ) so this condition could more plainly be described as moderate narrowing of the far end of the right main artery in the neck. carotid artery stenosis often is caused by atherosclerosis a slow process of hardening and narrowing of the arteries throughout life. cholesterol-rich plaques develop in the walls of arteries in the neck heart and elsewhere and slowly grow. if cholesterol plaques grow and protrude into the center of the artery they can interfere with blood flow. this usually occurs very gradually and the body adapts so there are often no symptoms. the biggest risk is from the sudden rupture of a cholesterol plaque. this can result in rapid formation of a blood clot causing a heart attack or stroke. moderate carotid artery stenosis means the artery is narrowed but blood flow is not severely reduced. treatment depends on whether symptoms are present. for people who have had a stroke or mini-stroke (transient ischemic attack or tia) surgery to open the blockage (endarterectomy) is often recommended. however even without symptoms carotid artery stenosis is a yellow caution flag signaling you’re at risk for heart attack and stroke. a healthy diet regular exercise not smoking and taking the right medications can reduce your risk significantly. can diet change carotid artery disease if so what diet changes are recommended	what is moderate right distal carotid artery stenosis?
so if you are not having problems sleeping on your back. it is fine and does not put any risk to the fetus. . your body will tell you when you cannot be on your back anymore. the reason many physicians tell you not to sleep on your back is due to the uterus' pressure on the inferior vena cava (a large blood vessel that takes blood back to the heart from the lower body). this decreases the blood flow back to the heart which causes all of the changes for patients. it causes a decrease in the blood flow to the heart and causes the mother to sweat increase in heart rate and nervous. the mother will need to get off of [her] back to feel better.	is it dangerous to sleep on your back when you are pregnant?
most helpful answer you may have a few days of mouth discomfort but your dentist will provide you with some pain medication. you may need to alter your diet a bit (assuming you are hungry) but as far as complications are concerned this would be unlikely. assuming you are healthy. one thing of concern especially the lower extraction sites would be acquiring a dry socket. this is when the blood clot (part of the healing process) can become dislodged. can be caused by sucking liquids through a straw smoking. can be very painful but can be remedied by going back to dentist or oral surgeon and having what is called gel-foam usually coated with a substance called eugenol placed in socket. this usually takes care of pain and promotes healing.	getting all four wisdom teeth removed all at once over spring break. should i be worried of complications?

researchers have yet to pinpoint the exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) but brain abnormalities genetic (family) influences and environmental factors are being studied. brain scans of people with ocd have shown that they have different patterns of brain activity than people without ocd and that abnormal functioning of circuitry within a certain part of the brain (striatum) may cause the disorder. abnormalities in other parts of the brain and an imbalance of brain chemicals especially serotonin may also contribute to ocd. 1 some experts believe that a problem related to infections such as strep throat or scarlet fever can suddenly bring on the disorder or make its symptoms worse in some children. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes obsessive-compulsive disorder ocd?

the appearance of vaginal mucous is not a definitive sign of ovulation. assuming you are on an oral contraceptive (you did not specify) and taking it properly it is unlikely that you ovulated. yes people can get pregnant even on birth control pills since the effectiveness is not 100% so it may be wise to use a secondary method as well (like condoms). statistically you are probably just fine with your contraception so relax.	did i just ovulate on birth control!? please read! . i just went to the bathroom and when i wiped i had a mucusy clear/yellowish substance with a small brown tinted dot in the middle. i am on birth control and i just had sex yesterday (wednesday). i finished my period tuesday. am i ovulating? i'm very concerned because i did not have sex with a condom. please help!

sorry to hear about this rash. how annoying! rashes are difficult to diagnose without a physical examination. it's certainly possible that too much sun exposure caused your rash but it seems odd it would only be on one side of the face. if your rash becomes painful and turns to blisters and if you've ever had chickenpox then you should be alert to the possibility this could be shingles. shingles is a bit unusual in someone your age but it's not unheard of. shingles can be contagious so if you develop the above symptoms i'd advise calling your primary care provider and letting him or her know about your rash so he or she can determine if you should come into the office. also if you develop those symptoms stay away from anyone who has not had chickenpox in order to avoid giving them the virus. chances are your rash is not serious and will clear up on its own. if it gets worse or doesn't clear up within a few days i'd suggest you visit your health care provider. good luck to you!	hi i woke up with a red bumps on my left cheek. it doesnt look like acne. i was in the sun yesterday are they sunspots? . i am fifteen years old. i get pimples/acne every now and then. but this doesnt look like acne. theyre red bumbs all over my cheek. they aren't itchy but my face feels warm when i touch it. i dont have any allergies that i am aware of and i dont think i ate something that might have caused this. i was in the sun yesterday. do you think that's what caused it. please help me. . thank you. -sarah
this is a difficult question to answer as it will all depend on how things go. your friend may need to change some things initially during the recovery period. however there is a very good chance that she will have no long lasting effects from the surgery (though this somewhat depends on what part of the colon is going to be removed). i would recommend that your friend talk to her surgeon to be sure she knows what to look out for.	my friend is facing removal of about two feet of her colon and i was wondering what she can expect afterward?

this is due to your circulation (or lack of). during cold weather the body will set priorities making sure that warm rich blood makes it to your brain and vital organs. the fingers toes and nose are often sacrificed to make sure those other organs remain warm and functioning. people who smoke tend to have peripheral circulation issues so they tend to get cold fingers more often. raynaud's syndrome is another possibility for cold white digits. cold weather or not.	why do my fingers turn white & get numb in cold weather?
the affordable care act does require that all insurance plans in the marketplaces cover 10 essential benefits. that includes behavioral health treatment and rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices. so yes some degrees of autism treatment will likely be covered in every state. however it's unclear at this point which specific treatments will be covered. the level of autism coverage will depend on your state. about half of the states in the country for example will cover autism treatments like applied behavioral analysis which many experts think is one of the most effective treatments. here is more information on how autism coverage varies from state to state.	my son has autism. how will the affordable care act help my family?
pain associated with migraines is a very individualized symptom. it isn't a symptom that a health care professional can visually see to measure the intensity. we rely on the patient to give specifics on the tolerability and type of pain so we can better identify the type of medication that will work specifically for your type of pain and the location of the pain. without knowing more about your pain i would not be able to tell you which medication is better. i can inform you a bit more about the details of each medication. one common ingredient in all three of these products is acetaminophen which functions to increase the effects of the primary pain reliever. in addition to acetaminophen darvocet contains propoxephene. tylenol no. 3 contains codeine. lortab contains hydrocodone. these medications are the primary pain relievers. they also cause drowsiness. while analgesics (acetaminophen) nsaids and narcotics relieve pain they don't address the underlying physiology of the migraine which is primarily the dilation of blood vessels in the brain causing pressure on nerves in such a tight closure of an area. two classes of migraine drugs that can aid with the dilation of blood vessels in the brain are ergotamines and triptans.	what will work better for migraine relief: darvocet-n 100 tylenol with codeine no. 3 or lortab?
pain in this area especially in a person who has been coughing for a week could indicate a few different things but unfortunately the exact cause could not be determined based solely on symptoms. he would need to be examined and perhaps have another chest x-ray (findings can change). basilar pneumonia (pneumonia the lower parts of the lungs can cause chest pain). someone who is coughing can have muscle strain of the intercostal (between the rib) muscles. finally people who cough often swallow a great deal of air. when this air is trapped in the large intestines it can migrate upward under the ribs and cause pain due to pressure against the diaphragm. there can be other causes of course. you are right to be concerned so please see his medical provider again.	why is my son having chest pain and his lower left and right sides hurt? . my son has been coughing for a while over 2 weeks he then started wheezing. he was giving an inhaler to use and some chest xrays were done for pneumonia and that came back negative. they did notice some cloudiness on the right side of his chest. he has been complaining of chest pains. he is now saying that his lower left and right sides hurt right above his waist closer to his back. i am concerned. his pulse was a 57-60 last week i took him to the er and they gave him 2 breathing treatments.

researchers have long known that older people are more likely to get phn (postherpetic neuralgia) the nerve pain after shingles but recent studies have found other factors that increase risks. in one study published in the journal neurology researchers -- including robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y -- looked at data from 965 people with shingles. the researchers identified five risk factors for developing phn in people who had been recently diagnosed with shingles: older female presence of symptoms before the rash appeared like numbness tingling itching or pain severe pain during the illness' initial stages severe rash. importantly the researchers found the more risk factors you have the greater the risk of developing phn. for instance 17% of women with shingles went on to get phn. 26% of people with severe pain did too. but 50% of women who were over 60 and had symptoms before the rash severe rash and acute pain went on to get phn.	what are the risk factors for having nerve pain after shingles?

most helpful answer the important thing is that you understand why the dessert is in your meal plan. talking with your therapist is key because he or she is likely doing it to help change your relationship with food. the tendency with eating disorders/disordered eating is people give too much power to a single food instead of looking at the overall pattern of eating. as for your health no eating a sweet food everyday will not ruin your health (i do it! ) especially when your diet is balanced. it's the extremes that are harmful -- eating sweets/chips/empty calorie foods all day long or eliminating so many foods/items that it's hard to maintain a healthy weight and enjoy eating. i hope that helps. good luck on your journey!	what health consequences will i face because of my meal plan for my eating disorder and the desserts that i eat nightly? . i am currently recovering from an eating disorder and have to follow a meal plan. sadly this requires me to eat dessert every night. i have been doing so since about mid-february. i am a fitness and nutrition fanatic (this did not help in developing an) and i have a major fear of suffering health consequences due to the fact that i am forced to eat sugary desserts every night. is there any health repercussions? what should i do?

sometimes the scale doesn’t accurately reflect what’s really happening with your body. keep in mind that your weight can fluctuate naturally throughout the course of a day. consider if you’ve eaten used the restroom or how well hydrated you are; all of which have a physical weight to them that can influence the number on the scale. seeing a change like loss of inches can be a great indicator of progress. see if you notice a more “toned” appearance or more muscle definition as well. also check to see if your clothes fit differently such as by dropping pants sizes having to take a belt in more notches or shirts being loose or not as tight. these changes in body composition can be viewed as more favorable than actual weight loss recorded on a scale. i wholly encourage you to not just view your progress through solely what the scale shows alone. if you do weigh yourself however it may be best to limit yourself to once per week just so that you can notice any weight loss trends but not enough to where you’re obsessing over the numbers. keep the timing of when you weigh yourself the same to establish consistency probably first thing in the morning to help take away confounding variables.	what can be causing me to not see the numbers on the scale to drop but the inches are dropping? . i have incorporated a healthy diet with regular exercise i can see the changes but nothing on the scale changes. stumped

there is a multi-state plan that is currently offered in 30 states and missouri and virginia are two of those states. blue cross blue shield is the insurance company offering the multi-state plan. the multi-state plan is really about increasing the number of plans offered nationally not necessarily addressing your issue of living in two different states. blue cross blue shield may allow you to see providers in other states but you would have to look at the specifics of that plan. you can find the multi-state plan through the healthcare. gov website.	i was told there would be a multi-state health insurance plan offered but haven't been able to find info on it.
you could ask your doctor for an antiviral but your risk is fairly low. you wouldn't be getting genital herpes anyway - you'd be getting hsv1 that causes cold sores and that's much milder than hsv2 the virus that causes genital herpes. true you can get hsv2 on the mouth and hsv1 on the genitals but in general hsv1 is much milder and less problematic. you probably already have it on your mouth anyway about 80% of the human population have the virus. most of the time it causes no problems.	after giving me a blowjob my gf found a cold sore. is there a drug to reduce the chance that i'll get genital herpes? . after giving me a blowjob my girlfriend found a cold sore. the sore was very early stage and barely visible. 12 hours later it is still barely visible. . is there a drug i can take to prevent or reduce the chance or contracting genital herpes? . please help.
when looking for a therapist it is important to find one that is qualified affordable and that you can connect well with. when you first talk with a therapist (either on the phone or in person) consider it an interview to see if the person is right for you. ask about their credentials making sure that they are a licensed psychiatrist psychologist social worker or counselor. offer a thumbnail sketch of your issue and ask if this is the kind of issue that they treat and have expertise with. ask what their approach is and why they think it would be helpful for you. as you listen to these answers think about whether you feel comfortable not only with what they are saying but also with how they are saying it. in terms of finding someone you can afford you might want to try a local clinic hospital or teaching institution (a school that trains therapists might have its own clinic) because they might have a sliding scale. although those in training are less experienced (a downside) and might make you think twice about going they also receive supervision-- and sometimes the training is for experienced people working on a more advanced degree. again if you feel comfortable that is most important (along with proper qualifications). you might want to check with the self-help support group clearinghouse for both self-help groups and recommendations for where to seek sliding scale professional help. try the state or local professional associations (i. e. for psychologists or social workers) and ask if they can direct you. and whoever you call for help if they cannot help ask if they can direct you as to where to get help.	how can i find a reasonably priced qualified mental health counselor?
tuberculosis commonly known as tb is a bacterial infection that can spread through the lymph nodes and bloodstream to any organ in your body -- and most often is found in the lungs. most people who are exposed to tb never develop symptoms since the bacteria can live in an inactive form in the body. but if the immune system weakens such as in people with hiv or elderly adults tb bacteria can become active. in their active state tb bacteria cause death of tissue in the organs they infect. active tb disease can be fatal if left untreated.	what is tuberculosis?
i will never understand that rationale of giving antibiotics to anyone that has a viral infection. this is not good medicine. most cases of tonillitis are viral and antibiotics are absolutely worthless and sometimes even harmful. with that said. first i assume you are a healthy adult. most adults have relatively good immune systems that fight off viral (and bacterial) exposures 24/7. while the organisms may be capable of causing disease the organism has to find a susceptible host. most of the time we just fight off those alien bugs. if you don't have tonsils you can't get tonsillitis but you can get a viral infection but it does not mean it will be identical to your son who has a different immune system. you may just get a stuffy nose or nothing at all. in your case you did get an upper respiratory infection but it didn't have to come from your son. it could have been someone else and an entired different bug. there are over 200 respiratory viruses capable of causing colds. i get exposed to strep a dozen times a week and have never got it thanks to my own immune system (and perhaps better handwashing and other precautions). trust your immune system. in most cases you will be just fine. the cold that you most likely have now will likely improve in a few days on its own.	can a person get tonsilitis if they nolonger have tonsils. my son had tonsilitis. tonsilitis is a viral infection and does not require an antibiotic. however tonsilitis can be caused by strep which is bacterial which requires an antibiotic. dr did't do a strep test but perscribed an antibiotic. a few days after he got better i developed an extremely sore throat runny nose caughing headache no fever. tonsilitis symptoms. can i get tonsilitis if i had my tonsils removed? if i have a strep infection will my immune system fight it off.

it is difficult to interpret the possible cause of the lesion detected in the mri without more medical history as well and complete mri visualization. possible causes that can present as lumps around the clavicle include - enlarged lymph nodes with or without abscess formation tumors like osteochondroma or it could also be a bony lump caused by a healing fracture of the clavicle. it would be best if you can consult the doctors treating you who can go through the mri and advice you accordingly. i hope this helps.	hi. my mum has had a lump just below her clavical/collarbone. she had an x-ray and the guy said he didn't know what it was but he didn't think it was cancerous just to come back for a check up in 6 months. fast forward a couple months my mom went to her gp and she ordered an mri. the results just came back and it said she has a hypo intense t1 and hyperintense stir involving the first anterior rib. a subtle abnormal enhancement of the rib was also identified. everything else in the area looked normal. they said she needs to go back for a ct scan. she just had a benign brain tumor removed and now she has to go through this it's very difficult. is this something that sounds like we should be concerned about? what could this possibly potentially be? thank you.

"a diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be suspected in patients with fatigue cold intolerance constipation and dry flaky skin. a blood test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. when hypothyroidism is present the blood levels of thyroid hormones can be measured directly and are usually decreased. however in early hypothyroidism the level of thyroid hormones (t3 and t4) may be normal. therefore the main tool for the detection of hyperthyroidism is the measurement of tsh the thyroid stimulating hormone. tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland. if a decrease of thyroid hormone occurs the pituitary gland reacts by producing more tsh and the blood tsh level increases in an attempt to encourage thyroid hormone production. this increase in tsh can actually precede the fall in thyroid hormones by months or years. thus the measurement of tsh should be elevated in cases of hypothyroidism. however there is one exception. if the decrease in thyroid hormone is actually due to a defect of the pituitary or hypothalamus then the levels of tsh are abnormally low. this kind of thyroid disease is known as ""secondary"" or ""tertiary"" hypothyroidism. a special test known as the trh test can help distinguish whether the disease is caused by a defect in the pituitary or the hypothalamus. this test requires an injection of the trh hormone and is performed by an endocrinologist (hormone specialist)."	how is hypothyroidism diagnosed?
your husband needs to see a medical provider so these lumps possibly reactive lymph nodes or? can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. it would not be possible to determine the true nature of them blindly over the internet based solely on the brief information in your posting. men are stubborn and i suspect your husband is no different. make the appointment for him and take him; even if he is kicking and complaining the entire way. this is really the only way to get these lumps properly assessed.	hi my husband has a lump on his head that has been there for 2 weeks and now has a lump under his armpit. hi my husband has a lump on the back of his head for about 2 weeks now and it appeared there without injury we were a little concerned but now i am really concerned because he has another lump under his armpit that has been there for 2days
i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group 60-100 (just celebrated a 101sst birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease.	is it normal for a patient to have anxiety when having an uncurable severe illness?
unfortunately my answer is: many things could cause this. floaters in the eye aren't uncommon. these tiny flecks of tissue can well float through your vision from time to time. the condition is usually harmless but in some cases can point to more serious underlying eye problems. so if this visual disturbance is a new symptom you should visit an ophthalmologist soon to get it checked out. migraine headaches also can include a component of visual disturbance called an 'aura. ' if you're experiencing the visual distortion you describe with a headache you'd be well-advised to see a medical professional for treatment. occasionally the type of symptoms you're describing can be an indicator of something serious like retinal detachment. if the symptoms are severe or you notice them getting rapidly worse please go to an emergency room. these conditions need to be treated promptly. otherwise you might start with your primary care provider or an eye doctor to see if you can get to the bottom of what's going on. good luck!	what causes moving visual distortions?

there is no data on this as yet. how long you fast (once a month three times a week) is an issue. as well what kind of fast are we talking about? scientists have been studying severe caloric restriction for years in animals. you might say they are kept in a state of semi-starvation. indeed these animals do have a lower incidence of some medical conditions but at what price? no one can ask the animals if they’re enjoying any of this. on the other hand keeping total calories under control with a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity is a reasonable way to rein in calories and achieve an optimal life span.	can fasting help prolong your lifespan?

"as you know i cannot ""see"" your throat and examine you over the internet and unfortunately your description is really not specific enough for me to even guess. a medical provider must see these things first-hand. a mono test taken early in the course of an illness may not be very accurate so your medical provider should consider doing an ebv titer (a very sensitive mono test) if the clinical findings warrant it. a z-pack is not the treatment of choic for strep so perhaps a repeat strep culture is indicated as well (not the rapid strep test) and while you are at it a cbc (complete blood count) would be helpful information. the vast majority of sore throats are viral but sometimes this virus is mono so this diagnosis needs to be revisited."	23 yr old non smoker w/ swollen enlarged tonsil hard to swallow but tests showed it isn't strep or mono so what is it? . i went to see a doctor today but his diagnosis (acute pharyngitis) does not feel right. about 3 wks ago i was diagnosed with strep throat. my lymph nodes were very swollen and tender to the touch. i had a fever throat was sore and there were white spots on my tonsils. no swab test. i was on antibiotics for 5 days (z-pak and prednisone) which helped. my sore throat came back over a week ago. i then noticed a little red bump on my left tonsil that got bigger and now my sore throat is worse! help!

hi this is from the uk's nhs. you can catch chlamydia through unprotected vaginal anal or oral sex. it can also be passed on if you share sex toys and don’t wash them or cover them with a condom each time they’re used. it’s unclear whether chlamydia can be spread if infected semen or vaginal fluid on your fingers is transferred to another person’s genitals or by rubbing female genitals together. you can’t catch chlamydia from kissing or sharing facilities such as toilets or towels with someone who has the infection. so as for 3 month old very dry clothing if there was some on them they would not be alive now. but if you do have a re-occurrence then that's all part of the chlamydia game it just loves to come back again and again sometimes the length could be up to 15 years or longer. hope this helps you. good luck	can you re-catch chlamydia from unwashed clothing? . specifically i am at university and before summer term ended i caught chlamydia (i only found this out mid-summer) and i left some clothing behind such as unwashed pyjama bottoms. i've returned after having been treated and testing clean and without thinking i wore the bottoms. i feel like i've had persistent symptoms which i can't seem to shake and don't seem to be thrush could i have caught chlamydia back from the clothing/towels even if it's been over 3 months since they were worn?
when it comes to constipation fiber hydration and moving are important. there are other sources of fiber you can include such as whole grains bran cereals beans and legumes a variety of fruit (especially prunes or fruit with skins like apples) and flaxmeal. adequate fat can also help and it sounds like you are getting very little as can sources of probiotics (yogurt/kefir in smoothies etc). for healthy fat sources try sliced avocado more olive oil and nuts and seeds (which also contain fiber). even though extra water can help just be careful about getting too much. while what you eat and exercise matter there are other causes of constipation like stress. see this article for more information. and if this don't improve with diet changes see your doctor. good luck! you have to add more fiber to your diet. you can try trusculpt if you want to reduce the appearance of fats in a faster way. check out www. bodytreatmentcenter. com.	i've been eating salads(no cheese) okra and asparagus and drinking about 80-100oz of water/day and constipated. i'm not sure what else to do. i eat vegetables(brocoli spinach asparagus okra pickles cucumbers tomatoes) and egg whites with a drop of olive oil and i drink tons of water. i mean i drink a lot of water. i weigh 130 and drink between 80-100oz a day. i exercise regularly and don't drink. i go for 5-9days without pooping and then i will have a painful hard poop the size of a newborn baby. any advice? . i'm also very bloated and pee all of the time.

there has been ongoing controversy surrounding certain childhood vaccines and their relationship to autism. many studies have looked at whether there is a link between autism and vaccines. to date there is no convincing evidence that any vaccine can cause autism. a suspected link between the measles mumps rubella (mmr) vaccine and autism has been suggested by some parents of children with autism. typically symptoms of autism are first noted by parents as their child begins to have difficulty with delays in speaking after age 1. around this same time the mmr vaccine is first given to children. therefore autism cases with an apparent onset within a few weeks after the mmr vaccination may simply be an unrelated chance occurrence. parents have also questioned whether mercury-containing thimerosal (used as a preservative in vaccines) might cause autism. today with the exception of some influenza vaccines vaccines used in the united states to protect preschool-aged children contain reduced or no thimerosal as a preservative. (influenza vaccine is currently available both with thimerosal as a preservative and preservative-free. ) according to the cdc there is no convincing scientific evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. more importantly studies have not found a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. because the exact cause of autism is not known parents may continue to have concerns despite the evidence. in these cases parents should be aware of the risks of serious disease in children who are not vaccinated. in some areas outbreaks of these dangerous diseases have occurred in people who have not been immunized. understanding the ruling on autism-like symptoms and vaccines in a recent controversy a georgia girl was entitled to compensation after developing autism-like symptoms after receiving five childhood vaccines in 2000. but what does this decision mean to your child and to other children? it's important to note that the government has not said that childhood vaccines actually cause autism. rather the division of vaccine injury compensation (dvic) at the department of health and human services agreed there is a possibility that the vaccines aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder in this young girl. the mitochondrial disorder manifested as a regressive neurological disease with some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. understandably many parents are worried about the risks that are feared to accompany vaccinations. ever since the first vaccines were developed there have been risks. most vaccine side effects are mild and severe ones are extremely rare. but the use of vaccines in children has essentially eradicated a number of major childhood diseases that kill. when parents fail to vaccinate their children the risk of serious -- even deadly -- disease epidemics extends beyond them and their families to their neighborhoods and communities. failure to vaccinate lays the foundation for new epidemics that could result in serious harm to your child. for instance a decline in vaccination rates in some european countries has led to fatal outbreaks of measles. in short whereas advocacy groups against childhood vaccines continue to take issue with immunizations cdc officials maintain that this recent ruling should not be generalized to the risk of vaccines for all children. in a statement the american academy of pediatrics reinforced its dedication to the health of all children and urges parents to fully immunize their children.	can childhood vaccines cause autism?

the immune system which defends the body against disease is made up of millions of cells that circulate through the body or reside in lymph nodes. like all cells in the body they require a wide spectrum of nutrients to perform at their peak. over the years research has pointed to key roles for nearly all nutrients including zinc iron copper selenium and vitamins a c e d and b6. doctors have long known that serious malnutrition can weaken the immune system making people vulnerable to many kinds of infections. to support your immune system focus on eating a healthy diet with plenty of fruits vegetables whole grains and unsaturated oils. you can also consider a multivitamin to help fill any nutritional gaps in your diet.	are certain vitamins and minerals especially important for a healthy immune system?

it’s the kind of headline that generates attention: “insomnia triggers men’s death kids’ mental decline. ” that’s what the latest research published in the journal sleep is showing. in one study researchers at penn state college of medicine found: * men with chronic insomnia who got less than six hours of sleep a night were four times more likely to die than those who regularly got more rest. in this 14-year study weight and smoking habits were factored into the difference. in another study this one done in australia a group of researchers looked at the link between sleep and mental illnesses among young people and discovered that: * young adults who habitually slept fewer than five hours a night were three times more likely to develop psychiatric disorders than those that got eight to nine hours of shut-eye. that’s pretty alarming. the australian researchers surveyed about 20 000 people between the ages of 17 years and 24 years over 18 months. i’ve written many times about the importance of sleep for our youth and this further confirms my recommendation. teens need at least eight-and-a-half hours of sleep a night to function best but many aren’t getting that. if you’ve got young adults in your home you’re well aware of the challenges to changing household habits around sleep. it’s long been known that the effects of sleep deprivation are deadly. sleep deprivation raises your risk for a slew of health problems including heart disease diabetes and high blood pressure. that’s the reasoning behind the increased risk of death among men who don’t get enough sleep. you have to wonder though: did their poor sleep habits begin in adolescence? they may not have grown into adults with “psychiatric disorders ” but habits typically start in one’s youth. changing the sleep habits of a young person takes a concerted effort starting with a simple conversation about the value and importance of sleep. this may not go over too well with teenagers who prefer to stay up late but as with everyone else their morning wake-up call doesn’t usually change. so to get more sleep you have to be an enforcer: * change the bedtime routine and get to bed sooner. * set limits on things like electronics television viewing and engaging in stimulating activities. * maintain sound sleep environments. this goes for children their dads and their moms. women don’t get a free pass here. they’ll be the target of another study soon enough. and the headline will read something like “sleep: live longer stay sharper be happier. ”	why is getting enough sleep so important?
most helpful answer hi depending on what time of your cycle you had sex would determine if you get pregnant his high sperm count would not matter. but timing dose if you had unprotected sex on say day 12 of your cycle (it works this way day one is the day you start your period) around day 14 is your egg release day male sperm takes 3 days to reach your womb and can live a lot longer than your egg will so hopefully they meet at the right time so can you see how its all down to timing and not so much high sperm count. hope this helps you. good luck	(urgent) what are the chances of being pregnant? and when did conception occour or when will it if it hasn't already? . me and my man had unprotected sex august 3th today is august 8th. . what are the chances of me being pregnant if my periods are irregular? he also has high sperm count. and when will i experience symptoms of pregnancy? and when will conception occur? thank you!

i have a better idea: stay home. there are a handful of causes of ear pain. an “ear infection” is infected fluid behind the eardrum in a space called the “middle ear. ” the medical term for this is “otitis media ” sometimes called “acute otitis media” to stress that it begins suddenly. acute otitis media almost always occurs after a child has had nasal congestion for a few days most typically from a cold. if your child complains of ear pain and hasn’t been congested it probably isn’t an ear infection. even if your child really does have an ear infection you don’t necessarily have to rush to have it checked. an antibiotic isn’t thefirst thing he needs. in fact it may not be necessary at all! so what should parents do about a weekend or middle-of-the-night earache? if the child looks miserable and sick he really should be seen right away. if the pain is more mild or moderate give him a dose of pain medicine like ibuprofen or have him hold a warm heating pad against the ear. if the pain subsides with these simple measures an emergency trip to the doctor or er is not necessary. what happens if you delay starting antibiotics for an ear infection? as long as the child isn’t super-miserable it’s ok to wait a bit. ear infections it turns out usually go away on their own. waiting a day or two if your child is reasonably comfortable is a good way to avoid extra costs hassle and antibiotics. note that this advice is meant for children older than two who can speak and describe what they’re feeling. if your child is younger you should call your doctor for more specific advice on whether you ought to wait a few days before being seen on the weekend.	it’s sunday and my 3 year old son has an earache. should i take him to the er or an urgent care clinic?

the poison ivy rash usually starts one or two days after exposure though the delay between contact and its onset can be longer up to several days. this may lead to confusion over where the exposure took place. the first signs of the rash are curved lines of red itchy bumps or blisters. these continue to appear for many days depending on how much resin touched the skin at a given point. this makes it seem as though the rash is spreading although the fluid in blisters is just part of the allergic reaction and contains no chemicals or bacteria. it also makes it appear that there may still be poison ivy in clothes and/or on pets. although this is theoretically possible repeated washing of these often produces no improvement. poison ivy is not contagious neither from one person to someone else nor from one part of the body to another. many references emphasize that animals can carry the poison ivy resin. there's no doubt this is true but its practical significance may be limited. the first sign of poison ivy after all is usually a curved line of rash on the skin. unless your dog is shaped like a curved line your poison ivy is more likely to have come from a stem or leaf which dragged against the skin not from your pet.	what are the signs and symptoms of the poison ivy rash?
doctors familiar with the treatment of migraine headaches should prescribe preventive medications. decisions about which preventive medication to use are based on the side effects of the medication and the medical conditions that the patient may have. propranolol (inderal) often is used first provided that the patient does not have asthma copd or heart disease. amitriptyline (elavil endep) also is used commonly. preventive medications are begun at low doses and gradually increased to higher doses if needed. this minimizes side effects from the medications. preventive medications are to be taken daily for months to years. when they are stopped the dose needs to be gradually reduced rather than abruptly stopped. abruptly stopping preventive medications can lead to headaches. in some instances more than one drug may be needed. nonmedication and behavioral therapies also may be needed.	what is the proper way to use preventive medications for migraines?

most cases of atopic dermatitis can be diagnosed from a medical history and a physical exam. you will be asked about your family history of allergic conditions when the itch first started and when the rash first appeared. what the rash look likes and where it is located will help your doctor make a diagnosis. your or your child's condition is more likely to be atopic dermatitis if a parent or brother or sister has an allergic condition (especially asthma allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis ). allergy testing your doctor may recommend allergy testing to identify any factors that are related to atopic dermatitis flares. allergy testing is most helpful for people with atopic dermatitis who also have respiratory allergies or asthma. allergy testing can help identify certain allergens. but test results are often false-positive. for more information see the topic allergy tests. if a specific allergen is thought to trigger your atopic dermatitis you and your doctor will discuss how to eliminate it from your diet or environment while closely observing and recording your symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for atopic dermatitis?
"it's difficult to answer your question due to some key information that's lacking. for example ""laser resurfacing"" can be done any almost any body part. usually after laser resurfacing of the face we advise patients to keep the skin slathered with moisturizer at all times. that's because the laser can cause severe drying of the skin. however for some people all that goop on the face can indeed cause a breakout of pimples. i suggest you consult your provider to find out if what you're experiencing is normal and if so how to treat it. laser resurfacing of the face also can cause a flare-up of cold sores. if this is the type of ""breakout"" you're referring to then you again should consult your provider to see if you can take a prescription medication to treat the cold sores. whenever a person undergoes a procedure like laser resurfacing they should receive clear written instructions that detail post-procedure care. if you don't receive written instructions you definitely need to ask a lot of questions and take notes about how to care for your skin after laser resurfacing what the normal healing process entails and so on. hope this helps!"	is it normal to break out after a laser resurfacing procedure and what should i do

yes you can but very few people do. mononucleosis is usually caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv). symptoms usually include fever swollen and painful tonsils and enlarged lymph nodes. fatigue and low energy can last for weeks or months. more than 90% of us eventually catch ebv usually during adolescence or early adulthood. in many people the illness is mild and may never be diagnosed as mono. infection by ebv generally results in lifelong immunity—you can only have ebv mono once. there’s also a less common form of mononucleosis caused by infection by cytomegalovirus (cmv). in one study of people with mono about one out of seven had mono caused by cmv; the rest had typical ebv mononucleosis. catching and recovering from ebv mono offers no protection against cmv mono and vice versa. few people get mono from cmv. most people are infected with cmv at some point in life and experience only mild short-lived symptoms. after that they are generally immune to cmv mono or other illnesses caused by cmv. i have had mono three times. all three times were medically confirmed by a doctor upon analysis of a blood test. i was shocked because i was under the impression you could not get it more than once. i told the doctor that i had already had it once so if possibly that's what was showing up in my blood test. she said they test for the active form and i 100% had it. either i am a medical mystery or you can definitely get mono more than once even more than twice! my daughter is 31 yrs old and has had mono confirmed 4 times. the first time she was 15 and was just confirmed today for the 4th time. we were told that it stays in your system forever and when you get stressed don't get enough sleep or if her immune system is low it will come back. it is hard to get some people to understand that she can't run all the time like most 31 yr olds. the doctor told her she is to just to go to work and rest as much as possible. i tested positive for mono 8 or 9 years ago. i am 49 years old and my blood test just came back. the dr. told me that i tested extremely positive for mono. both times my only symptom has been extreme fatigue. thought this stuff was for the youngsters! i have had mono twice i am 18 and i am now just getting over the second time. the first time i got mono i had chicken pox and mono and the second time i had mono strep and a absence in my right tonsil which makes your tonsil full of puss and blood and it constantly has to be drained. both times i was in the hospital for up to five days. so i am living proof that you can get mono and other infections at the same time.	can you get mono twice?
one of the first steps in quitting smoking is to examine the different methods to become smoke free and decide which one would work best for you. some of the options include nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) such as gum or patches; prescription medication like chantix or wellbutrin; or methods like tapering postponing or cold turkey. do research beforehand to weigh the pros and cons of each method before implementing a program. next think about how ready you are to quit smoking on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being not ready to quit whatsoever and 10 being ready to quit right now. pick a number that best represents where you stand at the moment. why didn’t you pick a number that was lower? here it may help to think about the benefits that you stand to gain from quitting smoking or your reasons behind wanting to quit. what would it take for you to be higher on that scale towards a 10 then? at this point it might help to think about what you would need to become fully motivated and put your thoughts about quitting smoking into action. it’s important to develop strategies to help you be successful. what are potential barriers that may get in the way of your success and how do you plan to overcome them? it might be helpful to tell your friends your desire to quit and enlist their support in working towards your goal. no matter what don’t give up! many people have several unsuccessful attempts before they finally are able to become smoke free because quitting smoking can be an incredibly difficult thing to do for some people. the webmd smoking cessation center would be a great resource for more information and for direction on where to get more help regarding becoming smoke free. talk to your doctor for further guidance as well.	how can i stop smoking when already i'm addicted to it.? . i have stopped smoking an year ago but again smoked once due to peer pressure. but i dont want that to continue. how can i proceed. for this.?

hi gangrene is rather unusual in such small babies. the cause of gangrene needs to be found out whether its due to any dangerous infection or occlusion of the arteries. if pricking of the toes by lancet brings blood out of the toes then there is no need of amputation toes can be salvaged. only if the toes are completely blackened without having any blood supply only then they need to be amputed. salvage operations should be tried first and sincere and agressive attempts need to be made to save the toes. thanks	New born 1 month old nephew is suffering from feet gangrene doctor want to amputate toes?
"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this and i hope you get a diagnosis soon. though i'm hoping you don't have ulcerative colitis! the thing with blood is that a little can look like a lot especially when it's dispersed in a bowl of toilet water. even a couple drops of blood in the toilet can give the water the appearance a blood bath has taken place. i mention this in part to help calm your anxiety about this. the chances are you're not losing as much blood as you think. if there's any way for you to measure the blood loss (i know sounds gross but you could for example purchase from a medical supply store a ""hat"" or plastic measuring basin that fits under the toilet seat for those times when only blood comes out) you'd have a better idea of how much blood you're really losing. it's probably not more than a tablespoon or so at a time but since i'm not there to see it it could be more. it would be good for your doctor to know. losing blood is always unnerving but the human body can endure quite a lot of blood loss before serious problems occur. if you do experience fainting or if your pulse rate stays elevated then you definitely need to call your doctor. meanwhile you can help avoid those symptoms by drinking plenty of fluid to keep your circulating volume up. i wish you all the best with this!"	how much blood can you lose daily from rectal bleeding before you get other problems? ie. anemia fainting. i'm pretty sure i have ulcerative colitis but i'm still going through diagnosis with my dr.

"this is an issue of concern for many families. the law states that employer-sponsored health insurance is ""affordable"" if individual coverage doesn't exceed 9. 5% of your annual income. it doesn't include the cost of family coverage which is obviously much higher. under the law if you have an offer of affordable employer coverage you're not eligible for subsidies through the marketplaces meaning your family will have to pay the full cost of coverage with no financial assistance from the government. you can shop outside of the marketplace if you wish and if you're not eligible for a tax credit you may find broader options available to you. you can work with an agent."

the developing fetus depends on the mother to supply oxygen for growth and survival. oxygen dissolved in her blood is transferred through the placenta to the fetus. uncontrolled asthma causes a decrease in the mother’s oxygen which in turn reduces the oxygen available to the developing fetus. this may result in impaired fetal growth; it could even affect survival of the fetus. uncontrolled/severe asthma can have several serious consequences on both mom and the baby. high blood pressure preterm labor premature births seizures in the infant and lung trauma and death of the mother etc most of these are complications from either not using medications or underutilizing them while a woman is pregnant. it's important to know your personal asthma triggers and learn ways to avoid them. knowing the early signs of an attack and starting treatment right away are also critical. have an asthma plan in place and know when to go to the er. many people wait until it's too late and the symptoms are severe. this makes asthma deadly.	how does severe uncontrolled asthma adversely affect a fetus?

strep cannot be accurately diagnosed by the severity of the sore throat — it requires both a hands-on medical examination and a lab test for confirmation. medical providers who feel they can just look in the throat and accurately diagnose strep tend to be wrong half of the time; not much better than a coin toss. there are some suspicious signs of strep that one can notice by simply looking at the throat. many people get all excited when they see “white stuff” on the tonsils. this is not a definite sign of strep and can even be food particles. strep tends to cause petechiae — tiny irregularly-shaped red dots appearing on the back of the palate and on or near the uvula. the back of the throat and palate area is usually an angry-looking fire-engine red. the kids look and act sick. their breath smells like they have never used a toothbrush in their life. for those clinicians who have spent their careers insulted by this strep smell we usually have a pretty good idea that this child probably has strep. i still test them. if the rapid strep test is surprisingly negative (it is not 100%) i tend to get a throat culture. a culture takes two days but the accuracy approaches 100 percent. streptococcal infections have a bad historical reputation since it has the potential to cause heart-damaging rheumatic fever kidney disease life-threatening pneumonia and other serious complications. the reason why we treat strep when we diagnosis is to prevent these complications that are relatively rare now. if you have a good immune system our bodies can easily overcome an occasional attack of strep. kids who are excluded from school with strep should have at least 24 hours of treatment and show improvement before returning to school. treatment with antibiotics usually a penicillin-based one if you are not allergic to them will last about 10 days. there is really no need to keep children home that long. i always recommend that they change their toothbrush after a day of treatment since strep can colonize on wet toothbrushes. if you have several kids who keep their toothbrushes in the same drawer touching it is the same as sharing toothbrushes. for the teenagers i warn them about taking a clandestine swig out of the milk or orange juice container in the refrigerator when no one is watching. if a sore throat persists more than a week or so accompanied by fatigue a mono test should be considered.	what are the symptoms of strep throat?

hi i found this piece of info if this is you? during a tia one of the small blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. atherosclerosis is a common cause of narrowed arteries. it occurs when fatty deposits known as plaques develop on the inner lining of your blood vessels. this can cause your blood vessels to become thickened hard and less elastic making it more difficult for blood to flow through them. ok if this is you then simple cayenne pepper may help clear this plaque away for you there are many ways to take cayenne you can try capsules the ok but when the capsule opens inside you it can give you the cramps or like me you can mix cayenne with tomato paste and thin with olive oil to start with to a heat that suits you next time you mix you can add a bit more and so on take 3 small spoonful's each morning wash each down with water now if you want because it very good for your blood do a jar of very fine chopped garlic and keep this in olive oil just add a spoonful on top of the cayenne before you take it. all very good for you and give it a couple of weeks to start working at full strength. good luck	"should i be worried if i have symptoms of a tia occuring 5-10 times a month? . i have lupus. for the last 2 years i have been experiencing numbness and tingling on 1/2 of my face 5-10 times per month. i literally can feel a perfect line of numb vs. normal down my nose and lips on the left side. they have done mri's that have come out normal. now i am occasionally feeling numbness/tingling down my arm and leg also on the left side. i don't know if is should be worried or just chalk it up as ""yet another lupus symptom""."

osteoarthritis is a breakdown of the cartilage between our joints. symptoms including pain and stiffness usually begin after age 40. aging definitely increases the likelihood of getting osteoarthritis and if we live long enough almost everyone develops osteoarthritis to some degree. heredity can also play a role. however the degree to which you are affected is more often determined by how much you abused your joints in your younger years. your weight also makes a big difference particularly for osteoarthritis of the hips and knees. losing even a little weight can reduce symptoms and slow the progress of osteoarthritis. building strong leg muscles can also help reduce osteoarthritis of the knee.	is osteoarthritis a part of aging and is there a way to reduce risks even after age 50?

the traditional flu shot contains proteins separated from the flu virus. those proteins can't cause illness. but your immune system learns to recognize them and mounts a protective reaction if a real live flu virus tries to infect you. the flumist nasal spray works differently. it contains a live flu virus that has been weakened to the point that it can't cause the flu. that sounds pretty scary but millions of people have safely taken this kind of vaccine. the advantage of the nasal spray is that in children who have never had the flu or a flu vaccine before it seems to elicit a stronger immune response than the flu shot.	what's the difference between the nasal spray and injectable vaccines for flu?
hi a cholesterol level of below 200 is very desirable so 120 would be good. a low triglyceride level is considered less then 50mg/dl and less then 35mg/dl is considered severely low. a triglyceride blood test is the best way to figure out your level. the blood test is performed after an eight- to 12-hour period of fasting to give the most accurate results. it is important to know certain medications cause abnormal test results. so are you really sure it was 24? your hdl 59 is good so at 69 its even better for you. your ldl levels are good at 32 anything below 100 is good. you said. i am now concerned about my mood - very irritable get angry easy and prone to impulsive anxious behaviour. this sounds very much like adhd i would see your own doctor and do go over this with him/her or perhaps your doctor will pass you on to another doctor who specializes in this form of medicine. do hope this helps you. good luck	total cholesterol 120- triglycerides 24- hdl 69- ldl 32- are these counts seriously low? . i am a man aged 38. i exercise daily and am a regular in endurance sports. abut 8 years ago i had depression and anxiety issues and on going panic attacks. i am now concerned about my mood - very irritable get angry easy and prone to impulsive anxious behaviour. of course i hate this and have no real sense of stability. any ideas what i am looking at here? why are my values so low given that i have a very healthy diet and exercise daily. help.

"all children should be immunized against tetanus by receiving a series of five dtap vaccinations which generally are started at 2 months of age and completed at approximately 5 years of age. booster vaccination is recommended at 11 years of age with tdap. follow-up booster vaccination is recommended every 10 years thereafter. while a 10-year period of protection exists after the basic childhood series is completed should a potentially contaminated wound occur an ""early"" booster may be given in selected cases and the 10 years ""clock"" reset."	what is the schedule for active immunization for tetanus (tetanus shots)?
the bottom line is that aspirin is sometimes but only rarely and judicially prescribed during pregnancy. unless your doctor prescribes it you should avoid taking aspirin altogether. it is a challenge to keep up with the ever changing rules of which foods beverages and medications (including low dose aspirin) can be safely taken by pregnant woman. the use of aspirin during pregnancy is controversial and generally discouraged unless health conditions in the mother exist so that the benefits of using a low dose aspirin regimen outweigh possible risks. the risks may include: possible lengthening of both the pregnancy and labor which may lead to complications during birth aspirin interferes with a person’s blood's clotting ability. taking aspirin during pregnancy (especially after 32 weeks) can contribute to both mother and fetus bleeding. aspirin can also cause the premature closure of a baby's heart vessels which can lead to high blood pressure in the baby's lungs. increased risk of miscarriage aspirin can interact with other medications and might be dangerous for pregnant women with specific medical conditions. the benefits may include: some research has shown that certain women at high risk for preeclampsia women with chronic hypertension severe diabetes or kidney disease or women who had severe preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy may benefit from low-dose aspirin therapy. in conclusion the benefits of a pregnant taking aspirin are specific only to certain patients with specific medical needs. all medications including over-the-counter lose dose aspirin should not be taken by a pregnant woman without their doctor’s approval.	i am 23 weeks pregnant and i am taking low dose aspirin and labetaloltablet everday. is it advisable
blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. it constitutes one of the critically important signs of life or vital signs which include heart beat breathing and temperature. blood pressure is generated by the heart pumping blood into the arteries modified by the response of the arteries to the flow of blood. an individual's blood pressure is expressed as systolic/diastolic blood pressure for example 120/80. the systolic blood pressure (the top number) represents the pressure in the arteries as the muscle of the heart contracts and pumps blood into them. the diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) represents the pressure in the arteries as the muscle of the heart relaxes following its contraction. blood pressure always is higher when the heart is pumping (squeezing) than when it is relaxing. the range of systolic blood pressure for most healthy adults falls between 90 and 120 millimeters of mercury (mm hg). normal diastolic blood pressure ranges between 60 and 80 mm hg. current guidelines define normal blood pressure range as lower than 120/80. blood pressures over 130/80 are considered high. high blood pressure increases the risk of developing: heart disease kidney disease hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis) eye damage stroke low blood pressure (hypotension) is pressure so low it causes symptoms or signs due to the low flow of blood through the arteries and veins. when the flow of blood is too low to deliver enough oxygen and nutrients to vital organs such as the brain heart and kidney the organs do not function normally and may be temporarily or permanently damaged. unlike high blood pressure low blood pressure is defined primarily by signs and symptoms of low blood flow and not by a specific blood pressure number. some individuals routinely may have blood pressures of 90/50 with no symptoms and therefore do not have low blood pressure. however others who normally have higher blood pressures may develop symptoms of low blood pressure if their blood pressure drops to 100/60.	what is low blood pressure?
we are learning more and more each day about drug interactions with food especially juices like grapefruit. grapefruit juice has the ability to interact with certain enzymes in the body – the same enzymes that help break down medicines like statins so your body can use them. this can lead to high levels of the drug in the body and lead to a variety of health problems. it is best to avoid grapefruit while on this class of medications. you can also talk to your doctor or health- care provider to see if you can be switched to a different class of medications for your cholesterol; we have a few other options besides statins. .	can i ever have grapefruit again if i take a statin?

it is great that you have had exellent results from your surgical procedures. you are wise to try to get moving and active again. being fit and active is the best thing that you can do to prevent future problems with your back. however it is important that you develop a progressive aerobic and strengthening regimen. i would suggest that you contact your surgeon for a referral to a spine physical therapist who can help you get started on your return to exercise. in general you want to avoid impact type exercises so the elliptical is a reasonable option. you should also avoid any heavy weights particularly free weights above your head that will cause compression to the spine. i usually recommend that spine patients use the weight machines that use resistence mechanisms or weights on tracks with pulleys. these are less likey to injury you. you also need to do regular core muscle strengthening. again a physical therapist can help you get started. pilates is the commercial exercise course that is most similar to a core strengthening program.	i have had two back surgeries and am pain-free except for some stiffness. what exercises can i do to play tennis again?

studies of the effects of exercise in preventing heart attacks have yielded conflicting results. this is likely because of the fact that people who exercise regularly generally have healthier lifestyles. many risk factors for heart disease -- weight blood pressure diabetes blood cholesterol and smoking -- can be influenced by exercise. therefore the specific role of exercise itself in heart attack prevention is difficult to isolate.	can exercise prevent a heart attack?

yes. a doctor can take a sample from what appears to be a herpes sore and examine it under a microscope. you can also have a blood test. the blood test looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system would have made when you were infected. hsv-2 almost always infects the genitals so if antibodies to hsv-2 are detected in your blood you probably have genital herpes. a blood test that shows antibodies to hsv-1 means you could have genital or oral herpes. that's because oral herpes typically caused by hsv-1 can be spread to the genitals during oral sex.	is there a test for genital herpes?

"wart treatments require patience. how well wart treatments work is another matter. warts can appear and disappear without an identifiable cause and may disappear on their own without treatment. some warts sprout offshoots near the main wart and others don't. some hurt and others are painless. certain warts even of the same type respond to treatment while others (even on the same person at the same time) don't. all treatment methods often require many sessions over weeks months or longer to succeed. here is a practical approach to the treatment of warts: 1. if you can ignore your warts do so. eventually they'll go away (although eventually can mean a long time -- even months or years). 2. if you have an easy case (a single wart on the face or one or a few on the hands) see a doctor for a quick freeze or electrical zap. this method is simple almost painless and non-scarring. 3. if you have a hard case you can start by treating the warts for a few weeks on your own. examples: plantar warts: warts on the bottom of the foot feel deep but they are still within the superficial layer of the skin. salicylic-acid drops and plasters help remove the thick overlying callus and make the wart feel less like a marble in your shoe. nonprescription aerosol freezing may be used as well. common hand warts: these are typically unattractive although not painful. salicylic acid can make them smaller and go away in some cases as can nonprescription freezing. if you have an all-but-impossible case don't try too hard. you don't want to make the treatment worse than the disease. examples: warts under the nails: these are extremely resistant to treatment. one or two tries by the doctor are worth a shot but if they fail putting acid on them yourself just makes them look rough and unattractive. ""mosaic"" warts: tiny so-called seed warts can proliferate by the dozens or hundreds all over the sole of the foot. they don't usually hurt and they rarely respond to any sort of treatment although in this case too one or two tries at treatment may be in order. flat warts: these are small flat flesh-colored pimples and may be numerous on one part of the body (for example on the face arms or groin). getting rid of them by a light application of salicylic acid or other method is easy enough but they have a tendency to recur."	are wart treatments effective?

don't let her intimidate you into not putting them on her plate. in order for a child to eat a vegetable they must first tolerate the appearance of the vegetable. after a while you may talk her into touching them. smelling them. or even putting them on her tongue. eventually you can work up to getting her to eat a tiny piece. then a whole one. and then finally she may eat a full serving. it can take a while so be patient. don't use threats but you can use rewards if she understands money. give her about $10 worth of quarters and tell her she can spend them on on a toy. if she has any left at the end of the week. if she refuses to eat a green bean she can pay you with a few quarters. as she sees her stash going down she may reconsider and just eat one. in the meantime learn to puree them in her food. hide cooked vegetables in hamburger meat spaghetti or pizza sauce meatloaf etc. use veggie hot dogs. you can even give her gummi veggies. don't give up. you will win this battle eventually.	how do i get my 4 year old to eat vegetables? . she is a picky eater to begin with but i have tried letting her pick out the veggies when we shop and help me prepare them. i have tried steaming blanching saute and raw. i just don't want veggies to be a battle. i'm afraid she will never eat them.

schizophrenia is a brain disorder that affects some 2. 2 million american adults most often before the age of 30. it interferes with the way a person acts thinks and feels and frequently causes difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what is imaginary. this in turn makes patients prone to delusional beliefs about themselves or others. schizophrenia also affects ordered thinking making it difficult to concentrate maintain attention span or develop normal motivation. it can also affect the ability to experience normal emotions in social situations often causing a person to become unusually unresponsive or withdrawn.	what is schizophrenia?

whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred. when inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade (99. 9 oral temperature) fever due to the body working hard to heal itself. sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual. as for the chest pain it could be associated with his arm being hurt but it depends on how he fell how far he fell and exactly how he landed. he could have injured more than originally thought. for temporary relief he should try r. i. c. e. (rest ice compression elevation) and perhaps some ibuprofen (motrin advil) to reduce swelling/pain/fever. acetaminophine (tylenol) should be fine as well if that works better for him but it doesn't have an anti-inflammatory component like ibuprofen does. ultimately the best thing to do is to see a physician just to be certain that everything is alright and there isn't something more serious occurring. most urgent care facilities will see you same day with or without insurance. emergency departments will as well but they are usually more congested and expensive. i hope this helps. best of luck to you!

i'm glad you asked because many others will benefit. you should be just fine taking this combination of medications. you may feel drowsier than normal. and anyone who is taking a narcotic (hydrocodone) should either not drive or else be very cautious when driving because driving under the influence of narcotics is prohibited in many states and local jurisdictions. in general though you're not at high risk from taking this combination of meds at these dosages. in the future i'd recommend you ask your health care provider about possible drug interactions at the time you're prescribed a narcotic. also you can always consult a pharmacist for advice. i hope your ankle heals quickly! it is definitely safe. you want to be careful to see how they interact with each other at a time when you can lay down if necessary. i take four 1 mg xanax a day and two 7. 5/325 mg of norco (hydrocodone) everyday. make sure your doctors are aware of your medical history and all medications.	is it safe to take hydroco 5/325 and. 5mg xanax? . i was in an auto accident and broke my ankle/foot wrist and had internal abdomonal injuries and was prescribed hydroco 5/325 for pain. i also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and have been taking. 5 mg of alprazolam per day. are these two medications safe to take at the same time? i take 1 hydroco 5/325 tablet every 4-6 hours for pain and take. 5mg alprazolam per day.

prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in american men and the second leading cause of deaths from cancer after lung cancer. the estimated lifetime risk of being diagnosed with the disease is 17. 6% for caucasians and 20. 6% for african americans. the lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer similarly is 2. 8% and 4. 7% respectively. as reflected in these numbers prostate cancer is likely to impact the lives of a significant proportion of men that are alive today. over the years however the death rate from this disease has shown a steady decline and currently more than 2 million men in the u. s. are still alive after being diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lives. although it is subject to some controversy many experts in this field therefore recommend that beginning at age 40 all men should undergo screening for prostate cancer.	why is it important to diagnose prostate cancer early?

"remember that any fever in a newborn infant (under 3 months of age) needs prompt medical attention because at that age it’s hard to tell when a serious infection might be present. a fever is the body’s natural response to infection or other illness and will subside when the underlying process gets better. other than treating the infection (or other condition) causing it no home treatments can shorten the duration of a fever. also remember that fever doesn’t always need to be treated. if a toddler is acting normally and unbothered by her fever and her temperature is less than 104 degrees (40 degrees celsius) there’s no need to treat the fever. for a fever that’s high or is bothering your toddler either acetaminophen (mapap tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) are good treatments. you’ll need to know your toddler’s weight (don’t guess) and use the dosing guidelines on the package. it’s best to stick with one medicine if you can. if you feel you need to use multiple drugs call your pediatrician’s office. don’t ever use aspirin to treat a child’s fever as it increases the risk for reye’s syndrome. if sponging with water helps your child with a fever feel better use a warm bath (not cool) with water around 85 degrees. i know it sounds weird but my great granny used to cut an onion in half and put one half on the bottom of each foot then cover with socks and leave them on me all night. (in addition to tylenol or advil) when i would wake up in the morning my fever would be gone (or at least drasticly reduced) and the onions in my socks would be black. she said the onions drew the fever away from the brain and other vital organs. i don't unserstand how it works but i used this on my children and now on my grands and it works every time. it helps to understand what a fever is. some of the answers on here are very misleading and aren't factual at all. a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature. most common cause of this is an infection of some kind. the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body. the brain has a set point for our temperature 98. 6f. it is like a central heating/cooling system with a thermostat in a house. if the temp gets hot the a/c turns on. if it gets to cold the heater kicks on. and the temperature stays at 98. 6f. what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat. so the brain now has a set point of 101 f. but the body is still 98. 6 f. so the heater kicks on. you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat. you feel cold and you get under covers to get warm. this is why people say they are so cold when their temp is 100 because the thermostat is set to 101 or higher. the body does this because some of the bodies defenses are activated at higher temperatures and some bacteria don't function well at higher temperatures. so they die or we kill them better with a higher temperature. so what is it when a fever ""breaks""? well eventually your white blood cells kill everything and they stop releasing those chemicals that changes the thermostat. so the thermostat changes back to 98. 6f. now you have a temperature of 101f and your body is set to 98. 6f. it is too hot. turn on the a/c. so you start sweating to cool yourself off. this is a fever ""breaking"". so when the person with the fever is sweating like there is no tomorrow it is a good thing and you can probably expect the fever to start going back down. fever is a natural defense mechanism against foreign invaders of your body. it is very normal. as long as my fever isn't over 102f it makes sense to me to not interfere with the natural process. even help it. if i'm running a little fever i'll get in the hot tub or a nice hot bath. fevers can be very dangerous and you should ask your doctor when those dangerous temperatures are. they are different for kids and adults. to answer the question the fastest easiest way to break a fever is with anti-inflammatory medications like tylenol and motrin. but that doesn't mean everything is all better. and by the way: water is zero calories! (in case you read the other post) don't believe any of that stuff. what i do is rub my baby down with green rubbing alcohol. it works every time. a fever is not your body fighting an infection. anything that heats up your body including heat and induces sweating causes a fever. fevers cause heat exhaustion and heat stroke as heat heats up the body inducing sweating wich causes water to be ejected from the body. you may induce a fever and prove this by simply visiting a steam room and when your sweating check your temp youll have a fever. you may also go out jogging and see when your hot and sweating you have a fever with a fever thermometer. if you do either for long periods youll eventualy drop from exhaustion enjoying before that mild to severe dehydration symptoms heat exhaustion and heat stroke and possible mild heart attacks. cardio excersize and steam rooms have been around for centuries inducing fever and not cured any disease other than treat obesity. your heartrate can generate heat and cause a fever by pumping friction wich happens during jogging just like shaking a pop can or rubbing your hands generates warmth. make sure you maintain bodyweight during a fever. if food poisioning is suspect having a person stomach pumped and an enema given may be needed if fatigue sets in. fluid calories are better during a fever its important to maintain heartrate as lowering your heartrate also induces fatigue. if a fever is starting with no fatigue water may be ok. its important to keep dry and keep cool (keeping dry to avoid chills). humans thrive in cool temp climates of 55-65 degrees thier is little life in deserts do to heat heat starves an area of water. for children its important that children playing maintain thier bodyweight during excersize/play and eat and drink and take rest breaks and normalize thier heartrate reducing sweating. if people have to loose weight then i recommend simply getting out and walking bringing food fluids before or during thier walk to avoid dehydration with rest breaks. obesity causes fever and dehydration by carrying around 50-100 lb weights. you may simulate obesity by carrying a backpack of 50-100+ lb barebell weights and grow it daily and see what affects that has on your health. weather and activie levels can affect weight loss. people eat drink and rest to maintain thier heartrate and energy levels. in a virus or poision a fever is a response to excess blood volume wich causes your heart to pump harder and faster generating heat. you may simulate this by giving an unnecessary blood transfusion wich will likely cause a fever and may cause a mild heart attack so i wouldnt advise it. water causes weight gain at 1/2 lb a cup its a myth its zero caloric. overdrinking from dehydrationcan cause excessive urination in addition to lowering your heartrate further so cold water if a fever has started with no fatigue otherwise fluid calories."	how do you break a fever in a toddler?

since the 1930s when milk was first fortified with vitamin d to prevent rickets the usual recommendation has been 200 iu to 400 iu daily during times of inadequate sun exposure. women above age 50 should be receiving 400 iu to 800 iu. recently experts in the area have been lobbying for a new recommended level of 1 000 iu daily among adults. the food and nutritional board at the institute of medicine began reviewing the published studies in 2008. . . for comparison the upper tolerable limit (adverse results begin to appear) has been reputed to be 2 000 iu/day. many researchers in the field have suggested that the toxic level is closer to 10 000 iu/day over a more prolonged period of time.	how much vitamin d is recommended?

it is important to rest the stomach and yet still avoid dehydration. clear fluids should be attempted for the first 24 hours of an illness and then the diet should be advanced as tolerated. clear fluids are easy for the stomach to absorb and include: water sports drinks clear broths popsicles jello. it is important not to take too much fluid at one time since stretching the stomach may cause the nausea to worsen. one to two ounces of fluid at a time taken every 10 to 15 minutes may be all that the stomach will be able to tolerate. milk products should be avoided for the first 24 to 48 hours during an episode of nausea and vomiting. the enzyme that helps digest milk is located in cells lining the stomach. with vomiting the body can become relatively lactose intolerant. abdominal pain bloating vomiting and diarrhea may occur.	what can i do at home for nausea or vomiting?

"first off let me just clarify that not everyone who takes a diuretic (""water pill"") needs to take a potassium supplement. diuretics come in two general types: potassium-sparing and non-potassium-sparing (also called ""loop diuretics""). most of the newer diuretics are potassium-sparing which means they do not strip potassium from the body the way loop diuretics do. the reason i want to clarify this is because patients who take loop diuretics like lasix (furosemide) should always receive a prescription for potassium from their doctor. if you are taking a diuretic and did not receive a prescription for potassium they you may not need to take any extra potassium. potassium is a key mineral for heart health. but too much or too little potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat. thus it's not always a good idea to take a potassium supplement. if a person wants to make sure they are getting enough potassium they should consider eating potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauces and beans. this is a safer way to get potassium than taking a pill -- unless a medical professional tells you to take a pill. wishing you well!"	how effective is the otc potassium gluconate for copd patients on diurectics?

if you have heart failure: be sure any exercise is paced and balanced with rest. avoid isometric exercises such as push-ups and sit-ups. isometric exercises involve straining muscles against other muscles or an immovable object. don't exercise outdoors when it is too cold hot or humid. high humidity may cause you to tire more quickly; extreme temperatures can interfere with circulation make breathing difficult and cause chest pain. better choices are indoor activities such as mall walking. make sure you stay hydrated. it is important to drink water even before you feel thirsty especially on hot days. but be careful not to drink too much water. follow your doctor's guidelines about how much fluid you can have in a day. extremely hot and cold showers or sauna baths should be avoided after exercise. these extreme temperatures increase the workload on the heart. steer clear of exercise in hilly areas. if you must walk in steep areas make sure you slow down when going uphill to avoid working too hard. monitor your heart rate closely. if your exercise program has been interrupted for a few days (for example due to illness vacation or bad weather) make sure you ease back into the routine. start with a reduced level of activity and gradually increase it until you are back where you started.	what are some general workout tips for people with heart failure?

"in coronary artery disease (coronary atherosclerosis) injury to the intima of the artery leads to the formation of plaques which are regions of thickening on the inner lining of the artery. how then do the plaques form? in response to the injury the smooth muscle cells from the media and perhaps from the adventitia move (migrate) into the intima. in the intima these smcs reproduce themselves (divide) and make (synthesize) connective tissue. these processes of migration division and synthesis which collectively are referred to as intimal proliferation (build-up) cause thickening of the intima. when cholesterol other fats and inflammatory cells such as white blood cells enter the proliferating thickened intima the result is an atherosclerotic plaque. then as these plaques grow they accumulate scar (fibrous) tissue and abundant calcium. (calcium is the hard material in our teeth and bones. ) hence the plaques are often hard which is why atherosclerosis is sometimes referred to as ""hardening of the arteries.

dextromethorophan is a cough suppressant; guaifenesin is a mucous-thinning medication that can actually increase a cough. if you goal is to stop/control a cough especially at night then dextromethorophan (assuming it is not included in a combination product containing a decongestant) is what you would use. if you goal is to thin a cough so that a person can spit it up then guaifenesin (during the day) would be helpful if the person is capable of coughing up phlegm. children often cannot do this. guaifenesin at bedtime will most likely increase the cough because of post-nasal drainage.	when do you use dextromethorphan vs guaifenesin

your doctor is right in saying that your son has allergic conjunctivitis. eye allergies called allergic conjunctivitis are a common condition that occurs when the eyes react to something that irritates them called an allergen. the most common allergens are dust and pollens. the eyes produce a substance called histamine to fight off the allergen. as a result the eyelids and conjunctiva (the thin filmy membrane that covers the inside of your eyelids) become red swollen and itchy with tearing and burning. the key to treating eye allergies are avoid or limit contact with the substance causing the problem. avoid rubbing eyes instead do cold compresses. use antiallergic eye drop like olopatadine along with lubricating eye drop. we prescribe mild steroid in pulse dose in case allergy is severe. in longstanding allergy we also prescribe tacrolimus (talimus ointment) with very good results. some doctors also prescribe cyclosporine instead of tacrolimus and that is also effective in longstanding cases. this will help you and i am very sorry to say that there is no medicine to cure allergy. only way is to stay away from all those things that you are allergic to. also this allergy will trouble him every year and usually after puberty it decreases. for further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My 3 year old son has eye allergy for over two months now.

i don't think you have anything to worry about. when a man actually ejaculates into a woman the ejaculation forces the sperm up there to impregnate her so it is very unlikely that just a tiny bit of precum on your underwear would get you pregnant. even if you had a whole load of semen in your underwear it would still be very unlikely to cause a pregnancy.	gave a guy a hand job and touched a little precum. had to end it early so i put my underwear on a couple minutes later. okay so we had to cut it a bit short so nothing really happened. i just touched his precum. a couple minutes later i put my clothes back on and thennn my underwear with my hands that had precum. could i posssiibly maybe somehow get pregnant?

there are several effective treatments for shingles. drugs that fight viruses (antivirals) such as acyclovir (zovirax) valacyclovir (valtrex) or famciclovir (famvir) can reduce the severity and duration of the rash if started early (within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash). in addition to antiviral medications pain medications may be needed for symptom control. both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and narcotic pain-control medications may be used for pain management in shingles. the affected area should be kept clean. bathing is permitted and the area can be cleansed with soap and water. cool compresses and anti-itching lotions such as calamine lotion may also provide relief. an aluminum acetate solution (burow's or domeboro solution available at your pharmacy) can be used to help dry up the blisters and oozing. in may 2006 the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) approved the first vaccine for adult shingles. the vaccine developed by merck laboratories and known as zostavax is approved for use in adults ages 60 and over who have had chickenpox. the shingles vaccine contains a booster dose of the chickenpox vaccine usually given to children. tests over an initial four-year period showed that the vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of shingles in these older adults. the single-dose vaccine was shown to be more than 60% effective in reducing shingles symptoms and it reduced the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (phn see above) by at least two-thirds. studies are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine over a longer term. there are certain contraindications to receiving the shingles vaccine. people with weakened immune systems due to immune-suppressing medications cancer treatment hiv disease or organ transplants should not receive the shingles vaccine because it contains live weakened viral particles. there is not enough information available from researchers to decide at this point whether zostavax may be beneficial in people younger than 60 years of age. since the chickenpox vaccine is now recommended for children the incidence of chickenpox has been reduced. this is also expected to reduce the incidence of shingles in adults in the future as these vaccinated children age.	can shingles be prevented with a vaccine?

it's not a great idea. although the jury is still out on this subject most energy drinks come with a warning that pregnant women children and those sensitive to caffeine shouldn’t drink them. there are many negative nutritional consequences associated with most energy drinks. as you may know keeping your weight under control during pregnancy is critical to your health and that of your unborn baby. unless they are low in sugar or reduced / lo-carb these beverages are loaded with sugar and empty calories. energy drinks also contain too much sodium which may lead to fluid retention hypertension and electrolyte irregularities. besides caffeine these drinks may also contain contain an ingredient called taurine ;although it occurs naturally in the body it may cause tachycardia and heart palpations. some taurine used in these drinks is artificial and may lead to seizures and other organ disturbances. as you may also know the unborn baby is also receiving this chemical ingredient and may experience the same negative cardiac effects. energy drinks contain other preservatives flavors and coloring chemicals that may also be injurious to you and your unborn child. please discuss this question with your obstetrics and gemological professional before consuming this beverage.	is it safe for me to drink a monster energy drink while im pregnant?

baby : your baby measures about 10. 4 inches from crown to rump or a total length of about 16. 7 inches from head to toe and weighs about 2. 7 pounds. at this stage a fetus's eyes are almost always blue and can distinguish bright sunlight or artificial light through the uterine wall. baby is performing fewer acrobatics as conditions in the womb become more cramped but still doing a lot of kicking and stretching. mom-to-be : your uterus is about 3. 5 to 4 inches above your navel. weight gain is probably between 19 and 25 pounds. as odds improve that baby could survive outside the womb -- although in a neonatal intensive-care unit -- you may be feeling relieved and excited or anxious about motherhood your baby's health and labor and delivery. if you do experience premature labor signs include menstrual-like cramps or lower back pain a trickle of amniotic fluid or a watery pinkish or brownish discharge preceded sometimes by the passage of a thick gelatinous mucus plug. your practitioner often can stop labor from progressing with bed rest muscle relaxants or other drugs possibly requiring hospitalization. tip of the week : your blood pressure typically may rise a little around the seventh month but contact your practitioner if you get severe headaches blurred vision or severe swelling of hands feet or ankles or if you experience severe weight gain. these symptoms could signal the beginning of preeclampsia a dangerous condition marked by high blood pressure and high levels of protein in the urine during pregnancy.	what can i expect during week 29 of my pregnancy?
the basic cause of heartburn is an underactive lower esophageal sphincter or les that doesn't tighten as it should. two excesses often contribute to this problem: too much food in the stomach (overeating) or too much pressure on the stomach (frequently from obesity or pregnancy). certain foods commonly relax the les including tomatoes citrus fruits garlic onions chocolate coffee alcohol caffeinated products and peppermint. dishes high in fats and oils (animal or vegetable) often lead to heartburn as do certain medications. stress increases acid production and can cause heartburn. and smoking which relaxes the les and stimulates stomach acid is a major contributor.	what causes heartburn?

this is a problem to be solved by a team approach. first see a derm and an endocrinologist. they together will check for hormonal imbalances such as pcos -- pcos (polycystic ovarian disease) which can result in excessive body hair and facial hair. it can also be accompanied by cystic acne and weight gain. there are many other causes of excess hair growth. sometimes it is genetic or cause from certain medications. some ethnicities grow darker thicker hairs as well. in general a routine blood test to look for pcos and other abnormalities can lead to a simple treatment with a medication and as well laser hair removal. . remember - please see an endocrinologist and a dermatologist as well as your gynecologist. stick with board-certified physicians.	what type of docotor can help me get rid of unwanted facial hair on my cheeks chin and neck?

"hello! there is a slim chance you could be pregnant. however; i don't believe that you are. not unless the condom ( i'm assuming that is what you used? ) broke tore or was defective in some way. which you'd probably notice upon disposal. i think that you are late and now that your stressing about a maybe baby your period is being delayed more so. so lady i say relax! grab yourself a glass of wine a hot bath and good book and try not to think about it. i know it ""sounds"" easier said than done. but worrying isn't going to help you. believe me honey i have been where you are a few times. up until finally getting my period on the very last day of the month or on the first of the next! i wouldn't re- take another test until you haven't received a period by the next month. if it still comes up negative make yourself a doctors appointment if nothing else hearing that your not pregnant from a license doctor along with figuring out whats up with your wonky menstrual cycle will put you at ease."	could i be pregnant? . cycle is 27/28 days long. last period was on 4/26. next period is due on 5/23. i had protected sex on 5/10 actually 5/11 which is the last day that i was supposed to be ovulating. i have had period/ovulation like cramps for about a week now but yet no period. sometimes my period comes a day or two early so at this point i am really getting paranoid. i took an early response test today 5/22 and it came out negative. could me stressing about this be causing the delay in my period to start.
try eating smaller meals and don't eat two to three hours before bedtime. avoid foods that may trigger heartburn such as fried food citrus tomato spices peppermint chocolate and carbonated drinks. cut back on alcohol and caffeine. stop smoking if you smoke. lose weight if your doctor says you're overweight. cut back on aspirin and pain relievers if you take them often. consider trying over-the-counter antacids such as maalox or tums; acid blockers like axid pepcid tagamet and zantac; or a proton pump inhibitor like prilosec. one final precaution: always talk to your doctor about any chest pain that you may have. sometimes a mild heart attack can masquerade as heartburn and people have ignored chest pain that was really a heart attack.	how do i treat frequent heartburn?

i have to say that being overweight is definitely a factor but there are soooo many reasons for shortness of breath in children that it would be wrong to just attribute it to his weight. his doctor needs to do some pulmonary function tests or refer him to someone who can do this. shortness of breath due to exercise can be cardiac (heart) as well as an example. he may need more than just a rescue inhaler like albuterol to manage this problem but you would be wise to take his medical evaluation up a notch. i do agree with what rod moser has said but i do like to add few more things to this that inhalers are just not the available solution for every problem. keeping in consideration the age of your child i will suggest him some deep breath exercise like :- the stimulating breath (also called the bellows breath) the 4-7-8 (or relaxing breath) exercise breath counting. once he will be fine with these he push himself further more with some more deep breath exercise. for more information you can visit pharmacysell	could my child's shortness of breath be related to him being over weight somewhat? . my child is 9 years old and somewhat overweight. he has shortness of breath all the time not just during activity. he goes around taking in deep breaths a lot and i can tell he isn't getting proper air. he uses his inhaler daily. my husband thinks its because he is overweight but i am concerned. he was put on inhaler because he may have exercised induced asthma the doctor said but that was when he was 7 years old. could this type of shortness of breath be caused by overweight? .

this is a question that i think is great. because one of the things that i recommend to patients is they need to see their doctor or healthcare provider first. as we may know a lot of over-the-counter yeast infection treatments are available and a person can pick them up anywhere. but when you are pregnant you want to go see your doctor to make sure that there is nothing else going on and also certain creams are preferred in pregnant women. so it maybe a cream or suppository you may walk out with a prescription or he may give you a recommendation for one of the approved products which is monistat which is available over-the-counter. but the physician or healthcare provider really needs to be involved in that. if you have any questions or are unsure just come and talk to us we will be more than happy to help you.	how should i treat any yeast infections i get while i am pregnant?
believe it or not when you walk into a room what your eye sees can actually determine whether or not you’re going to have an easy time falling asleep or a bad time. so the first thing i tell people to do is clean up your bedroom. get the clutter out. because it’s pretty hard to fall asleep with a stack of laundry over here and a big pile of books over there and a very sort of jumbled night table okay. and so i talk to them about cleaning up the clutter getting that stuff out of the way so that when you walk in you’re more peaceful more serene surrounding. that may also have to do with color. so there are studies that look at what is the color of your bedroom and how can that affect your ability to fall asleep. it turned out that the color itself is not important but the hue of the color is. so the brightness of that color turns out to be a big factor. so when you’re painting your bedroom you don’t want a high gloss finish you want more of a matted finish. now granted a very bright yellow is probably not a great place to fall asleep but a more muted yellow probably is. so again it may not matter the color so much as the brightness of that color.	how does a messy bedroom affect my sleep?
several medications may help fight knee pain and in some cases the inflammation that can cause joint swelling and discomfort. they include: acetaminophen (tylenol). this is the first medication to try as a knee oa (osteoarthritis) treatment say arthritis specialists. that’s because it’s relatively safe compared to other pain relievers although too much can cause liver damage. acetaminophen doesn’t lessen inflammation. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). these can help relieve pain and fight inflammation that may be adding to your pain. there are prescription nsaids your doctor can prescribe. available over-the-counter ibuprofen (advil motrin ib) ketoprofen (orudis kt) and naproxen (aleve) are among your other options for pain relief. other analgesics. when other pain-relievers fail to control pain your doctor may prescribe stronger analgesics. these include tramadol (ultram) and acetaminophen with codeine (tylenol with codeine).	what oral medications are used to treat osteoarthritis?

based on a set of criteria a hga1c level between 5. 7-6. 4% is prediabetes. this means that there's an increased risk for developing overt diabetes. a person with prediabetes may have a normal blood sugar but only because their body has compensated for this with an increase in the amount of insulin produced. as prediabetes progresses the overproduction of insulin just won't be enough to compensate for high sugars and they become overtly abnormal and elevated. people with type 2 diabetes can have normal blood sugars but the metabolic abnormalities that occur will continue: insulin will continue to be produced in excess amounts. at some point it fails. and having either prediabetes or diabetes means your risk of heart disease is significantly above normal. you should modify the risks that you have: improved nutrition with calorie restriction and more fruits and veggies manage excess weight look for stress reduction methods and make good sleep a priority. seek help from a diabetes team. there are tons of information online and numerous organizations that help.

most helpful answer that's an excellent question and i'm glad you asked. first of all it's important to realize experiencing a severe headache while taking a blood thinner can be a sign of a medical emergency especially if it's accompanied by sudden weakness dizziness confusion or the inability to speak clearly. in that case you should call 911. as you probably know all the over-the-counter headache remedies called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) have blood-thinning properties. therefore it may not be a good idea to combine them with a prescription anticoagulant (blood thinner). nsaids include aspirin ibuprofen and naproxyn. read the label of any brand name medication to see if it contains any of these. so what does that leave you with? acetaminophen (tylenol) is the primary over-the-counter pain reliever that does not contain an nsaid. assuming you're not allergic to it you can try taking plain acetaminophen to see if that helps your headache. your best bet is to call your medical provider to find out what he or she recommends for a simple headache when you're taking a blood thinner. wishing you all the best!	im on blood thinner what can i take for a headache

the thick yellow blood-tinged discharge could be an indication of an infection although mucous stagnation in the sinuses can create yellow drainage as well. most sinus infections are viral and should be improving in about a week. if you are not improving this could be another indication that you may have a secondary bacterial component at play. give your medical provider a call for patient-specific advice.	sinusitis: nasal discharge after tx. diagnosed with sinusitis. treated for 5 days with fluticasone propionate nasal spray. on day four started to blow out egg yolk colored discharge and some blood. is this old infection coming out? is this normal?
milia also known as whiteheads are very common white pimples that can occur in persons of all ages. they appear mostly on the upper cheeks nose and chin of infants. this occurs when dead skin cells and sebaceous matter gets trapped near the skin surface rather than exfoliating naturally. common causes of milia include the use of thick and heavy cosmetics or poor-quality products that are not suitable for the skin that prevent the sloughing-off of dead skin cells. excessive sun exposure makes the skin thick which leaves it unable to exfoliate naturally.	what causes milia? how can i avoid getting these?

a lot will depend on what the cause of the eczema is. if your eczema is caused by contact allergies you want to use the purest gentlest shampoo you can find - like baby shampoo. if it's seborrheic dermatitis which gives you dandruff and oily yellowish flakes a shampoo that has salicylic acid in it can be very good. a good brand is denorex. it's nice and soothing for an itchy scalp and it smells good. some people swear by tar shampoo so you might want to try that too. generally though the fewer additives and the gentler the shampoo the better.	whst is a good shampoo for eczeama?

to avoid falling ill on your vacation: take care. schedule a full 24 hours after landing in your new location to unwind sleep and take care of yourself. a nonstop mentality wears down our immune systems and lowers our resistance to staving off infectious diseases. take flight. it's true that spending time in confined spaces can expose us to infection. but modern aircraft use excellent filters: 50% of the air is fresh and the other 50% has almost all of the infectious particles filtered out. so while it might be bad news to sit right next to someone who is obviously sick most of us will do just fine on the plane itself.	how can i avoid getting sick on vacation?

a hernia is an opening or weakness in the muscular structure of the wall of the abdomen. this defect causes a bulging of the abdominal wall. this bulging is usually more noticeable when the abdominal muscles are tightened thereby increasing the pressure in the abdomen. any activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure can worsen a hernia; examples of such activities are lifting coughing or even straining to have a bowel movement. imagine a barrel with a hole in its side and a balloon that is blown up inside the barrel. part of the inflated balloon would bulge out through the hole. the balloon going through the hole is like the tissues of the abdomen bulging through a hernia. serious complications from a hernia can result from the trapping of tissues in the hernia -- a process called incarceration. trapped or incarcerated tissues may have their blood supply cut off leading to damage or death of the tissue. the treatment of an incarceration usually involves surgery.	what is a hernia?

if the eel was fumigated maybe that's causing a bit of an issue. honestly your case of the nerves over being forced to eat something is likely to be the main cause of this especially if they are not having diarrhea. or you could have gotten it from some other issue that's happening at the same time. sushi and sashimi have to be prepared under some pretty high standards in most cases i'd trust it more than a regular hamburger.	diarrhea worried about anisakis. yesterday i went to an asian restaurant and my friends basically forced me into eating eel sushi roll i think it was fumigated due to the color and taste but i think it was raw. now this morning i got diarrhea and i'm burping a lot (sorry if i was so explicit but couldn't put that in any other way) and got a little bit of gastric acidity. now i don't think i have nausea i have a weird feel but it's probably because i'm stressing about it and i am a hypochondriac so it could be related to that.

the chance of an unintentional pregnancy is certainly less but not zero. while you may not be ovulating at that time sperm can remain viable inside the female reproductive tract for several days to a week. just loitering around waiting for an egg (ovum) to appear. don't do this again. if you are going to have sex either insist on your partner to use a condom 100% of the time or you need to be taking a more effective form of contraception. unprotected sex is not worth the worry and anxiety that it causes. be smart or you may eventually become pregnant. your body is designed for it.	i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend the day after my period can i be pregnant
oxycodone is an opiate. morphine is also an opiate. drug tests often cannot distinguish between the type of opiate that is detected so as long as you are taking prescribed medication there is not cause for concern. drug screenings are very odd. i bought home tests to screen my boys for drugs. it came pack positive for both of them for pcp. that was so terribly wrong that they laughed and confessed it was only marijuana. i was relieved but still not happy. i don't know how you would validate any test being better than another but i don't trust them.	i too am on oxycodone and clonazepam pain management had a urine test positive for morphine which i've never taken.

most helpful answer there is really no medical way to suppress sexual desire -- a normal human response -- no more that you can permanently suppress hunger or the need to urinate. there are drugs that can curtain the production of testosterone but i would not see any medical provider giving this to you to suppress your sexual desires. just because you have the desire in no way compels you to have sex if you don't want to. having a castration would control desire but again i would think this would be wrong. very wrong. perhaps it would be best for you to seek some counseling.	how can i supress sexual desire? . i am divorced and have a 2 yr old son. my ex-wife moved on and i have absolutely no dsire to ever make that mistake again. i would like to know if there is a medication that i can take that will supress sexual desire. if i need to get a prescription i will do that. i would rather not bother with sex anymore. i am too old to date and just don't see the need for it anymore. is there something that i can take to get rid of this annoyance?
your health care costs may go up -- they tend to every year -- but not much of the higher costs are likely to be because of health reform. employers continue to shift more health care costs onto employees as a way of keeping their own costs under control. and despite the high cost because employers tend to cover a big portion of your premium and because your employer-sponsored health insurance is a tax-free benefit it's often the best deal in town. still you may want to consider other plan options if your employer gives you a choice. there may be another alternative that will cost you less money but still cover your medical needs. you can read further about employer vs. marketplace plans at the health reform 101 blog: <link>.	my wife and myself are insured through her employer's health insurance plan. . we pay over $800 per month for coverage. will we be paying more or less or will the new laws affect it?

yes if you have symptoms and you think theres a pretty good chance you might be. go to the nearest hospital to you and get a blood test. sometimes the home test dont tell you because of your hormones and it just might be too early for it to tell. and if you get a blood test just in case check for anything else like std's and to see if you can have kids.	is there a way to tell if i am pregnant even if the home test say i am not?
when people tell me that they sleep a large number of minutes but they still feel tired there’s a few things we can look at. number one is could they have a sleep disorder like narcolepsy where they actually need more sleep than the average person would need and are they not sleeping enough and that’s one of the things making them tired? have they had a recent physical do they have iron poor blood or anemia and are they having difficulty telling the time between fatigue from anemia verses sleepiness? could they have an underlying medical condition that’s causing this a low grade fever things of that nature? and then are they really getting the quality sleep that would allow them to feel better the next day? so do they have allergies that are causing poor sleep at night? are they having pets in the bed that could be causing problems with sleep? all are different things that again could decrease your quality of sleep which might make you sleepy during the day.	i’m sleeping but i’m always tired what’s wrong with me?

"in addition to the depth of the burn the total area of the burn is significant. burns are measured as a percentage of total body area affected. the ""rule of nines"" is often used though this measurement is adjusted for infants and children. this calculation is based upon the fact that the surface area of the following parts of an adult body each correspond to approximately 9% of total (and the total body area of 100% is achieved): head = 9%. chest (front) = 9%. abdomen (front) = 9%. upper/mid/low back and buttocks = 18%. each arm = 9%. each palm = 1%. groin = 1%. each leg = 18% total (front = 9% back = 9%). as an example if both legs (18% x 2 = 36%) the groin (1%) and the front chest and abdomen were burned this would involve 55% of the body. only second and third degree burn areas are added together to measure total body burn area. while first degree burns are painful the skin integrity is intact and it is able to do its job with fluid and temperature maintenance. if more than15%-20% of the body is involved in a burn significant fluid may be lost. shock may occur if inadequate fluid is not provided intravenously. as the percentage of burn surface area increases the risk of death increases as well. patients with burns involving less than 20% of their body should do well but those with burns involving greater than 50% have a significant mortality risk depending upon a variety of factors including underlying medical conditions and age."	what is the significance of the amount of body area burned?

ovulation is the release of an egg - a human ovum. you cannot get pregnant if you are not ovulating and the right time of your cycle. of course you also need viable sperm usually by having sex with a partner capable of fathering a child and a uterus capable of nurturing a growing embryo.	can i get pregnant if i am not ovulating?
the father's drug habit is adversely affecting everyone including him. his drug use is not causing the colic or crying spells so the baby should be examined by the pediatrician. incidentally colic -- if this is what is causing the crying -- improves at age three months so there may be brighter days soon. the drug use is a more serious problem. it is difficult enough to care for a baby but when one parent is impaired it can be next to impossible. the three month old will most likely get better but with drug use it can only get worse; perhaps to the point where the baby no longer has a father.	if a father is taking drugs will the newborn have colicy or other problems? . the baby is 3 months old and has many bouts of crying etc. through out most every day. could the father's drug habit have affected the baby?
based on the description i am not sure why you are assuming gallbladder cancer since it is quite rare. maybe the doctor indicated that was a concern. ultrasound results are available quickly so i wouldn't let that part worry you. however unintentional weight loss is a concern and i'm glad that her doctor is getting to the bottom of what's going on. to answer your specific question gallbladder cancer is not common and fewer than 10 000 people are diagnosed with it every year (including cancers of the gallbladder bile ducts). it is usually found fairly late because it's often advanced by the time someone has significant syptoms. if it's found early which happens in about 1 in 5 people there is the possibility to cure it. but even if it can't be cured treatment can definitely help prolong life.	hi is gallbladder cancer a common disease? also is it possible to have it detected early enough to be cured? . my mother had a few episodes of vomiting over the last few weeks and also lost about 30 pounds during the last two years without really trying to do so. she had bloodwork done last week and had an ultrasound performed this tuesday. she received a call from her primary care physician yesterday (wednesday) asking her to come in so her doctor can review the results with her. i'm obviously nervous since the results were provided to her physician so quickly. is this normal turn around time?

"since you were in the navy i'm wondering if you are eligible for psychiatric services as an outpatient. you probably do need a complete evaluation including medical and then a consideration of what the next steps should be. i would think you need both outpatient therapy on a regular weekly basis some help finding appropriate financial assistance a place to live and perhaps medication. one thing that you definitely do not need is to be told you are either ""insane or crazy. "" you are not. you do need a mental health professional to advocate for you and who can help establish that you do not present a danger to anyone since you indicate that is the case. people often believe that anyone with a mental problem is dangerous and that's not so either. remember as a former service person who is now in need of help you deserve to get that help and to feel better. please see what person in the social service area can help you. if you cannot get help from anyone talk to local service person's organizations and see how they can help. very many times they do have individuals whose sole duty at the organization is to help people such as yourself get the services they need and deserve. you have served your country well and now your country owes you help."	i served in the navy and now have panic disorder. my family does not believe in mental illness. are they right?

medicines usually are the treatment of choice for ulcerative colitis. they control or prevent inflammation in the intestines and help: relieve symptoms. promote healing of damaged tissues. put the disease into remission and keep it from flaring up again. postpone or prevent the need for surgery. medication choices the choice of medicine usually depends on the severity of the disease the part of the colon affected and whether complications are present. treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis often begins with aminosalicylates (such as sulfasalazine or mesalamine). aminosalicylates relieve inflammation in the intestines and help the disease go into remission. they may also keep the disease from becoming active again. corticosteroids may be added if symptoms continue. corticosteroids relieve inflammation in the intestines. for severe cases stronger treatment with medicines that suppress the immune system (such as azathioprine [aza] 6-mercaptopurine [6-mp] or cyclosporine ) infliximab ( remicade ) and intravenous (iv) corticosteroids may be needed. if you are pregnant talk to your doctor about which medicines are safe for you to take. usually aminosalicylates and corticosteroids are safe especially when your doctor thinks that ulcerative colitis is more dangerous to the fetus than these medicines. ask your doctor whether you can take medicines that suppress the immune system. these are used only when the benefit outweighs the potential harm to the fetus. a doctor can recommend medicines based on the stage of the pregnancy and the severity of your symptoms. several studies have shown that the nicotine patch may help treat active ulcerative colitis. it is not yet known how long the benefits of the nicotine patch last or if the patch can help prevent flare-ups of ulcerative colitis. if the patch works it most likely benefits people whose symptoms began or became worse after quitting smoking. but due to the addictive power and other harmful effects of nicotine most doctors still prefer to use traditional medicines to treat ulcerative colitis before trying the nicotine patch. what to think about aminosalicylates are the most common medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis. most of the time these medicines are all a person needs to keep the disease in remission (a period of time with no symptoms). when aminosalicylates do not work corticosteroids are most often the next medicine tried. corticosteroids will only be used long enough to stop the inflammation in your colon. after the inflammation goes down aminosalicylates will most likely be used to maintain remission. if aminosalicylates are not strong enough to keep you in remission or if corticosteroids don't work your doctor may have you try different medicines. these medicines include immunomodulators cyclosporine and infliximab. all of these medicines control the immune response in your body and will decrease the amount of inflammation in your intestine. the inflammation is what causes the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat ulcerative colitis?

well that's quite interesting isn't it? the appendix is not an organ capable of growing back. in fact the appendix isn't an organ at all. it's an anatomical structure a tubelike sac that hangs off the large intestine where that structure meets the small intestine. doctors and scientists are still debating what function if any the appendix performs. so to your question. first i would ask if you're positive your appendix was removed. in other words was it taken out due to a case of appendicitis or was it removed in conjunction with another operation. sometimes for example a surgeon will remove the appendix at the same time the gallbladder or an ovary is removed. if that's the case maybe you were misinformed about whether it really was removed or not. if you're positive the appendix was removed then i'd say someone is misreading the ultrasound image. it's possible they're seeing some fleshy tissue or fatty tissue and identifying it as the appendix. hope this helps!	can the appendix grow back? . i have had my appendix removed back in 1989. i have had several scans ultrasounds over the past few years that have indicated my appendix looked good. how can that be if it was removed? is it possible it has grown back?

the amount of sleep that a child needs is going to be based on that child’s age. actually we have a great article on webmd where you can actually click on the different ages to find out what your child’s sleep need is going to be. but generally speaking what we’re finding in national sleep foundation’s polls is that kids aren’t getting enough sleep and they are also not getting sleep at the times that they need. it may be an enjoyable thing to because you’re coming home late to be able to spend some time with your child and have them stay up past their bedtime but it really can be a detriment to their health in the long run. in the first year of life children are going to sleeping north of 18 hours in some cases. maybe as little as 12 or 13 hours but that oftentimes occurs if you have a very colicky baby or a reflux baby. try to know and understand what health issues could be going on there. when you get into the 2 to 3 range that’s when your children should be sleeping about 11 – 12 hours. then when you start to move into grade school you’re going to be looking at 9 to 10 hours and you should your kids should stick to the 9 to 10 hour range almost through high school. very few high schoolers get that much sleep and so interestingly what we’ve found is first of all high school age children tend to swing and want to stay up late and sleep late and so anybody out there who has a high school age kid knows that the kids want to stay up til 2:00 am and then they want to sleep til noon. uh that’s a natural occurrence for them. believe it or not in minnesota they actually changed school start times and they found that kids increased their grades by almost a full letter grade by actually going to school later and staying later. so when you’re talking with your children about sleep one of the things that you want to say is hey this is very important for you. first of all it helps you learn second of all it helps your overall mood and finally it really helps your health. and so i try to make the importance of sleep greater for children so that way they can get an understanding of it. it’s not that mom or dad wants you to go to bed at a certain time because they are mean. it’s because they are actually doing something better for your health.	how much sleep does my child need?
one of the greatest things that i recommend for anybody is relaxation breathing. whoever thought a breathing exercise would be a terrific thing to do? it’s very simple. you learn it in less than a minute it might take you one minute to do you can do it any time during the day anywhere it will make you feel good. how do i do relaxation breathing? what i want you to do during this exercise as we are breathing in we’re going to breathe in hold a breath and breathe out through our mouths. when you do that i want you to think about the position of your shoulders the position of your ribs where your legs and hands are. i want you to think about those things. so we’re going to begin. you breathe in through your nose hold it for a count of five out through your mouth. remember you’re thinking about the position of your shoulders as they go up and down your ribs go in and out. you’re going to do that at least three times. we don’t want you hyperventilating remember it’s got to be comfortable for you. you gradually so you do it again alright nice and slow very slow. just think about the shoulders. do it 3 to 5 times. you can do it anywhere you can out to the water cooler. if anybody hears you they’ll think you’re sighing. that’s okay. you can go out the elevator go downstairs in the elevator by yourself. you can do it. you can go to the ladies’ room the men’s room wherever you want to do it. it’s so easy. you can do it at your desk. you can do it 10 times a day if that’s what you feel you need. you can’t overdo it as long as you don’t hyperventilate and that’s fine.	once i’m stressed how can i calm myself?

i would be sure to see his pediatrician and/or pediatric dermatologist. they will most likely do a culture to identify if it is truly ringworm (which is a fungal infection of the skin that appears in worm-like round patches) or if it might be simple eczema or dry skin. using hydrocortisone on a fungal infection without properly addressing the infection could cause the rash to worsen. depending on how much of the body is affected the physician might recommend topical and or oral antifungal medications to get the rash under control.	my 3 year old son has ringworm and it’s spreading. what do i put on it? how long does it take to go away?
the exact cause of gad is not fully known but a number of factors -- including genetics brain chemistry and environmental stresses -- appear to contribute to its development. genetics : some research suggests that family history plays a part in increasing the likelihood that a person will develop gad. this means that the tendency to develop gad may be passed on in families. brain chemistry : gad has been associated with abnormal levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. neurotransmitters are special chemical messengers that help move information from nerve cell to nerve cell. if the neurotransmitters are out of balance messages cannot get through the brain properly. this can alter the way the brain reacts in certain situations leading to anxiety. environmental factors : trauma and stressful events such as abuse the death of a loved one divorce changing jobs or schools may lead to gad. gad also may become worse during periods of stress. the use of and withdrawal from addictive substances including alcohol caffeine and nicotine can also worsen anxiety.	what causes generalized anxiety disorder (gad)?

my husband underwent two hernia surgeries a few years apart. he experienced different levels of pain post surgery each time. some of the pain did extend beyond 6 weeks. most surgeons will suggest your pain will last 6 weeks and expect your body to follow protocol. however each person is unique and so is their healing process as well as pain tolerance. in the case of hernia surgery specifically if you had mesh inserted you may experience both healing pain as well as pain and/or discomfort from your body assimilating the mesh. i am not a medical professional but my opinion is that if your pain is accompanied by fever you need to call your physician. also only you can determine if the level of pain you are experiencing is intolerable in which case again i would recommend a call to your doctor.	is it normal to have pain/discomfort 6 weeks after hernia operation? . i had a ingurial hernia operation on the 23 of october and i still have constant discomfort and occasional pain in the area i had surgery. the surgeons put a mesh to prevent the hernia from reoccurring and it was right above my groin. i feel something is holding me tight (in the incision area) and i cant stretch properly and i am limping because i cannot make full strides. is this normal to still have pain and discomfort along with the other problems i mentioned this long after the operation?

hi this is from site and this is the link to it <link> for more help just google the link to the www. to open and read. isoniazid may cause severe and sometimes fatal liver problems (eg hepatitis). the risk of liver problems is greater in patients older than 35 years old. it may also be increased by daily use of alcohol long-term liver problems or unsanitary injectable drug use. women especially those who are black are hispanic or have just had a baby may also be at increased risk. hepatitis can develop at any time during treatment but usually occurs during the first 3 months. your doctor will monitor your liver function and discuss your progress every month. contact your doctor right away if you develop unusual fatigue weakness or fever that lasts longer than 3 days general feeling of discomfort loss of appetite nausea vomiting numbness or tingling of the hands or feet dark urine yellowing of the skin or eyes or stomach pain or tenderness. your doctor may decide to slowly restart isoniazid after these symptoms disappear and lab tests return to normal. patients with active liver problems should not use isoniazid. your find lots more info on site this does not seem a very nice drug to be taken. good luck	does isoniazid affect the good bacteria in digestive system. what are some side effects?

your friend is misinformed. and she's doing herself and anyone around her a disservice by avoiding the flu shot. the influenza vaccine is an important tool in reducing the spread of this potentially lethal virus. when a person goes unvaccinated they're at much higher risk for picking up the virus. once they're infected they can pass the virus to others. some of the people who get the influenza virus will die. that's why it's so important to get the flu shot each year. you might reassure your friend that according to the centers for disease control (cdc) vaccines used in the united states contain only 6 or 7 ingredients. these include: aluminum salts sugars and/or gelatins egg protein penicillin sulfa drugs formaldehyde thimerosol (only in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine) those last two look scary right? but here's the thing: these ingredients are used in tiny amounts. in fact any given dose of a vaccine contains so little of those ingredients that they're not harmful to take. look at it this way: if it were harmful to get a flu shot wouldn't millions of people each year get sick and/or die from the vaccine? but they don't. in fact except for people with an egg allergy very few people have any adverse reaction to the flu shot and there certainly are no long-term studies that show getting an annual flu shot has a negative impact on one's health over the course of a lifetime. i urge you not to avoid the flu shot. it's good for your health and for the health of those around you. hope this helps!	my friend says flu shots contain toxins; she doesn't get an annual shot. i get one every year. who's crazy? . i researched the mercury in thimersol; fda is going to discontinue it but it you get a single dose shot there is no thimersol in it. some of the toxins she thinks are in flu shots are:. aluminum. mercury. triton x-100. phenol. ethylene glycol. betapropiolactone. nonoxynol. octoxinol 9. sodium phosphate
"probably not. in the first place your pediatrician would have advised you whether or not you should be concerned. obviously he or she did not. second receiving an extra immunization dose isn't really considered a health hazard. your baby probably will exhibit the usual symptoms of having been vaccinated: irritability possibly an elevated temperature temporarily. but these symptoms should pass within a couple of days as normal. the varicella vaccine is not a ""live"" vaccine meaning it does not contain a live virus that can infect your baby. the only likely side effect of receiving a double dose is that it will rev up your baby's immune system a little more vigorously. if your baby has any abnormal symptoms after the weekend give your pediatrician a call for peace of mind. but i don't think you'll have anything to worry about. hope this helps!"	dr accidentally gave our 12 mo old a double dose of varicella. should we be concerned?

hi try this if you got your period today you're not pregnant. sore nipples arise when oestrogen becomes dominant in your system. your body released more oestrogen because you were going to have your period in two weeks. in order to have a period your body release another hormone progesterone which simultaneously starts the flow and stops any fertilization of remaining egg follicles. you could have sore nipples all through your period this time. oestrogen can make you nauseated. you are not pregnant. you just need to learn more about the process your body goes through preparing for menstruation. something may have stimulated the excess oestrogen in your system. it could be just your body changing or even food containing animal oestrogen. hope this helps your problem in some way. good luck	sore nipples not pregnant. my nipples have been sore for a month now. i'm not pregnant. what can i do to stop the pain? they are very tender to touch and when i take my bra off they hurt really bad and its not that time of the month yet.
doctors do not know why certain hair follicles are programmed to have a shorter growth period than others. although a person's level of androgens -- male hormones normally produced by both men and women -- is believed to be a factor hair loss has nothing to do with virility. an individual's genes however -- from both male and female parents -- unquestionably influence that person's predisposition to male or female pattern baldness. telogen effluvium is temporary hair loss that can occur within a few months after a high fever a severe illness or extreme stress and in women following childbirth. drugs that can cause temporary hair loss include chemotherapy drugs used in cancer treatment blood thinners retinoids used to treat acne and other skin problems beta-adrenergic blockers used to control blood pressure and birth control pills. hair loss can also be caused by burns x-rays and scalp injuries. in such cases normal hair growth usually returns once the cause is eliminated. ringworm caused by a fungal infection can also cause hair loss. the causes of alopecia areata a disease that often strikes children or teenagers remain unexplained. it is thought to be an autoimmune disease meaning that the immune system revs up for unknown reasons and affects the hair follicles. in most cases the hair grows back although it may be very fine and possibly a different color before normal coloration and thickness return. although shampooing too often perms bleaching and dyeing hair do not cause baldness they can contribute to overall thinning by making hair weak and brittle. tight braiding and using rollers or hot curlers can damage and break hair and running hair picks through tight curls can scar hair follicles. in most instances hair grows back normally if the source of the problem is removed but severe damage to the hair or scalp sometimes causes permanent bald patches.	what causes hair loss?

it sounds as though you are taking very good steps to prevent osteoporosis. exercise has a wide variety of beneficial health effects. however exercise does not bring about substantial increases in bone density. the benefit of exercise for osteoporosis has mostly to do with decreasing the risk of falls probably because balance is improved and/or muscle strength is increased. research has not yet determined what type of exercise is best for osteoporosis or for how long. until research has answered these questions most doctors recommend weight-bearing exercise such as walking preferably daily. you are also right in not smoking. smoking cigarettes decreases estrogen levels and can lead to bone loss in women before menopause. smoking cigarettes can also lead to earlier menopause. in regard to calcium it is recommended that premenopausal women take 1 000 mg of calcium in their diet each day. unfortunately surveys have shown that average women in the united states are consuming less than 500 mg of calcium per day in their diet less than the recommended amounts. additional calcium can be obtained by drinking more milk and consuming more yogurt cottage cheese and calcium-fortified foods such as orange juice or by taking calcium supplement tablets. before taking calcium supplements check with your doctor. calcium supplements are generally avoided if one has had kidney stones. an adequate calcium intake and adequate body stores of vitamin d are important foundations for maintaining bone density and strength. vitamin d helps the absorption of calcium from the intestines. vitamin d comes from the diet and the skin. vitamin d production by the skin is dependent on exposure to sunlight. active people living in sunny regions (southern california hawaii countries around the equator etc. ) can produce most of the vitamin d they need from their skin. conversely lack of exposure to sunlight due to residence in northern latitudes or physical incapacitation causes vitamin d deficiency. in less temperate regions such as minnesota michigan and new york skin production of vitamin d is markedly diminished in the winter months especially among the elderly. in that population dietary vitamin d becomes important. when a women becomes menopausal estrogen supplementation is considered. menopausal hormone therapy (previously referred to as hormone replacement therapy or hrt) has been shown to prevent bone loss increase bone density and prevent bone fractures. it is useful in preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.	besides not smoking exercising and eating a calcium-rich diet what else can i do to lower my risk of osteoporosis?
in addition to what the other contributor said it's possible that you are pregnant and the hormone is not yet strong enough to show up on the test. i went through the same thing when i was pregnant with my second child. the hcg hormone wasn't strong enough to show up until i was already 4 or 5 weeks late. another thing to consider is is you have always been irregular then pcos is a possibility too. if i were you i'd consult with an ob/gyn soon. at least that way you can get some real answers and maybe some stress relief.	is there any way i can still be pregnant? . i was supposed to get my period on the 20th but i missed it so i took a pregnancy later that night. it came out negative and the following day i took one during the afternoon and it also came out negative. yesterday morning i also took when and it was negative too. ever since i've been having sex my period has been irregular and now i'm nervous if there is any way for me to be pregnant still after 3 negative pregnancy tests or could there be another reason why im missing my period?

it is 3 a. m. and you have a baby. and we all know what is going on: it’s feeding time it’s changing time or it is simply time to say “hi everyone! i am up and excited to be here! ” but you have a presentation at work the next day carpool in the morning and this is night number 10 in a row so what does a sleep-deprived parent do? a new study has told us exactly what may be happening and no big surprises here: mom gets up more than dad! a university of michigan researcher (having reviewed 20 000 working parents from 2003-2007) has given us the “first known nationally representative data documenting substantial gender differences in getting up at night -- mainly for babies and small children. ” not only do women get up more than men (working women are 2½ times more likely to get up than working dads: 32% of women compared to 11% of men) but: * women stay up for an average of 44 minutes as compared to 30 minutes for men. * the difference is maintained even with many other variables taken into account such as: employment status income education levels. * sole bread-winner moms seem to have it even worse: 28% of sole-provider working moms have interrupted sleep compared to only 4 % of sole-provider working dads! the good news is that according to this study this difference and the actual interruptions decline with the age of the child. as the child gets older (ages 3-5) the difference is less just 3% for working moms and 1% for working dads. my suggestion for any parents with a newborn: 1. consult with your pediatrician to make sure that there is no emergent physical reason for these awakenings (e. g. colic or reflux). 2. consider an “on-call” rotation similar to other professions for example: * mom takes monday wednesday and friday nights. * dad takes tuesday thursday and saturday nights. * and you rotate every other sunday. 3. look at your internal biological clock and see what may work better: * is one parent a night owl and the other an “early to bed – early to rise” person? * split the night in half and each take a shift! and a special note to all the moms who have dads who help out in the middle of the night (but you probably already know this): he’s a keeper!	who gets up more often with the baby -- moms or dads?

late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to develop and are usually permanent. but keep in mind that the possibility of a late side effect does not mean you will have one. late side effects result from damage done to your body that can cause problems later. for example scar tissue resulting from radiation can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. bladder bowel and sexual problems can develop after radiation to the abdomen/pelvis area. another possible late side effect is the development of a second cancer. radiation has long been recognized as a cancer-causing agent. and research has shown that although rare some people develop another cancer years after radiation therapy has cured the first cancer. it's important to talk with your doctor about the potential risk and to weigh it against the benefits to be derived from radiation therapy as a treatment option.	what are the late side effects from radiation therapy?

most helpful answer i guess my first question would be why you're trying to stop taking the effexor (generic name venlafaxine). generally this medication is prescribed for depression or different types of anxiety disorders. do you feel your condition has improved and you no longer need the medication for it? do you feel taking the medication is causing intolerable side effects? no matter why you want to stop taking venlafaxine please talk to your health care provider. if the medication is causing side effects your medical provider may be able to switch you to a different medication. if you feel your mental health condition is under control at this point so you no longer need medication for it your health care provider can advise you about how to safely stop taking this medication. venlafaxine (effexor) is not a medication that should be stopped suddenly. as you've learned this approach can produce bad side effects. in particular if you have stopped taking velafaxine and are experiencing feelings or thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself or hurting other people you should seek immediately medical attention by calling 911. i wish you the very best!	trying to stop effexor but can't. debilitating withdrawal symptoms won't go away. what can i do?

"starting by 2014 businesses that employ 100 or fewer workers will be able to buy insurance through an insurance marketplace or exchange. according to the congressional budget office the insurance small businesses buy through an exchange ""would have lower administrative costs on average than the policies those firms would buy under current law particularly for very small firms. "" also keep in mind that if you run a small business that employs fewer than 25 workers earning less than $50 000 a year and you pay for at least half of your employees' health insurance costs you may qualify for a tax credit of up to 35%. starting in 2014 those credits increase to 50%."	will small business employers be required to provide health insurance or can they force employees to go buy their own?

mammography is an x-ray examination of the breast that has the ability to detect a cancer in the breast when it is quite small long before it may be felt by breast examination. approximately 85%-90% of all breast cancers are detectable by mammography. early detection by mammography has reduced the mortality rate from breast cancer by 20%-30% in women over 50 years of age. however some 10%-15% of breast cancers are not visible on mammography but can be felt on physical examination of the breast. therefore a normal mammogram does not exclude the possibility of breast cancer. breast examination by your health-care professional by palpation and visual inspection is also important. during a routine physical checkup a doctor can conduct an examination of the breast.	what are the advantages and limitations of mammography?

with poison ivy poison oak and poison sumac the sap in the leaves stems and roots of these plants contain an oil called urushiol (pronounced yoo-roo-shee-all). many people have an allergic reaction when urushiol touches the skin which produces the rash. you may be caught by surprise thinking you haven't touched any of these poisonous plants -- thinking only of the leaves -- but you may have unwittingly come in contact with their roots or stems. urushiol quickly penetrates the skin often leaving red lines that show where you brushed against the plant. from 12 to 72 hours later symptoms appear. scratching the itchy rash doesn't cause it to spread but can prolong skin healing and cause a secondary infection. the rash isn't contagious so you won't spread it to others by going to school or work. three types of transmission can occur: direct contact when you touch or brush your skin directly against the plant. indirect contact when you touch pets gardening tools sports equipment or other objects that had direct contact with the plant. airborne contact from burning these plants which releases particles of urushiol into the air that can penetrate your skin eyes nose throat or respiratory system.	what causes the rashes from poison ivy oak and sumac?
i'm so sorry you're going through this. back pain isn't fun and it's nothing to fool around with. when a marine (or former marine) tell me he has barely controlled back pain this tells me he needs to see a doctor. many back conditions could cause the symptoms you're describing from a displaced disk to a cracked vertebra. the only way to find out for sure what's going on is to get a physical examination and some testing (like x-rays or mri) done. back problems rarely get better on their own so the sooner you get this treated the better. i wish you all the best with this!	continuous back pain. when i was a teen i hurt my back in football when two lineman came down on me and crushed my spine (seemingly) the pain went away after that. i joined the marine corps constanty 20 mile hikes with up to 100 pounds of gear. sometimes we'd do ranges where you'd lay down in the prone to shoot and then get up and run. when i got up i could barely manage the pain. i had to grit my teeth because my lower back hurt so bad. like to pieces of bone were grinding into each other. hump on back.

during pregnancy it's important for a woman to get enough calcium for herself as well as her growing baby. most studies show that while some bone loss may occur during pregnancy a woman usually regains it after giving birth. in fact studies show that having children even as many as 10 does not increase a woman's chance of getting osteoporosis later in life. for women who have pregnancies in their teens the effects on bone health later in life are still not certain. teens have not yet reached peak bone mass. more studies are needed to learn if teen pregnancies can affect future bone health. some women develop a temporary type of osteoporosis during pregnancy. while we do not fully understand what causes this type of osteoporosis it is extremely rare and usually goes away shortly after a woman gives birth. breastfeeding for the recommended 6-12 months has many health benefits for mother and baby. like pregnancy breastfeeding may cause some temporary bone loss. however bone density appears to recover over time and should not cause long-term harm to a woman's bone health.	what happens to your bones during pregnancy and breastfeeding?

often i am posed with questions about the significance of the sun protection factor (spf) number. there is an assumption that the higher the spf number the more protected you'll be from the sun. but you need not seek the highest spf available because beyond an spf of 30 you will be getting little additional protection. the american academy of dermatology recommends using sunscreen that has an spf of 30 or greater that protects against uva and uvb rays and that's water resistant. it is important to know that uvb rays are those that cause bad sunburns and are associated with skin cancer. uva rays tend to be the culprit for skin aging but can also influence the development of skin cancer just not as ambitiously. therefore i recommend using a product that protects against both uvb and uva rays. it's important to know what happens to your sunscreen when you get in the water. water will dilute sunscreen so you'll need to reapply it reasonably often. the recommendation is that a water resistant sunscreen be reapplied after 40 minutes spent in a swimming pool or the ocean. sunscreens that claim to be waterproof tend to be a little heavier and more oily and should keep you protected for up to 80 minutes. the difference between sunscreen and sun block is that sunscreen protects your skin by absorbing and reflecting uv rays. sun block reflects and scatters uvb rays and creates a barrier between your skin and the sun. remember that the sun allows the body to perform a self-conversion for vitamin d which is essential for the calcium metabolism that impacts the strength of your bones. vitamin d is very important and in fact may be critical in the prevention of certain cancers.	what do i need to know about sunscreens and sun blocks?

i wish there was an easy diet answer for ibs sufferers but you are going to have to do some investigative work to find what and how much of certain foods you have trouble tolerating. that being said most people with ibs have problems with greasy foods spicy foods caffeine-containing beverages (coffee and tea) and alcohol. certain foods can increase gastrointestinal discomfort when eaten in large amounts such as beans cabbage cauliflower peas and brussels sprouts. most ibs sufferers do better with smaller frequent meals (5-6 times daily) instead of big meals less frequently (2-3 big meals). i recommend you see registered dietitian (rd) that performs elimination diets such as fodmaps (fermentable oligo- di- and monosaccharides and polyols). he or she will help you identify if you are sensitive to certain carbohydrates in foods making your symtpoms worse. an rd can not only help you choose a diet that is tolerated but one that meets your nutritional needs. to find a dietitian new you go to eatright. org. this article provides more information on finding the right diet for ibs <link> good luck!	diagnosed with ibs that goes back and forth between diarrhea and constipation what should i eat and not eat?

you bet that is good. very good as long your systolic pressure is not consistently above 140 and your diastolic pressure remains in the mid-80 range. an occasional elevated systolic during stress or activity is expected. blood pressures vary throughout the day so take your bp at different times different arms and in different positions once in a while (sitting standing or supine) and notice how they tend to change a bit.	my systolic pressure ranges mid 120s to mid 140s and my diastolic ranges lower 50s to mid 60s. is this normal or okay?
this is an interesting question and i'm glad you asked it. in order to develop an allergy to a substance you have to be exposed to it. in other words it's extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure. (it's not impossible but it's fairly rare. ) one good example is penicillin. millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects. many of those people today have penicillin allergies. that early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on. that could be what happened to you too. if a physician confirmed your allergy you need to take it to heart. allergies not only can come on later in life they can get worse over time. so that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually. you also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots. i'd suggest you talk with your health care provider to see if this restriction applies to you. sorry you're going through this. it's difficult to give up a well-loved food.	i always ate eggs and now i have a diagnosed allergy. how does this happen? . i am 69 and about 4 years ago i began getting very sick after eating eggs. severe cramps and very bad diarrea after only 10 minutes or so. i just had a blood test and it shows i do have an allergy to eggs. how can this happen after a lifetime of enjoying eggs. i really miss soft boiled eggs. is there a trigger for this type of allergy? i don't understand how this can happen. any ideas? . thank you
in the manic phase the person can tend to act impulsively/partake in unpremeditated risky behavior that they normally would not so therefore its possible that cheating and stealing are something that occur when she is in the manic swing of it. but it is no excuse to lie/cheat/steal. there are some people who are bipolar but would never cheat or steal but they would drive their car recklessly etc. call her doctor and express the things that are going on i am sure he/she would be a good help. bipolar disorder is about moods. lying cheating stealing is about their character. she has probably done it for so long that her bi polar disorder is a good excuse to get her out of tough situations like this one.	my aunt steals pain killers and she is bipolar. does bipolar cause her to steal? . she is in her mid to late fourties. she claims she dosent steal pain killers but we have all seen her do it. now her sister claims that she steals the pain killers due to her being bipolar. i am wondering if this is in fact true or that her sister is just denying it to herself. which in turn is not able to get her the help she needs.

moving on from a relationship is extremely difficult especially when you still love the person. while keeping yourself busy and time are very helpful in moving on they are not the only things you need to do. you must find things that you can invest yourself in-- find things that matter to you. without this the keeping busy will only provide very temporary relief. . in talking yourself through this imagine that the old you is a friend. think about what you were going through at the time and bring back how it all felt. then talk to that old you as you would talk to a friend. give her understanding. cry with her. let her know that she is more than her actions at that time that you can understand why she acted as she did and that she is still a good person and lovable. -- that is how you would feel toward and respond to a friend right? this will take time to work through. but with effort persistence and a caring feeling toward yourself you can slowly help yourself heal. if all of this feels too hard to do and you don't have a trusted friend who can help you through this then you might consider finding a therapist to help. .	what are some suggestions for moving on after a relationship ends?

thank you for your answers. i know i had an ultra sound done last year and it showed a couple cysts but they said they were big enough to cause any problems so maybe thats what it is and a new one has shown up or an existing one has gotten worse maybe? yea ovulation could be a possibility too. i never thought about that but it would be hard to track my cycle to see because i have the mirena. sometimes i have a menstrual cycle and sometimes i go without one for months.	what can cause a dull menstrual like cramp pain on right side of pelvic area? . for the past 3 to 4 days i have been having a menstrual cramp like pain but it is only on the right side. it is not a severe pain but enough of pain that after 4 days it has worn me down and made it hard to do anything. i have taken perscription ibprofen i had left from my gallbladder surgery and it doesnt seem to help. if i put a heat pack on the area it helps but as soon as i get up and move around its right back to hurting again. im absolutley miserable. what can cause this?
well they actually would all probably help; but there’s a few other things that we need to know here. does the patient want to have something that’s gonna cause ‘em drowsiness or something that’s not gonna make them tire. the other question i have is are they actually living with the pet? you know it’s one of those things that they might go over to a house once in a while occasionally where there are pets there that they have this allergic reaction to and in that case there’s different choices based on that medication. for something quick zyrtec or -- over-the-counter is a great choice. it will cause a little bit of tiredness; but it does work usually within 30 minutes. claritin is a non-drowsy one but sometimes you have to take it for a few days before it’ll make you feel better. but once again we just need a little bit more information. but if the patient can go to their pharmacist and ask them and tell them “yes i live with the cat year-round” and things like that we can help them in the right direction as far as what product over the counter may be a good choice or refer them to the proper healthcare professional.	i have cat allergies and wanted to know which over-the-counter and prescription medications might help.
"in my personal experience ""yes"". i tapered down dosage from twice to once a day for two weeks. then only once a day every other day for two weeks. finally once a day every three days for one week. because i have to go off and back on the medication every six months this is the only way that prevents that ""tingly"" sensation if i just stop completely."	when stopping gabapentin is it necessary to taper off? . i have been taking 900 mg 3 times a day. i got a steroid injection and now pain seems to be gone. can i just stop the gabapentin or do i need to taper off? if so what is the best way to do that?
"i think it would be helpful to understand exactly what anemia is. anemia is the medical term for the inability of red blood cells to transport oxygen molecules to the tissues of the body. anemia can be caused by either a lack of red blood cells (such as from excessive bleeding) or from a lack of hemoglobin (a protein on red blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen). when a person has anemia their organs muscles nerves and other tissues are not receiving enough oxygen to function well. usually a person with anemia feels very ""run down. "" many people experience episodes of mild to moderate anemia due to temporary situations like heavy menstrual bleeding. because this type of anemia is caused by some sort of brief episode that brings about the condition the body often can rebound by producing additional red blood cells to correct the problem. sometimes however anemia is caused by a long-term medical condition that doesn't allow the body to ""catch up"" its red blood cell production. an example of this type of anemia is sickle cell anemia. this inherited disorder causes many red blood cells to be malformed and unable to transport oxygen. this is not a situation the body can correct by making more cells. so to answer your question untreated anemia can have a serious impact on a person's health depending on the cause. if a person has a chronic anemia they could actually die from the disease. and that would be a shame because most anemias can be managed with medications and supplements. if you have anemia or know someone you think may have it i suggest you visit a health care practitioner for a simple blood test and treatment. wishing you well!"	what happens when you don't treat anemia?
thanks for your question! what you're describing certainly could be part of the start of menopause. because of your age that would be my first thought especially if you're also experiencing hot flashes (flushes) night sweats or the need to urinate (pee) more often. your best bet would be to make a trip to see your gynecologist. if in fact you are entering menopause your medical provider will be able to tell you what to expect over the next few years and can discuss related issues such as hormone replacement therapy and bone health. so call and make an appointment to get checked out. i wish you all the best! this sounds like me i am 55 yrs old and still am having periods not sure when my periods will stop if this your normal periods are like every month maybe not there is a test the dr can give to determine if you are starting menopause or peri menopause	i am 51 years old. my periods are heavey and bright red is this part of menopause?

based on what you witnessed there definitely could be an improvement of hygiene practices. i have no idea if your grandfather was exposed to any pathogen but breaches in hygiene are high on the list of infections. many times hands are washed frequently usually after and/or before each patient and new fresh gloves are used for each patient. patient or their families may not witness the handwashing if it occurred in another room or out in the hall but a change of gloves between patients is mandatory.	the phlebotomist didn't wash her hands before seeing my grandfather. see details. the lady saw other people and handeled a cup of urine before seeing my grandfather. he has type 2 diabetes alzheimers and dementia. he's 90 years old. she touched his arm to get a vein then wiped it with what i believe was alcohol or an alcohol wipe. then she stuck him placed gauze over the wound and had him hold the gauze after she touched it. we went out to eat after and he ate toast by hand. i didn't see any blood or urine on the gloves could have spread cmv hiv hep a b or c this way?
"honestly the only way to diagnose strep is through a lab test. even if all the signs (like throat redness) and symptoms (like soreness) are there it still may not be strep. even ""white spots"" in the back of the mouth are no guarantee it's a case of strep. strep throat is almost always accompanied by fever. are you using a thermometer to measure your son's temperature or are you relying on the old hand-to-the-forehead method? it's very important to use a thermometer when assessing fever. i mention this because it never ceases to amaze me how many people do not have this basic tool in their medicine cabinets. keep in mind also if you're giving your son acetaminophen (tylenol) to ease the pain of the sore throat this could cause him to register a ""normal"" temperature on the thermometer (because acetaminophen is a fever-reducer). instead of speculating about what might be going on with your son i suggest you take him to his pediatrician. since the problem has been going on for nearly a week it's not a bad idea to get medical attention. i hope your little boy feels better soon! wishing you well!"	my 7 yr old son has a sore throat. red in the back and he screams when i touch side of neck. strep? . i cant see the hanging ball well to see if there is white spots. this sore throat has been going on for 4-5 days now. he has no fever complains of stomach aches feels like vomiting and vomited once in these days.
"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. sometimes pregnancy can stretch the abdominal muscles out so much that they can't ""snap back.

no i don't think that your pregnant. i say this because of all the negative test feedback. however i do think that you should see a doctor if you are having such heavy discharge. you could have a number of things going on such as a yeast infection ( which you could try over the counter testing for to determ if that's possibly what it is. they also sell treatment for yeast infections as well. ) you could also have some type of std ( i know that's not what you want to hear. ) i know its not a 100% answer but better to be safe than sorry. if you don't have insurance you can try the free clinic most county's have them. depending on your income you only have to pay a minimum fee or in most cases nothing at all.	if you miss your period how long after will it show positive on test if you r pregnant? how long should u wait to take1. i had a 3day period last month plus it was late. this month i haven't had 1 at all! i am supposed to start my period the 2nd week of the month and i took a pregnancy test and it says negative. i just wanted some advice if i am taking the test to early or if it could be something else because i have had this problem once before but never have had a period only last 3days. i am bloated like and have a lot of discharge. i have took over 8 test within the last month. any advice or help please?

yes you can definitely get out breaks on your mouth but only if you already have one while preforming oral sex. as long as neither of you have an out break at the time oral sex and anything else your into is fine. its the outbreaks that cause the damage so when you have an outbreak mouth or otherwise just abstain from oral sex until the sores are gone. that's my opinion my dad has herpes and that's how he explained it to me.	i have genital herpes can i get sore on my mouth. i and my partner have genital herpes and are wondering if we are still at risk of getting out breaks on our mouths? she has had one outbreak and hasn't had another in close to a year. i just recently had my first outbreak so we are abstaining from sex until two weeks after my outbreaks goes away. what we really want to know is can we perform oral sex on each other when we are both outbreak free? we have been anecdotally told once you have it you are immune to spreading it.
while it is best to keep augmentin refrigerated at all times to maintain efficacy i am uncertain as to whether or not the efficacy was compromised because it was left out of the refrigerator all night. it does not become dangerous to use after it has been left out of the refrigerator. but it may not work to cure your son's infection and could prolong his illness. to be on the safe side i would suggest getting a new prescription. without knowing anything else about your son's situation i would say that is the way to ensure he continues to get the most effective form of the medication.	the doctor prescribed augmentin es for my son’s ear infection & cough. it was left unrefrigerated at night. is it safe?

"a sinus infection occurs when a pathogenic organism (virus bacterium or a fungus) grows within a sinus and causes intermittent blockage of the sinus ostium. drainage of mucus and pus often occur when the blockage is relieved. the drainage usually goes from the nasal passages to the throat or out the nostrils. such infections also cause inflammation (an influx of immune cells and swelling of the sinus tissue) of one or more sinuses. this adds to blocking the openings of the sinuses and causes discomfort. inflammation of the air cavities within the passages of the nose (paranasal sinuses) is referred to as sinusitis. sinusitis can be caused by infection but can also be caused by allergy and irritation of the sinuses. sinusitis is one of the more common conditions that can afflict people throughout their lives. sinusitis commonly occurs when environmental pollens irritate the nasal passages such as with hay fever. sinusitis can also result from irritants such as chemicals or the use and/or abuse of over-the-counter (otc) nasal sprays and illegal substances that may be snorted through the nose. about 30 million adults have ""sinusitis.

i happened to be in the same boat as you except i now know for sure i have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrist's range of motion. i fractured my wrist twice. first time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago. although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture. it only took one year for my wrist to develope arthritis to the extend that the only solution now is fusion withtitanium. i have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to catlidge soon develope arthritis. in your case i think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where joint/cartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps muli-range function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to arthritis due trauma. physical therapy is very important after the bone heals. age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of arthritis is less. what triggers arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set. do get second and third openion from expert surgeons. good luck	how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot. i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems. i've been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot. what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis? can it develop that fast? i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away. thank you.
"tubal ligation is a sterilization procedure that renders you unable to get pregnant. in tubal ligation the fallopian tubes are cut or blocked which makes it impossible for a sperm to reach an egg or for an egg to reach the uterus. since you had a tubal ligation procedure it's not likely you're pregnant. that said you should call your health care provider's office before the novasure procedure to let them know your period is late. they will be able to advise you regarding what steps to take (such as whether or not they want you to take a pregnancy test). on a broader note i wanted to say i hope you did not discontinue your medications without the supervision of a health care provider. conditions like high blood pressure often don't clear up on their own. if you still have blood pressure or depression issues you would be well-advised to obtain medical treatment to ensure your health and well-being. best of luck to you! i had my tubal ligation almost 16 years ago. i am currently 25 weeks pregnant. believe me i was stunned! but the doctors said that it can happen and i am evidence of that. our daughter destiny grace will be joining us around august 27th and although there are some health concerns considering that i'm a 3 time cancer survivor and about to turn 40 we are expecting a healthy baby girl. it was not an tubal pregnancy she made it directly into the womb and has been there from the start! i have a friend and she had her tube tied for 17yrs. she got pregnant and couldn't belive it. neither could i her tube came untied. so yes you could be pregnant. you could be going through mood swing and hot flases and still be pregnant. no one do not know your body who are they to judge only god and mother nature know best. good luck! it is possible to get pregnant after a tubal ligation. especially if you had the tl during a c-section. the fail rate for a tubal ligation is around 1 percent but goes up after ten years or if you had the tl during a c-section. sometimes the tubes reattach themselves or a fistula forms. although tubal pregnancy rates are higher if you had a tl than if you didn't have the ligation it is not ""more likely"" that you will have a tubal pregnancy than a successful one. if you are pregnant it would not ""most likely be ectopic. "" it's simply more likely than if you had not had a tubal ligation but the odds are still in your favor. i believe the chances of a woman without a tubal ligation has a 1 in 400 chance of an ectopic pregnancy but now you might have a 1 in 100 chance. so the odds are still quite in your favor but technically you're ""4 times more likely than you were before"" the tubal ligation. make sense? if you had clips put on your fallopian tubes they can fall off. and ties can break. but it's rare. my guess is you are either entering menopause which is not a linear process for most of us. we stop our periods they come again and get off and on until finally they don't return. or your body is reacting to the medication changes. our bodies are more sensitive than we realize. when we moved and i was about 40 my body stopped having periods for nearly 7 months. then they suddenly resumed and never missed one since. now i'm 52 and i'm still having my periods regularly. if i were you i'd let myself wonder about pregnancy. but i'd think it's probably the third most likely possibility. (and an ectopic pregnancy will be looked at quickly. ) still missing that many months of your period if you are not having mood swings or hot flashes would get me to call my doctor just to check things out. good luck!"	i am 45 had tubal ligation 15 years ago and am 2 months late could i be pregnant? . my mother did not go in to menopause until her 60s. i have been under a lot of stress for the past two years. stopped taking all medication about 6 months ago (hbp antidepressant antipsychotic and one for headaches). my periods are irregular only in that they are heavy and painful and a few days off. (not weeks or months). i am scheduled for novasure procedure next week. if i am pregnant it would most likely be ectopic right?

while healthy children and adults can be effectively treated for thrush the symptoms may be more severe and difficult to manage in those with weakened immune systems. antifungal medications which are generally taken for 10 to 14 days are often prescribed to treat thrush. these medicines are available in tablets lozenges or liquids. your dentist will have a specific treatment approach designed for you based on your age and the cause of the infection. because the presence of candida infection can be a symptom of other medical problems your dentist may suggest you seek care from a medical doctor as well so that any underlying health problems you may have can be treated.	how is thrush treated?

a fracture of the spine whether from osteoporosis trauma or cancer is basically a broken bone. the usual treatment for a broken bone is to stabilize it. a broken vertebral body can be stabilized either by a percutaneous (through the skin) procedure such as a vertebroplasty kyphoplasty or by open surgical procedures. an older technique now rarely used is to remove or sever the nerves supplying the bone; these nerves are called the gray rami communicans. finally various medications for pain can be used. these would include the full range of pain medications including over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen aspirin and the various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and various prescription medications including hydrocodone morphine preparations and the fentanyl patch.	what treatment options are there for fracture of the spine due to osteoporosis besides morphine patches?

a high thyroglobin antibody level in and of itself does not mean you have thyroid disease. they are found in nearly 20% of all women. however high levels of thyroglobulin antibodies associated with other thyroid antibodies are found in 80 to 90% of people with immune mediated inflammation of the thyroid (hashimoto’s thyroiditis). this is the most common type of thyroid hormone deficiency in the u. s. thyroglobulin antibodies are also found in pregnant women relatives of patients with hashimoto’s thyroiditis and in people with other immune mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes. the usual course of hashimoto's thyroiditis is gradual loss of thyroid function. antibodies to thyroglobulin are considered to occur as a result of damage to the thyroid from special white blood cells (t cells). common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue being cold all the time weight gain constipation dry skin and menstrual irregularities. since these symptoms occur in other diseases it is important not to always blame thyroid deficiency as the cause. fortunately laboratory tests for thyroid function make this diagnosis relatively easy. however because loss of thyroid hormone develops over time and antibodies can herald problems you will want to follow-up with your doctor about your thyroid tests and your symptoms.	what does it mean if your thyroglobin ab are very high but all the others are normal? and how does that affect the body? . i am wondering if the thyroglobin ab being high could correlate to the weight gain(15+ lbs a month and can't lose it) breast enlargement(2 cup sizes) fatigue and lack of menstration. i have been tested for cancer(negative) and i have no family history of these issues. from the research i have done i cannot find an answer so i am hoping that someone could enlighten me so i would have a stepping stone the next time i went to the doctor about this.

fluoxetine (tablet flunil 20) belongs to the ssri (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) class of antidepressants. fluoxetine is one of the notorious antidepressants in relation to sexual side effects. the available data indicate that about 30-40% of those taking fluoxetine develop some sexual side effects. in regard to reversal of side effects it is said that once you stop the drug the side effects recover almost completely. there is no need to worry if you are recovering from the ailment for which flunil was prescribed. but if you do not see any improvement even after four weeks of treatment then it is advisable to stop flunil and use some better alternative. you can consult a psychiatrist online for safer alternatives. ---> <link>	Dear Doctor,I am a 35 year old male.Recently I consulted a psychiatrist  for a health issue and the doctor prescribed tablet Flunil 20, an antidepressant.After about 2–3 weeks, I noticed that I was becoming more and more asexual.

this sounds just exactly like an issue that i dealt with for months in 2014. hubby and i went on vacation and on the last couple of days i was having an itch right at my waist line in the back. it wasn't too bad and i didn't think too much of it at the time. it would come and go. the day we got home it got worse. i looked in the mirror and there was a couple of spots each about the size of a quarter that looked like hives. i put an ice pack on it to relieve the itching and after half an hour or so it went away. over the course of about 2 months my nutritionist and i tried and tried to figure it out but it would just come and go several times a day. sometimes on my arms other times it was on my stomach or legs or back. very random. at times it would be circular in shape. other times it would show up as long lines or irregular shapes. definitely looked like hives though. then suddenly it just stopped. i realized one day that it had been a week and no new out breaks. it started on our vacation in august 2014 and ended sometime around november/december 2014. then just this past week it happened again. i noticed my arm pits itching a little one evening but again didn't think much of it. wasn't too bad just a little annoyance a couple times. the next morning i woke up to bright red pits and the same hive looking spots on my stomach. i started thinking about what was different during the time that i didn't have the hives. the only thing i could come up with was the while on our vacation last year we had lots of specialty coffee drinks from a famous coffee shop that i won't name here. i continued to have them several times a week until sometime in the fall don't remember when. just last weekend we decided to have them again a couple times that weekend. large ones. two days later the hives were back. that makes me sad but i guess maybe i need to lay off the expensive coffee drinks and just have my coffee here at home. it can be different things for different people but thought i would mention this just in case it might help someone else. i never thought at the time that my coffee drinks could be the problem (and it may just be a coincidence) but for now i think i'll avoid them.	i have a itchy rash that comes and goes what could be causing this? . the rash appears in different areas of my body for an example a rash showed up on my wrist and stayed a while and went away. later the same day it appeared on my stomach and then on my thighs etc. its itchy while it is present. at one point my hands first turned red and then start to itch really bad to the point i had to wash my hands repeatedly. i work in the medical field so i wash my hands a million times a day. what could be causing this reaction?

there is no stronger over-the-counter medication for headache or migraine pain relief. headaches are very individualized. there are several over-the-counter medications you can use to alleviate painful headaches. these medications include acetaminophen (tylenol) an effective over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) medication. this medication can help with achy pain stiffness and fever. however it does not have any anti-inflammatory properties. this is important for some types of headache relief. in addition the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug class (nsaids) consists of products like ibuprofen (motrin advil) and naproxen (naprosyn aleve) which work by exhibiting analgesic relief antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. lastly combination products such as excedrin migraine contain acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. these ingredients combined make a more powerful headache/pain reliever than the ingredients separated out alone. it is important to follow the instructions on the label of over the counter medication and not to mix products in order to prevent overdosing or toxicity. monitor the frequency and intensity of your migraines to know when it is time to seek professional help and possibly the addition of a prescription medication. if you're 18 or older advil migrane and excedrin migrane are really good. i don't know about all around pain relievers. advile migrane is a gel so it is easy to swallow and fast-acting it also lasts all day. excedrin migrane is supposedly the safest and #1 nuerologist reccomended migrane medicine. also if you're not talking about a migrane just a really bad headache please don't take these because these are really strong drugs and can hurt you if they are in your system fro no reason.	what is the strongest over-the-counter headache/pain reliever medicine?

"well in general this is a quite common surgery with a good success rate. this surgery usually is performed to decompress spinal nerves that are being pinched by collapsed discs in the upper spine. decompressing these nerves relieves pain and can increase range of motion in the neck. that said each individual person heals differently. smoking can greatly decrease the body's ability to heal tissue well so you can help yourself by quitting smoking at least a month before the surgery. consult your surgeon before implementing any of the following suggestions but i always suggested surgical patients take some extra vitamin c and eat a little extra protein in the weeks leading up to a procedure. unless you've been prescribed vitamin e (which is rare) you can discontinue it before surgery (it is a ""blood thinner "" which means your blood may not clot well during/after surgery). you also can discontinue most herbs or supplements. in general i advised surgical patients not to take anything that wasn't prescribed by their doctor in the weeks heading up to surgery. your surgeon will have specific guidelines for you to follow though and you should abide by them. if you don't understand what your surgery entails or why it's being done (or what the success rate is) then you should have another consult with the surgeon. it's his or her job to make sure you fully understand exactly what is being done and why. keep asking questions until you do understand. don't feel rushed. wishing you well!"	what is the success rate ofcervical c5-6 c6-7 anterior partical corpectomy disctomy fusion? . what is the success rate of a cervical c5-6 c6-7 anterior partical corpectomy disctomy fusion and instrumentation operation?
most helpful answer let’s start off with your question regarding the relationship between acne and heavy sweating. sweat does not cause acne. especially during the teen years hormone levels can stimulate excessive oil production. along with those hormones circulating throughout the body causing the excess oil the skin is going through a stage of change that predisposes it to clogging. that pore clogging can develop into pustules pimples whiteheads and blackheads. most foods do not cause acne. with that said it is suggested to eat a healthy and balanced diet. some anecdotal accountings recommend either reducing or eliminating chocolate carbonated beverages caffeine products excess sodium and fried foods. despite extensive marketing through info commercial and lofty prices there is no silver bullet product solution to curing acne. here are some recommendations and treatment that can lessen the acne outbreaks: even though acne is not directly caused by dirt keep your face clean and free of excess bacteria can reduce pore clotting. do not be overly aggressive in the face washing. applying too much pressure to the affected areas can actually aggravate the situation. from my own teenage years applying an astringent following face washing was very beneficial. cleaning pads containing salicylic acid can cause improvement and are relatively cost effective. be careful about using cover-up makeup products which can further cause pore clotting. do not be tempted to pop the acne blisters as this may cause spreading and infection. keep your body well hydrated and exercise on a regular basis. sleep for eight hours each night. you can search out acne home remedy treatments. the internet is loaded with various homemade recipes that may help. a paste made up of common everyday products such as baking soda and lemon juice work for some individuals. if improvement does not occur within 2 months of applying the above principles then it is time to consult with a doctor. they may prescribe medications such as retin-a accutane antibiotics and others to treat the acne. stay calm and positive. do not become overly stressed and allow acne to control your life. with extra efforts directed at maintaining optimal physical health you should see positive results in reducing acne.	i am 17 year teen boy. i have been getting acne on my face from last 3 years. what should i do? . well i am getting acne on my face continuously. i tried various products but none of them worked. 3 years i have been through this. i also have problem of more than average sweating. are they interrelated? what should i do to stop acne?

the tonsils may have little holes or crypts in them that can trap food and other debris. sometimes this debris can calcify and create a little stone-like mass called a tonsilliths (tonsil stone). since i have no way of seeing your little white spot first-hand it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to give you an exact answer based solely on your brief description. it is possible to have localized infections so since you are concerned it would be in your best interest to have your tonsils examined by a health care professional. since you are just getting over a cold it is certainly possible that it is evidence of an infection on your tonsil. one concern would be strep throat. however if you have strep your throat is typically quite sore with fever and oftentimes swollen glands in the front of your neck. if you feel fine otherwise strep throat is less likely. however if it doesn't go away after a few days get your doctor to check it out. another possibility is a tonsil stone. however since you had a cold recently the above is more likely. but here's more information about tonsil stones im not a doctor so dont take my word as gold but i get these little white spots on my tonsils too they irritate me like crazy one evening i had enough so i took a flash light and went into the bathroom and took my fingernail and poked at it and it popped out of the tonsil. and it stopped bothering me. i still get them a lot but i just go in there and get it out i think its like the first answer on here like a calcification.	i have a white spot about the size of a large grain of rice in the back of my throat on my tonsil of the left side. its a small white spot but it is very easy to see upon emamination. i have just gotten over a cold that did start with a very sore throat but that was about a a week ago now. there is only a spot on one side of my throat. i'm worried its some kind of infection. i can touch the area with my tonge and it is much warmer on that side of my throat than the other side. it is mildly irrated.

screening tests are those that are done at regular intervals to detect a disease such as prostate cancer at an early stage. if the result of a screening test is normal the disease is presumed not to be present. if a screening test is abnormal the disease is then suspected to be present and further tests usually are needed to confirm the suspicion (that is to make the diagnosis definitively). prostate cancer usually is suspected initially because of an abnormality of one or both of the two screening tests that are used to detect prostate cancer. these screening tests are a digital rectal examination and a blood test called the prostate specific antigen (psa). in the digital rectal examination the doctor feels (palpates) the prostate gland with his gloved index finger in the rectum to detect abnormalities of the gland. thus a lump irregularity or hardness felt on the surface of the gland is a finding that is suspicious for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a digital rectal examination in men age 40 and over. the psa test is a simple reproducible and relatively accurate blood test. it is used to detect a protein (the prostate specific antigen) that is released from the prostate gland into the blood. the psa level is usually higher than 4ng/ml in people with prostate cancer than in people without the cancer. situations of large prostate size infection and inflammation are other reasons why the psa may be elevated. the psa therefore is valuable as a screening test for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a psa in men age 40 and over. subsequent screening is recommended based on individual preference and assessment of risk for developing prostate cancer. for example patients with a high risk of developing prostate cancer due to a family history or a high initial psa should have more frequent evaluation (usually annually). although still considered controversial most urologists recommend regular screening for prostate cancer in men who are likely to live for more than 10 years. the american urological association (aua) issued their latest guidelines for prostate cancer in 2009. according to these men at the age of 40 should be offered a baseline psa test and a prostate exam (digital rectal exam or dre) to ascertain the risk of prostate cancer. subsequent screening and tests may be performed according to the findings on this initial evaluation and an individual's risk of getting the disease on the basis of other factors such as race ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer. as mentioned most urologists currently would advise some form of screening in men with a life expectancy greater than 10 years. most frequently it would be performed on an annual basis. although there is no definite cutoff age to stop prostate cancer screening most physicians would rarely screen men more than 75 years of age for this disease. results of the psa test under 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood are generally considered normal. there is a recent trend however to perform prostate biopsy in all patients with a psa more than 2. 5 ng/ml in order to detect prostate cancer at an earlier (and hopefully completely curable) stage. the american urological association guidelines (2009) do not define a definite cutoff point but advise that all the other risk factors for prostate cancer should be taken into account while making a decision on whether to proceed for a biopsy. one of the important factors that needs to be considered is the rate at which the psa value has increased over time on repeated measurements (psa velocity). results between 4 and 10 are considered borderline. these borderline values are interpreted in the context of the patient's age symptoms signs family history and changes in the psa levels over time. results higher than 10 are considered abnormal suggesting the possibility of prostate cancer. it has been shown that the higher the psa value the more likely the diagnosis of prostate cancer. moreover the level of psa tends to increase when the cancer has progressed from organ-confined prostate cancer to local spread to distant (metastatic) spread. very high values such as 30 or 40 and over are usually caused by prostate cancer.	what are the screening tests for prostate cancer?
thank you for the interesting question. i completely understand your logic. the laws are changing every day in the field of fertility. in the lab setting it has become common practice to increase the number of potentially viable eggs therby expanding the odds of pregnancy occurring. another example of these changes may be seen in the long held belief that a woman is born with a finite quantity of eggs at birth. this principle is being questioned in an animal study. please open the following link to a webmd article that discusses that study. <link> - although i’m not an expert in fertility issues i’ll share with you what i know to be accurate as follows: the number of follicles that will ever become a mature egg is partially dependent on the monthly cycle where a varying and undetermined number of follicles (potentially mature eggs) estimated to probably be in the neighborhood of 1 000 is lost. this follicle loss is also influenced by hormonal variations. the number of follicles remaining each month after the monthly cycle will influence the potential number of mature eggs in a woman’s lifetime. the more follicles that are lost monthly the sooner that the follicle supply will become exhausted and menopause will begin. with all of the advances in fertility it does not seen yet possible to calculate the number of remaining mature eggs after the monthly cycle.	when a woman is pregnant for 9 months does she save 9 eggs for 9 future ovulations?

most helpful answer need to? probably not. desire to? you bet. studies have shown that 90% of all men masturbate and the other 10% are probably lying. religious dogma aside there is nothing wrong with masturbation for men or women. does it improve sex life? maybe but if done excessively instead of sexual intimacy then the answer would be no. your wife should not be shocked by this normal natural act of self-pleasure and you should definitely talk about it. every man masturbates; there’s nothing wrong with it and it actually helps improve a man’s sexual ability by making him knowledgeable about what stimulation his penis responds to and in many cases by helping a man learn how to prolong his need to ejaculate. it also seems to help keep the prostate healthier which is a great thing. masturbating often makes a penis sore of course so do regularly use a top drawer penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) with a high end emollient like shea butter and a natural hydrator like vitamin e. hi found you some links they may help you both but it is a funny thing when our wives either catch us or find the wet hanky whoops? <link> <link> and this last link is so she can join you <link> there’s lots to read it wont hurt both of you if you read them together naked if you can the dodson ones your find are good. do hope this helps you. good luck	my wife is upset with me because she caught me mastubating but i read somewhere that men need to. is that true? . i read somewhere that masturbation is essential for men and can actually improve sex life. i want to know if this is true so i can talk to my wife about it. please advise.

"i'm sorry to hear you're suffering from this. the shoulder is a very complex joint so your symptoms could be caused by a number of things. usually when an x-ray is ""negative "" it means there's no broken bone which is a relief. unfortunately it's not possible to diagnose an injury like yours in an online forum. you've done the right thing by seeing a medical professional and getting an x-ray. that doesn't mean you shouldn't follow up and press for more details though. in fact this is exactly what i'd suggest. as long as the shoulder isn't getting better continue to follow up every few weeks with your healthcare provider. a few common causes of shoulder pain like you describe are: a damaged bursa a rotator cuff injury and ligament damage. injuries to the bursa or a ligament will heal with time. a rotator cuff injury may or may not; it depends on the severity of the injury. anyway keep following up with your medical provider. you may need to be re-examined to make sure you don't have a soft tissue injury that requires intervention. wishing you all the best!"

this is a not-uncommon situation. the answer depends a bit on how the wound was packed. for instance if you have sterile water and gauze you can wash your hands put on medical gloves dip the gauze in the sterile water and then gently re-pack the wound yourself. cover with a dry dressing. or if you're not able to do that (or not comfortable doing it) you can simply leave the packing out cover the wound with a clean dressing and call your physician's office when it opens for further instructions. leaving the wound unpacked for 24 hours or so isn't likely to cause a problem with healing. wishing you well!	what do i if the packing falls out of my absess

there are a few reasons for why the uterus measures larger than the dates. the most common reason is you are further in the pregnancy then you think. but since you had an ultrasound exam this is not the case. another reason could be you are carrying more than one child like twins. but if you had an ultrasound exam they should have seen this (although this can be missed). uterine fibroids (benign muscle tumor) of the uterus can make the uterus larger then you think. the other thing it may be is your doctor is wrong. it is just an estimation. i would not be too concerned about it at this time. when you see your doctor ask him about what the ultrasound exam showed. you can also call the office and speak to someone to read you the ultrasound results. uterus larger than the dates:? = wrong date (lmp) =polyhydramnious (excess amount of amniotic fluid in uterus) =larger baby (macrosmia) =multiple pregnancy =molar pregnancy =uterine fibroids =pelvic mass uterus smaller than the dates.? =wrong date (lmp) =oligo hydramnious =smaller baby (microsmia) =head engaged too deeply =genetic (maternal paternal small size) =intrauterine growth restriciton (iugr) =intrauterine death (iud)	what causes a large uterus?

a hernia repair requires surgery. there are several different procedures that can be used for fixing any specific type of hernia. in the open surgical approach following appropriate anesthesia and sterilization of the surgical site an incision is made over the area of the hernia and carried down carefully through the sequential tissue layers. the goal is to separate away all the normal tissue and define the margins of the hole or weakness. once this has been achieved the hole is then closed usually by some combination of suture and a plastic mesh. when a repair is done by suture alone the edges of the defect are pulled together much like sewing a hole together in a piece of cloth. one of the possible complications of this approach is that it can put excessive strain on the surrounding tissues through which the sutures are passed. over time with normal bodily exertion this strain can lead to the tearing of these stressed tissues and the formation of another hernia. the frequency of such recurrent hernias especially in the groin region has led to the development of many different methods of suturing the deep tissue layers in an attempt to provide better results. in order to provide a secure repair and avoid the stress on the adjacent tissue caused by pulling the hole closed an alternative technique was developed which bridges the hole or weakness with a piece of plastic-like mesh or screen material. the mesh is a permanent material and when sewn to the margins of the defect it allows the body's normal healing process to incorporate it into the local structures. hernia repair with mesh has proved to be a very effective means of repair. after the hernia repair is completed the overlying tissues and skin are surgically closed usually with absorbable sutures. more and more of hernia repairs are now being done using laparoscopic techniques (see below).	how is a hernia repaired?

"in 2008 i was asked to lead a half marathon team for more magazine’s annual spring run in central park. my team of peeke performers was comprised of women who were cancer survivors and included women who had triumphed over cancers of the breast thyroid lung and bladder. one woman ran with just one lung and did great. all of these women were extraordinary but one was a real character. that’s elaine doll dunn. like me she’s got a wicked wit and plenty of sass. tall and regal she looked ageless and in reality was 71 years young. she carried herself with grace and elegance but her impish grins gave away her real personality— a powerful survivor who brushed off her bladder cancer as a speed bump along a winding hilly and joyful life journey. that’s elaine. we did lots of pr for the half marathon including a segment on ""good morning america. "" her one-liners kept me laughing and her endless energy was astonishing. after completing the half marathon elaine insisted i come to south dakota and keynote her marathon in the spearfish canyon about 45 miles outside of rapid city. to sweeten the deal she informed me that the marathon weekend coincided with biker week where over 250 000 harley enthusiasts descend upon the town of sturgis (not far from spearfish) and basically rally tour the countryside and yes indeed have a party or two. i had a funny feeling she would become quite a fount of enlightenment for me. and i was right. as you know by now this coming sunday august 22nd i’ll be competing in the iron girl triathlon with a group of my patients the peeke performers. i was thinking about this upcoming race as i addressed elaine’s marathoners who were experiencing the usual pre-race day blend of anxiety and excitement. as i looked around the room i noticed that at least half the crowd of runners was women well into their 60’s and beyond. and i knew why. presently 73 years old elaine has been a living inspiration for women who dared to push their envelope at any age. and she’s been doing this for many years. her motto is: “i postpone death by living by suffering by error by risking by giving by loving. ” anais nin here’s a quick sampling of her achievements. at each age she: 52 — climbed 900 foot devil’s tower in wyoming 53 — had a major role in last of the red hot lovers. 54 — placed second in a body building contest that was not age grouped! 55 — ran the centennial trail 113 miles across south dakota from wind cave national park to the top of the sacred bear butte 56 — was challenged by bladder cancer and won. 57 — married jerry dunn during the disney world marathon and finished the race. they were interviewed on the today show just after the ceremony at the magic kingdom. 58 — climbed mt. kilimanjaro and won the marathon there the day after we got off the mountain. 59 — won the swimsuit competition in the golden times newspaper and was featured on the front page and as the centerfold. 60 — ran from the atlantic to the pacific ocean across panama 60 miles to celebrate her 60th birthday. 61 — became mrs. south dakota and participated at the national level for mrs. america. she was 30 years older than the other contestants. 62 — ran a marathon of marathons 26. 2 marathons in the year 2000. one of these was completed with three of her children who were running their first marathon. 65 — completed a doctor of philosophy in psychology researching the self-efficacy of women who begin marathoning after the age of 40. 71 — was the recipient of the spirit of dakota award annually honoring one woman whose leadership qualities courage strength and community commitment illustrate the best of south dakota womanhood. alright elaine’s quite an exceptional woman and i’m not asking anyone to start rock climbing at the age of 60 or pick up marathoning. however i just wanted to drive home the point with my velvet sledgehammer that it’s never ever too late in life to wake up get up and challenge yourself for mental spiritual and physical growth and fitness. become fearless and don’t be afraid to put it out there no matter your age. here’s the lesson. never say “i’m too old to do that. ” old is an attitude that gets in the way of living your life to the fullest. approach new challenges you may want to participate in with this phrase on your lips “that sounds interesting. i’ll give it a whirl and see what happens. ” don’t look at numbers. focus on the quality of every breath you take. age is after all just a number."	how can i age with vigor?

if your doctor suspects you have gallstones he or she will do a physical examination and may perform various other tests including the following: blood tests to check for signs of infection or obstruction and/or to rule out other conditions. ultrasound : this procedure transmits high frequency sound waves through the body. the echoes are recorded and transformed into images of various parts of the body. an ultrasound can be used to identify gallstones. cat scan : this test uses specialized x-rays to create cross-section images of organs and body tissues. cholescintigraphy (hida scan) : this test can determine whether the gallbladder is contracting correctly. a radioactive material is injected into the patient and makes its way to the gallbladder. the technician can then observe the movement of the gallbladder. endoscopic ultrasound : this test combines ultrasound and endoscopy to look for gallstones. endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography : the doctor inserts an endoscope through the patient's mouth down to the small intestine and injects a dye to allow the bile ducts to be seen. the doctor can then remove gallstones that have moved into the ducts.	how are gallstones diagnosed?

"no i wouldn't recommend wet wipes or anything like that for treating pinkeye. conjunctivitis is also called ""pinkeye"" and refers to inflammation (redness and swelling) of the membranes that surround the eye. usually conjunctivitis makes the white part of the eye look bloodshot and the lower lid may appear swollen. you may experience burning itching and drainage from the eye too. if you think you or your child might have pinkeye you should see a health care provider as soon as possible. there are different types of conjunctivitis some that do well with treatment. also conjunctivitis is highly contagious so you or your child should not go to school or work until the cause has been determined. be sure to wash your hands often and thoroughly if you have pinkeye. baby wipes antibacterial wipes and wet wipes should never be used around the eye. to get rid of the ""gunk"" (drainage) that often goes along with pinkeye use a wash cloth or paper towel soaked with lukewarm water and gently clean the outer eye area. cool compresses may help with the burning and itching. symptoms of pinkeye usually go away within a week. if you still have symptoms after a week it's time for a trip back to the doctor. hope this helps! sorry you're feeling miserable. absolutely not! see your eye doctor for meds. its an infection!"	does baby wipes anti bacterial wipes and wet wipes help ease the burning sensation of conjunctivitis?

i suggest you take your daughter to her pediatrician as a starting point. her symptoms should not be ignored. if the symptoms seem to come and go with her menstrual cycle the problem could be anemia from blood loss. drinking extra water and eating iron-rich foods (red meat fortified grains) might help the problem. however many things could be causing these dizzy spells and it's important you find out what's going on. if there's an underlying illness or condition the sooner you can treat it the better. wishing you well!	11 yr old daughter gets dizzy and will be for hours. today it was sudden and got very pale. where she stays during the day called me to say they were making brownie and she was stirring them up with a mixer and all of a sudden she had to go lay down because she was really dizzy. she was very pale after lying with her feet up and drinking some water she felt a little better not dizzy but not great either. she does wear glasses as of october of last year and she has started her menstral cycle
some people do notice that their hair can be thicker and fuller when pregnant and this is a hormonal fluctuation. so what happens is that your hair has three cycles of growth: it has a growing phase a resting phase and a falling out phase. sometimes with the hormones and the changes in pregnancy your hair stays in that growing phase longer. so you have more hair in that growing phase so your hair looks thicker and fuller and grows longer and often is more shiny as well. what happens though is three to four months after pregnancy when those cycle shift back all of a sudden that hair starts to shed as you revert back to your normal hair cycles. so if all your hair grew in the growing phase at the same time and then shifted to the resting phase every two to ten years or so you would go bald completely. but fortunately that pattern is not synchronized. so about 90% of your hair is growing and 10% is resting or falling out. so if that patterns shifts you might notice that your hair looks fuller for a while but there is a price to pay on the other side and then it will balance back out. yes mine did. and then after i had my baby girl i lost quite a bit of it <positive_smiley>	does your hair grow thicker while you are pregnant?
this is a very interesting question that makes me wonder if you're from the piedmont area of georgia where chalk eating is not uncommon among african american women. probably the most concerning aspect of chalk eating in terms of pregnancy is the possibility of becoming anemic. anemia is a condition that occurs when your blood lacks enough red blood cells to carry oxygen. being pregnant makes a woman more susceptible to anemia as it is let alone adding in chalk eating to possibly make you even more susceptible. some anemias can be caused by vitamin b deficiencies including folate (folic acid ) which could indeed harm a fetus. i don't know if chalk eating contributes to vitamin b deficiency anemias or not. another side effect of chalk eating is constipation. while this won't affect your chances of conceiving constipation can make pregnancy more uncomfortable than it needs to be. short answer: if you're trying to conceive or are already pregnant give up the chalk eating at least until after your baby arrives. best wishes to you!	can eating chalk harm my baby or stop me from getting pregnant?

stress is the link between high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels. both acute and chronic stress can trigger high blood pressure and increase your blood sugar levels. in an immediate crisis this is a good thing because the rise in your blood sugar level fuels your brain. however ongoing physical and mental stress is bad for your health. talk to your doctor about treatment for your blood pressure and discuss whether stress is part of the problem. although blood sugars can rise in normal people a blood sugar above 200 mg/dl or a fasting blood sugar above 126 mg/dl when confirmed and associated with symptoms indicates a diagnosis of diabetes.	can prolonged very high blood pressure be responsible for a very high blood sugar reading?

yes you can do this but remember that a fever -- especially a mild one in a child -- is actually helpful in fighting a virus. a fever is the one of the body's most powerful immune responses so it is not necessary or even medically recommended to treat a fever. you can however treat the discomfort associated with a fever so if your little one seems uncomfortable just use the acetaminophen or ibuprofen products that you mentioned. mucinex is a mucous-thinning agent and will not necessarily help a cough. loosened mucous can drain down a child's throat at night and actually make a cough worse so please keep that in mind. during the day mucinex is certainly okay. use saline nose sprays/drops and use a cool mist humidifier. colds last about a week but some symptoms like runny nose or cough can hang on longer. don't over-treat a cold.	my5 year old has a viral infection is it safe to give her mucinex with tylenol or motrin she gets a fever. the mucinex is just for cough
"i am not sure what kind of scans your chiropractor wants you to get but there is really nothing in any ""malpractice law"" that requires imaging studies. you can ask him to see a copy of this law in writing but i don't think there is one. i don't really no your case but scans may offer a clinician valuable information. at a cost of course. some mris can cost a thousand dollars or more so you do have to be financially responsible. consider getting a second opinion from an orthopedic specialist -- one that is covered by your insurance -- to see if a scan is necessary."	is a chiropractor required by malpractice law to keep doing scans? . i have gone to the chiropractor once a week it is all that i can afford they want me to go three times a week and they do not take insurance. they insist that i need to have scans done again because of malpractice insurance laws. i was told that if i did not get the scans done i would not be able to get adjusted there anymore. is this in fact a chiropractic malpractice law or is it just for the money? . thank you
honestly not always does that happen. but be mind that having inprotected sex and having your partner ejactulate while doing so is possible. it's not a myth that after a woman has her period that when she starts a new ovulatuion cycle that she is most fertile. it is actually proven and suggested if a couple wants a child that its the way to go about it. i would suggest getting a pregnacy test a day before or after you next missed( if it is missed) period.	we had sex the day after my period is it possible to be pregnant?

i don't know my chip-loving friend. i guess you just like them. we tend to choose what we eat and you are choosing this odd high-salt high carbo combination (a little protein in the cheese) instead of a normal balanced diet. what? no vegetables? at least you should add some lettuce olives salsa and vegetarian refried beans to the combo. make it a super-nacho! if you fear that this is an odd craving due to an underlying medical condition i can't think of one but i would advise you to eat a bit more sensible than that.	why do i want to eat tostito chip scoops and mozzarello cheese melted all the time?

no. thirst is not a sign that your cold is coming to an end. colds last about a week so if you are having issues with thirst this may not be related to your cold at all. please address this issue with your medical provider -- someone who knows your medical history someone who can examine you if necessary and someone who can order any laboratory tests including a blood glucose.	i am getting really thirsty is that a sign this cold is coming to an end?

typically the recommendation for dust mite and pet allergy is decreasing exposure. for dust mites this would include washing the sheets in hot water once per week keeping his bedroom vacuumed and implementing dust mite encasements for the pillow boxspring and mattress. in regard to pet allergy whether to get rid of the animals is a personal/family decision. at the least keeping the animals out of the bedroom can decrease exposure. his allergist can make more specific recommendations in the context of the severity of your son's symptoms and test results.	my son's allergy test rast score was 642. he is allergic to dogs cats and dust mites. should i get rid of the dog?
the liver is a workhouse for metabolism of protein and fat (lipids). when there is an excess of lipid in your blood than the capacity to metabolize by the liver the excessive lipids start to accumulate in hepatic cells known as fatty liver. this is an ongoing process if not taken proper steps to prevent it. i am sure that your liver is not in bad condition at all and it can be reverted to normal metabolism by regular exercise intermittent fasting use of omega fatty acids containing oils in diet reducing fat content in diet and by avoiding alcohol. the probable causes:diet and alcohol. investigations to be done:lft (liver function tests) and ultrasonography abdomen. probable diagnosis:fatty liver. treatment plan:conservative treatment. preventive measures:1. regular exercise. 2. intermittent fasting. 3. use of omega fatty acids containing oils in the diet. 4. reducing fat content in diet. 5. avoiding alcohol. regarding follow up:for further information consult a medical gastroenterologist online. ---> <link>	"Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old male.

"soiling the pants at age four is not consider ""normal"" so you need to discuss this issue with his pediatrician. he could be ""stool-holding"" -- a common problem with busy children who don't really want to take the time out of their busy day to have a bowel movement. they would rather suppress the urge but as you know ""poop happens"" after a period of time when he can no longer hold it. over time his distal rectum can become quite dilated so he may need some help in the way of stool softeners and watching him like a hawk to make sure he isn't doing the ""hide and poop"" game."	is it normal for a 4 year old boy to still be soiling his pants? he is fine with peeing during the day and overnight.

i don't know if you are a teen boy or girl but there are many things that can be done to control acne. acne is mostly caused by your raging hormones and those hormones are doing some very important things right now. you need them. consider acne an unavoidable side-effect. acne is temporary but it can last years. improperly treated or managed your acne can leave permanent scars so i would recommend that you see a dermatologist. yes some topical acne medications cause dryness and other temporary skin changes. you must learn to tolerate them for the greater benefit that can be achieved by remaining on them. i don't know what you have tried but under the careful eye of a trained medical professional i am confident that you can find the right medication regime that can achieve the optimum results. many teens expect too much; too soon when under acne treatment. they want a blemish-free face overnight and this does not happen. it can take months or a year or more of treatment to control acne. only getting older will cure your acne and unfortunately many adults will still get it. don't be frustrated. you are not alone and many of the adults around you were struggling when they were teens as well. the advantage you have now is that there are effective treatments. all we basically had when we were teens was soap!	why can't i get rid of my acne? . i've tried neutrogena clean & clear & prescriptions. all of them were either too strong made my skin dry out mad my skin peel made my acne worse or were too expensive. i don't know what else to do.
last year the obama administration issued new rules that prohibit group health-insurance plans — typically offered by employers — from restricting access to care by limiting mental-health benefits and requiring higher patient costs than those that apply to general medical or surgical benefits. the rules implement the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 (mhpaea). in other words the mhpaea states that a group health plan may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental-health benefits that are less favorable than any such limits imposed on medical surgical benefits. the affordable care act also takes steps to help people access the mental health services they need: right now if you haven’t been able to find health insurance due to a pre-existing mental-health condition you may be able to access the new pre-existing condition insurance plan. starting in 2014 substance abuse or mental illness can no longer be used by insurers to deny coverage as a “pre-existing condition” – and insurers also won’t be able to use those conditions to raise your premiums. also in 2014 mental-health and substance-use disorder services will be part of the essential benefits package a set of health-care service categories that must be covered by certain plans including all insurance policies that will be offered through the exchanges and most coverage in medicaid. these reforms all work to make the health-insurance marketplace a more accessible affordable place for people with mental-health and substance-abuse disorders.	under health-care reform when will there be fewer restrictions on mental-health sessions? . why is an insurance company allowed to limit how many therapy sessions a patient can have a year?
"the denture development process takes about three weeks to 1. 5 months and several appointments. once your dentist or prosthodontist (a dentist who specializes in the restoration and replacement of teeth) determines what type of appliance is best for you the general steps are to: make a series of impressions of your jaw and take measurements of how your jaws relate to one another and how much space is between them. create models wax forms and/or plastic patterns in the exact shape and position of the denture to be made. you will ""try in"" this model several times and the denture will be assessed for color shape and fit before the final denture is cast. cast a final denture adjustments will be made as necessary"	how are dentures made?
most helpful answer well i hope you understand that taking female hormones alone will never physically change your genitalia to that of a woman. in other words you will still have a penis and scrotum. however female hormones will gradually feminize your appearance and you will grow breasts. as i say this is a gradual process. it doesn't happen overnight. more like weeks to months. if you're transgender (as i'm assuming you are) i hope you're under the care of a trusted medical professional. i've had the privilege of working with many transgender patients and i know that products circulate illicitly within the community. i would urge you not to attempt to use female hormones without medical supervision. you don't necessarily know what you're getting with some of those black market products products purchased from websites and so on. if you are under the care of a medical professional good for you! he or she should be able to help guide you through the complexities of changing genders. i wish you all the best on this journey!	how soon i see if hormon therapy change me from male to female
i can understand your situation and know it is difficult to cope with a child with adhd/ odd. he might not be ready to take medications which is quite normal and acceptable. since it is necessary for him to take it you can give him medicatios by saying that they are some other ones and donot make him feel as if he is suffering from some disorder. give him time and be calm and patient. avoid any kind of struggle and arguments. recognise his good behaviour and offer rewards. ask him to do some yoga and meditation exercises which would relax his mind to an extent. spend quality time with him and involve him in activities which he is fond of. hope this helps!	hi doctor need advice. my son is 15 years and only yestday we were able to confirm he has adhd/add and now odd. doc has priscribed concerta 18. the issue is he his adamond and refusing to take the tab. saying there is no problem with my heath. we tried all tricks(with love with strick informent with rewards) but noting works. i sure one day he will realise. my question is should me give him this with out his knowledge like multivitain or painkiller and once he is in the doze for week then disclose or wait untill he realise. its very difficult time as parents.
first we have to talk about prevention. we can protect skin from ultraviolet light externally by using a sunblock. but you can do things like not smoking. smoking damages the elastin that helps keep facial skin flexible. sleep is important in making sure skin gets proper rest to heal itself. skin cells turn over at a rapid rate and they need time to replenish and rebuild. as for foods or nutrients that reverse aging vitamin a is certainly one of those and it comes from a variety of sources. carrots apricots nectarines sweet potatoes egg yolks [and] even some green things like spinach and broccoli. collards are a great source of vitamin a. vitamin d -- your skin converts sun into vitamin d but a lot of people have this sun phobia. you can get vitamin d from fortified foods like orange juice and milk. research is showing that the lowly mushroom is also packed with vitamin d. vitamin c is critical for wound repair -- for any type of tissue maintenance -- and that applies to your skin. tomatoes citrus kiwi -- they're all great sources. it is not necessary that every formulation gives the same effect just because these are intended for a same purpose. there are some anti-aging cream reviews that can let you know about some effective results these creams are able to produce. click here to know more details anti aging cream click here to know more details ==>> <link> i guess they can help. i am 79 years old and often asked what my secret is. people say i don't look my age. i only have one secret. i don't use any fancy skin creams just a moisturizer because my skin is dry. my secret? smile. especially when you look at yourself in the mirror. give that person the best welcoming smile you can come up with. that is your best friend sometimes your only friend. a smile makes you feel better and look younger. try it. it doesn't cost a thing. smile!	can food and nutrients reverse the aging process?
epilepsy is a common condition that causes repeated seizures. the seizures are caused by bursts of electrical activity in the brain that are not normal. seizures may cause problems with muscle control movement speech vision or awareness. they usually don't last very long but they can be scary. the good news is that treatment usually works to control and reduce seizures. epilepsy is not a type of mental illness or intellectual disability. it generally does not affect how well you think or learn. you can't catch epilepsy from someone else (like a cold) and they can't catch it from you. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what is epilepsy?

"i don't know. not all exposures to infectious disease will result in the disease. if your partner had oral chlamydia and it was not successfully treated it is possible. i don't know what he used for his treatment if the dose was appropriate or if he actually took it (some people lie you know). my recommendation for partners is to have ""proof of cure"" before having sexual contact again. that means that both people have to test negative after treatment. most chlamydia transfer is through sexual intercourse. if you do start having signs of chlamydia again you may need to be retested. at least one of you had to have sex with someone else in the immediate past -- the chlamydia came from somewhere -- so a firm pledge of monogamy is important in a relationship along with the use of condoms for added security and protection."	can i get clamydia from only receiving oral sex from an infected partner? . i was already cleared up with my clamydia my partner just took his meds the day before he gave me oral. did i catch it? . .
genital herpes tends to stay in the same area with each outbreak but subsquent outbreaks may be less severe. yes it can be only on the scrotum a fact that many men who use condoms to prevent herpes find difficult to accept. if you have it only on your scrotum it may not spread to the penis.	does genital herpes stay confined to only one area of mans organs can it be on only scrotum not spread to penis?
patients with infectious diarrhea tend to get better relatively quickly with supportive care. most infections will resolve with or without specific treatment such as antibiotics. patients with inflammatory bowel disease probably will require lifelong treatment to help control their symptoms. the goal as with any long-term illness is to allow the patient to live a normal life with minimal symptoms from the disease. patients with ischemic colitis need to minimize their risk factors for progressive narrowing of the arteries. these are the same risks as for heart disease including controlling high blood pressure diabetes and high cholesterol; and stopping smoking. patients with severe ischemia that leads to dead (gangrenous) colon require surgery to remove the gangrenous segment.	what is the prognosis for a patient with colitis?
"start with a gastroenterologist. in many cases this can be ""fixed"" with a combination of medications and even surgery. i have had bouts with chronic hiccups my entire life until i found a permanent over-the-counter medicine that cured them for me and keep me from ever getting them anymore (and i am in my mid-40's). i would get the hiccups for 1 to 4 days which would lead to other problems with the spasms flaring up my ulcer. i am not a doctor but i know it works for me and improved my quality of life 100%. the named-brand medicine is not labeled for a hiccup cure and the only main ingredient is what does the job for me. every day i take just one time-released tablet of just plain mucinex (blue and white box) made by reckitt benckiser. although it is designed to work as an expectorant to relieve chest congestion and it thins and loosens mucus it does a whole lot more for me. the main ingredient guaifenesin (600 mg) is what stopped my hiccups when i last had them mid-2012 and i have been taking one or two 12-hour tablets daily ever since. if you get another brand it will probably not be time released so be careful as it may work for 4 hours at the most. i hope this helps and please let me know if it does because it sure changed my life. my dad is having the same problem. did your dad's condition improved? if so can you please share what he did?"

maybe. if the tooth did not penetrate through the skin of the outside or the vermillion border (the pinkish part of the outer lip that meets the skin) has not been disrupted there may be little that can be done. most minor injuries of the mucosa side of the lip will quickly heal. i assume the tooth is fine. laceration repairs should be done within 8 hours of the injury so make your decision relatively quickly. if you are having any doubts whether he will need a stitch or two take your son to an urgent care facility for a hands-on evaluation. since i am unable to see the injury i can only offer you this general advice.	my 3 year old son fell and his tooth went through his bottom lip. do i need to take him in?

so if your partner’s body odor is keeping you awake there’s a few things you want to do. number one is look at their diet. body odor is very consistent with what it is you are eating. if you’ve ever heard of people sweating garlic you know what that means is that people who have high garlic content you can actually smell it in their body odor. oftentimes i have people shower before bed and change their clothes before bed. having a specific night wear specifically some type of pajamas is what you’re looking for. oftentimes if you’re going to have somebody who wears the same pajamas over and over actually a polyester is going to be better than cotton because cotton will absorb all of that odor when and the sweat whereas the poly-blend probably won’t.	what can i do if my partner’s body odor is keeping me awake?
obesity can be caused by genetics or environmental factors. the reason that you are having a hard time on losing weight may also be indirectly related to having a sedentary lifestyle. you can stay more active and be more mindful about the kinds of foods that you take in so you will stay in shape and prevent the appearances of unwanted fats.	is the reason why i can't lose weight and keep it off because of my family history of obesity? . i am a 19 year old female i have 1 child who is 14 months old. at one point after my child was born i was exercising 5 times a day and on a strict diet plan for 4 months. i only lost 15lbs during this time. after that 4 months i was only able to work out once a day and still on the same diet i gained half the weight back. my family is anywhere between 200 and 400lbs please help before it gets worse i currently weigh 220lbs.
"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. osteomyelitis is no fun that's for sure! the only way you'll find out the answer to your question is to ask. somnolence (sleepiness) is one of the main side effects of opioid pain relievers like morphine and oxycodone. often the first treatment for excessive somnolence in opioid users is to reduce the dosage. if that's impossible in your case then your doctor may consider prescribing something to offset the drowsiness. if you're experiencing severe sleepiness due to opioid use you need to be extremely careful about driving cooking (for example using knives or a food processor) operating machinery or any tasks that require keen awareness. you also need to make sure you're not so highly medicated that your breathing slows or stops. regularly check your lips to make sure they don't have a bluish tint around the edges and make sure your finger nailbeds stay pink as well. if you see any bluishness around your mouth or in your nailbeds you should contact your doctor right away as these can be signs of an accidental opioid overdose. i just want to add that your pain should not keep you ""bedridden.

your best bet for a good answer to this question is to consult your pharmacist. that said we usually tell women taking oral birth control pills to use secondary birth control (such as a condom) when taking any antibiotic (such as bactrim) because some antibiotics may reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. bottom line: if you don't know for sure if a particular drug is interfering with your birth control pills always use a back-up solution. hope this helps!	does bactrim interfere with or reduce the effectiveness of yaz (birth control) to prevent pregnancy?
xeomin has been fda approved specifically for the vertical frown lines between the eyebrows. apparently this product was previously approved for use in adults with cervical dystonia a condition in which spasm and contractions of the neck muscles produce a very uncomfortable and unsightly appearance. likewise it had been approved for blepharospasm which is involuntary flickering of the orbicularis muscle which surrounds the eye. to give you the most authoritative information i am now going to quote from a review article written by yael halaas md: “botox dysport and xeomin have a lot in common but they also have some important differences. unlike its predecessors xeomin does not need to be refrigerated. this may be an advantage when it comes to distribution. what’s more xeomin is “naked. ” there are no additives – just botulinum toxin type a. this may lessen a patient’s likelihood of developing antibodies to xeomin. when your body senses a foreign invader it responds by creating antibodies and launching an attack. if this were to occur with a neurotoxin such as botulinum toxin type a it may not have its desired effects. xeomin is said to be more like botox than dysport. it takes about one week for the full effects of xeomin injections to be realized and once this occurs the results last from 3-6 months. dysport xeomin and botox should not be used interchangeably. they should also only be administered by skilled injectors such as board-certified facial plastic surgeons in sterile environments such as medi-spas or doctors’ offices. xeomin should not be injected in beauty salons malls or at xeomin parties in the home. ” always discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of each particular product. i can tell you however that so far the botox cosmetic and dysport class of drugs have been very safe and very successful.	is xeomin as effective as botox or dysport for reducing the appearance of wrinkles?

if the boy parts touch the girl parts whether you ejaculate or not there is always a small chance that pregnancy could occur. sperm can be viable in the clear mucous that emits from your penis during sexual excitation. the chance is very remote however so i think you are good. this time. if your girlfriend is also having sex with someone else that would be a different story. having a little scare like this is good practice if you continue with your risky sex-play you are eventually going to have sex. why not try and prevent it? your partner should be on an effective method of birth control and you should be wearing a condom. an erect penis is a loaded weapon my worried friend. yes absolutely. if she is worried of possibly being pregnant then its always a possibility if she has been active in sex. i would think the next best question to ask is. could she be pregnant with my baby in which case i would highly doubt the possibility. you must ejaculate. she must be exposed to some way of having sperm get into her. otherwise either she is really young and fear filled from ignorance and myths she is a manipulator trying to make you feel guilty or she thinks she really is and has had sex with someone else and is still a manipulator trying to make you think its yours. you dont give her age or experiance or other times of sexual encounter. # rod moser pa phd this is not an answer i could not find a reply button. thank you very much for your quick reply it did give both of us a scare and we told each other that we would not be doing anything like that again. do you think that the levonorgestrel will help? should she take another to be sure? i know you said that there was a very small chance but i just really want to make sure. also is levonorgestrel the same as the morning after pill? thanks luis garcia	could my girlfriend be pregnant? . so last week my girlfriend and i laid naked in bed. we didn't have sex we did touch each other and i didn't not ejaculate. my gf told me that she has missed her period and she is worried that she may be pregnant. i told here that there was no way sense i did not penetrate her and i did not ejaculate. as a precaution i went to the drug store and bought her levonorgestrel a hormone that is used to prevent pregnancy. is there anyway possible that she could have gotten pregnant?
i think the two most important safety questions that a patient can ask the doctor is one will there be a fully accredited anesthesia specialist in attendance anesthesia specialist being either a certified registered nurse anesthetist or a physician anesthesiologist. that’s number one. second is the facility accredited? now accreditation is kind of a broad term. for instance the facility could be licensed by the state. states do that. hospitals are licensed. the state will license a facility. the federal government does the same. in other words you cannot operate on a medicare patient and expect medicare to pay for it unless they’ve given it the stamp of approval. by the way the standards are almost identical. and some facilities for whatever reason will have both the state and the federal government come in do their evaluation and asked to be approved. but there are also private credentialing companies that do this and by the way most hospitals in the united states are accredited by essentially what is called the joint commission. it’s called the joint commission on accreditation of health facilities. this licenses hospitals outpatient surgery centers radiology x-ray clinics. so again very high standards so that there is no a or b it’s all a. if you get the right answers to those questions you’ll feel comfortable. and i would tell you also parenthetically most of the doctor anesthesiologists that i know will not work in an unaccredited unlicensed facility because they would be compromised in the performance of their work. for example if the facility didn’t have all the appropriate life support systems why would the anesthesiologist want to be in the situation where if anything goes wrong he doesn’t have the technical backup. he doesn’t want to be in that position. he wants to deliver to the patient when needed if needed as remote as that possibility is he wants to deliver the best he has.	how can i be sure my cosmetic surgery will be safe?

there has not been to my knowledge any studies showing that sexual deprivation causes any harm. i am a 59yr old male with depression anxiety paruresis ocd & eating disorders ( ocd stopped when i began to take antidepressants clean from eating disorders for some five yrs). also the medications i take greatly lessen my sexual impulses (which i don't mind since i never acted on them). the main problem is to focus on the problems which are definitely affecting your quality of life such as the depression & anxiety. these may be a major reason why you have trouble keeping a job. contact your local federal office to see if you qualify for ssi and medical aid so you can see a qualified therapist and psychologist to get help for your emotional problems. these doctors should also be able to help you with your sexual worries. i wish you all the best my friend.	what are the effects of lack of sex? . is sex deprivation. documented. to cause any harm. i am a 41 male suffering from depression anxiety ocd and panic attacks. i have extremely strong sexual urges but i have been suppressing them and i wonder if this could contribute to or exaggerate my depressive suffering. could you please recommend other sources to learn more about this or any website which offer help to the likes of me. i have been jobless for a long time and can't afford expensive therapy so any free help will be great.
"i'm sorry you're experiencing this. it sounds painful and a little scary. what you're describing sounds like a lump in the skin which is good because these aren't usually anything serious like cancer. also the fact you have a similar lump in the other armpit is actually good news in this case because scary lumps like breast cancer don't usually present on both sides at the same time. you have a couple of options here. you can wait to see what happens. if this lump is a cyst it may eventually open on its own. you can try applying warm moist compresses several times a day to see if you can ""draw out"" the fluid from inside the lump. do not squeeze the lump or attempt to puncture lance or otherwise open it on your own. this can lead to serious infection. if the lump opens on its own allow it to drain freely by placing clean (if not sterile) gauze loosely over the wound. you may apply antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. then allow the wound to close on its own. you also could go see a doctor for a diagnosis. if this is a large cyst you may benefit from having it surgically drained or removed. if you develop a fever or more bumps you definitely should seek medical attention. wishing you well!"	armpit lump. i thought it was a spider bite at first since i got the same thing under my other armpit. but i can tell this isn't a bite. it's extremely painful even to move my arm for everyday activity and the lump is very defined and huge. i even noticed a very small lump growing above it. i don't know if it's getting to a risky point. i've only had it for about a week now and it's terrible. no head to drain it even when i try to bring pus to the service. i'd like to know what i should do.

hello i have been through your same problems. it is not a comfortable situation. when i had this problem i went to my family md. first he did a urine test. well this was all it took to figure out that i had a very bad bladder infection. bladder infections can cause nausea back pain leakage burning when you urinate and some pelvic pain. in my opinion i would go see my dr. but until you can get into the dr. i would not drink any sodas any caffine alcohol or anything with high acid ( things like oj). drink lots of water. but i would go to the store and get some cranberry juice or in the pharmacy in the vitamins section there is a cranberry pill that is a very high concentrated cranberry oil. which helps to clean your urinary tract. one of these (the juice or the pills) will help you out a lot. just follow the instuctions on the back of the bottle of pills or if you are going to drink the juice i would drink 4-6 ounces 4 times a day. until you see the dr. info from someone who has been through this. i take cranberry pills everyday now. i have not had as many problems with this anymore and i strated taking the pills this about 3 years ago. if you do start this. make sure to talk to your dr. about it when you see him for your appointment. good luck to you. i hope this helps you and anyone else that may read this. god bless	im having lower back pains and im having pains in my pelvic area and i am leaking urine for no reason. . i have to use the restroom about every hour. i feel sick every time i wake up. i have no idea whats going on. i have never had a kid before. i dont know what kind of doctor i need to see!

this is a very popular question that we get at the pharmacy. grapefruit juice is one of the ones that we have very good data on as far as what medications it can affect. i would advise to be careful with orange juice because some varieties are enriched with calcium which could possibly bind to a medication and not make it work as well. orange juice can also interact with some medications to treat other conditions like allergies. my rule of thumb is to take medications with a full glass of water -- it really is the best beverage to use to avoid any possible interactions.	is there a problem with orange juice or just grapefruit juice and blood pressure or cholesterol medication?

"i am sorry but there isn't any way around my answering this question without injecting some medical terms into the discussion. the sense of smell is referred to in medical terminology as the olfactory system. what you are describing in your question is called olfactory hallucinations. in the medical community the technical name for olfactory hallucinations is called ""phantosmia"" (probably derived from phantom). phantosmia can present itself in a very real manner. suffers smell an odor like smoke (or some other odor) and may even experience a gaging sensation. in actually there is really no smoke or environmental cause supporting that reaction. phantosmia can be caused by some serious medical conditions that require discussion and investigation with a doctor. these may include brain damage caused by tumors or trauma epilepsy and infectious damage to the olfactory. system."	why do i smell smoke and there is no smoke

“lesion” is a general word for a tissue abnormality. liver lesion is a term doctors use for abnormal areas noted on an imaging test of the liver. most often liver lesions are seen on an ultrasound computed tomogram (ct) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan. the term “liver lesion” is a general term. liver lesions could be anything from harmless cysts in the liver to areas of cancer spreading from the colon or breast. the appearance of the lesions on imaging as well as other diagnoses and test results can often help explain the cause of liver lesions. when the nature of liver lesions is unclear and a diagnosis such as cancer is possible a biopsy is often needed to determine their cause. i recently had to have a chest x-ray looking for lung lesions which i was told were mostly malignant. the test was ordered due to the sodium levels in my blood and urine were different and also because i am a long term smoker and have chronic bronchitis. that was all i was told. i am curious as to what type of lesions these could be and how bad it is.	what are liver lesions?
that is normally brought about by disruption or even blockage in the tiny ducts that connect glands in the lips with the surface of the mouth. sometimes the tiny ducts are cut and the mucus may not be transferred very well from the lips to the surface and it begins to still into the tissues that are present under the lining of the mouth causing formation of painless bumps. it is crucial to consult a doctor as the bump won’t heal on its own.

states may vary in what specific forms of information they will want you to have when you apply for a premium subsidy to help pay for a health plan sold in the marketplace – details have not yet been released (mid-july 2013). but in general you will need something to prove your income – such as a paystub or wage statement or your last year’s income tax filing. if you are self-employed or are paid in cash you may be asked to show a bank statement or a set of recurring bills for rent and utilities to back up your estimate of how much you earn. your statement of how much your income is will be checked against tax and social security records. if you under-estimate your income by a lot at the end of the year you will be required to pay back the extra subsidy amount you should not have received. you also will need your social security number and driver’s license or some form of identification that shows you are a legal resident of your state.	what information will i need to fill out a marketplace application?
"let's say you've already had a healthy balanced meal so that you're not hungry (hunger is a physical phenomenon and tells the body ""i need food for survival"") but your appetite (appetite is a psychological phenomenon and is about ""i want food"" because it tastes great) get stirred up. that means you should be fine but you're getting tempted. here are a few things you can do to quell appetite and rein in over-eating: 1) brush your teeth and/or use mouth wash. that'll take the tastiness out of most foods. 2) if you have to have something eat something that expands your stomach with few calories--- a low cal soup lots of veggies. 3) stay completely away from any sugary foods. the refined sugar will cause your insulin to spike and you'll end up with a ravenous appetite for more. talk about shooting yourself in the foot! 4) get plenty of sleep! this keeps the levels of leptin (a hormone that helps you feel satisfied) high to help control appetite."	how can i decrease my appetite?

kids can become dehydrated far quicker than adults. rehydration solutions are more important for children right from the outset. doctors are now becoming more open to prescribing antibiotics that children can take in case they get travelers' diarrhea. azithromycin can be useful in children. parents should check with their pediatricians before leaving home. nursing mothers should continue to breastfeed. the time to wean a child is not in the middle of travel. continue even if the mother has diarrhea -- but she must ensure that she is getting plenty of hydration.	what about children who get travelers' diarrhea?
if prevacid was the drug prescribed for your reflux/heartburn and it was helping your symptoms you shouldn't stop unless advised by your doctor. since calcium citrate (as in citracal) doesn't require acid in the stomach for absorption this is your supplement of choice. tums are made from calcium carbonate as is caltrate; they may not be totally absorbed while on an acid-reducing medication. the current standard recommendation for daily calcium intake is 1200 mg every day. remember that this number includes calcium from food. most people who eat a well-balanced diet get about 300 mg of calcium without even trying! if you include dairy products or calcium-fortified foods in your daily diet you can reduce or even eliminate the amount needed from supplements. to help estimate your daily calcium intake contact nof [national osteoporosis foundation] and request a calcium-calculator handout. note: you shouldn't take your prevacid and calcium supplements together. check with your doctor about the appropriate timing of the medication in relationship to your calcium citrate. vitamin d3 comes in several strengths over-the-counter so you should easily be able to find the amount you need.	i have osteopenia. i take prevacid and my doctor recommended 1500 mg of calcium daily. should i take them together?
here's what i suggest: four infections in peak cold and flu season (winter=october through april). three infections in non-peak season (summer). three months of persistent residual fluid behind the eardrum. three back-to-back courses of antibiotics for the same ear infection. if your child fits into one of these categories ask your child's doctor about a specialist referral.	how many ear infections are too many?
the vaginal and urethral areas are rich in blood supply just like the inside of your nose. it doesn't take much irritation to make these mucosal areas bleed but it would be nice if you (or your medical provider) can find the source. sometimes the tiniest of little tears can bleed. some urinary tract infections will present initially as bleeding so having a urinalysis would be good to make sure you do not have an infection.	i recently noticed that after i pee when i wipe there is some blood. but there isn't any blood in my underwear. i noticed this on sunday. there was a lot of blood but i finished my period a few days before hand. i don't know what's wrong this has never happened to me before. i can only see blood when i wipe. . i am not on my period.
so the best way to find out is to do the following: 1. whenever they did the ultrasound you should subtract 7 weeks and 4 days. this should give you the time when you ovulated. this will give you a very good idea when you conceived. you need to understand that ultrasound at that time is accurate up to one week. so the date you come up will be within one week of the actual date you conceived. .	i recently found out i’m pregnant. they said that i'm 9 weeks and 4 days. how can i find out when i conceived? . the doctors did an ultrasound and from the measurements of the baby. i've never really kept track of my periods because they are so irregular.
lupus is an autoimmune disease characterized by acute and chronic inflammation of various tissues of the body. autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. the immune system is a complex system within the body that is designed to fight infectious agents such as bacteria and other foreign microbes. one of the ways that the immune system fights infections is by producing antibodies that bind to the microbes. people with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body rather than foreign infectious agents. because the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can affect tissues anywhere in the body lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas. sometimes lupus can cause disease of the skin heart lungs kidneys joints and/or nervous system. when only the skin is involved the condition is called lupus dermatitis or cutaneous lupus erythematosus. a form of lupus dermatitis that can be isolated to the skin without internal disease is called discoid lupus. when internal organs are involved the condition is referred to as systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). both discoid and systemic lupus are more common in women than men (about eight times more common). the disease can affect all ages but most commonly begins from 20-45 years of age. statistics demonstrate that lupus is somewhat more frequent in african americans and people of chinese and japanese descent.	what is lupus? what are the types of lupus?

the simple answer unfortunately is no. the provision of the health reform law that started last september applies to insurance plans that exist or are newly purchased (grandfathered plans are exempt). the benefit does not extend to people without insurance. unfortunately those currently uninsured won't reap the benefits of this provision until 2014 when preventive services will be free under any health plan sold through health insurance exchanges. no doubt that's not the answer people want to hear. the law is scheduled to roll out in stages with the most significant provision – the requirement that everyone have access to health insurance – kicking in only two and half years from now on jan. 1 2014. if you're unable to afford health insurance on the private insurance market it's worth checking to see if you might be eligible for public options in your state. coverageforall. org is a resource offered by the foundation for health coverage education (fhce). on its web site you can search for insurance options around the country in one convenient place. go to the organization's eligibility quiz which will help you identify program information tailored to your specific needs along with associated costs a sign-up check list and links to every program available in your state. and at benefits. gov you can search for all of the government programs for which you may be eligible. you can also speak with someone by phone at: 800-fed-info.	i have no insurance. can i still get free screenings for pap smears and mammograms?

"hepatitis c is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis c virus. technically since hepatitis c is an infectious disease one might think that an infectious disease specialist (a subspecialty of internal medicine) would be the appropriate medical specialist to see. hepatitis c is more than a simple infection however. it usually is a chronic infection that often is associated with important damage to the liver. because of this fact patients with hepatitis c are most commonly referred for treatment to a specialist in gastroenterology (also a subspecialty of internal medicine). gastroenterologists specialize in diseases of all of the gastrointestinal organs including the liver. moreover there are gastroenterologists who specialize in diseases of the liver including hepatitis c. these specialists are called hepatologists. (""hepar"" means liver. ) whether patients with hepatitis c are treated by gastroenterologists or hepatologists depends on the expertise (gastroenterology or hepatology) available in the community the severity of any associated liver disease and the complexity of the contemplated treatment."	what kind of medical specialist treats hepatitis c?

as all of the clinical data in this area is retrospective in nature i can only comment on what has been published tgus far. most of these studies show no significant increase in the risk of congenital abnormalities in children born to women who have previously been treated with chemotherapy and intracranial radiation therapy for leukemia. likewise the rate of leukemia recurrence following pregnancy appears to be relatively low (although there is always a small risk of delayed recurrence of leukemia with or without pregnancy). you should of course discuss your concerns with both your oncologist and your gynecologist before deciding to try and have a child. based upon the available evidence however it would appear to be reasonably safe for you to become pregnant if your have been in complete remission for the past 10 years. if you do decide to become pregnant then you will have to be carefully monitored for any signs of all recurrence during and after your pregnancy;. sincerely/ robert a. wascher md facs <link>	i have 29 years old i'm a female from romania. when i was 19 i found out that i have all 98% of my marrow was cancer cells. i had 2and a half years of chemotherapy and also radiation to my head. after aprox. 8 months of chemo i went into complete remision. now 9 years later i'm steel in remision. i would like to have a baby and i want to know how pregnancy can afect me - my illnes - and if the baby will be in any danger while i'm pregnant and after he's born.

"stimulants in general tend to decrease appetite in certain not all children. over time this side effect seems to lessen but as in the case of your son for some children it may persist. weight loss is the result of this appetite decrease and not consuming enough calories during the day. therefore since the medication is effective and at ""the perfect dose for him "" right now i would suggest that you work on increasing your son's calorie intake. this however is often not an easy task! some suggestions include offering your son his preferred foods whenever he seems hungry; starting the day with a large calorie-laden breakfast early in the morning before the medication takes effect; increasing the calories in snacks during the day and at bedtime; and adding a high calorie supplement like ensure or shakes with ice cream etc. during the day. consult your pediatrician or a nutrionist to determine how many calories a day your son should be consuming and try to make sure this is the minimum he consumes to prevent weight loss. if you find this remains a problem i suggest you consult a pediatric nutritionist for additional suggestions. if the problems persists despite you and your son's best efforts you may want to discuss changing to a non-stimulant medication with your son's prescribing physician."	my son has add and mild autism. he has been successfully on concerta for 6+ years. can you help with his weight loss?
otorrhea (fluid leaking from the ear) is most likely from a ruptured eardrum (not as serious as it sounds) but of course this is just a guess since i have no way of examining him. the ciprodex should help but many medical providers would also use an appropriate oral antibiotic. there is absolutely no way to determine (even if i could examine him) the duration of this drainage. it will stop as the rupture heals. fever rarely concerns me. it is just the body's way of fighting the infection. fever alone is not an indication to rush the er so if your child is comfortable just wait until monday and speak with the ent. of course you know your son the best so use your best judgment in this case.	ear infection with leakage and fever. my 10 yr. old has an ear infection with fluid leaking from his ear and 102 temperature. he has an ent and we have been putting in ciprodex drops in his ear for the past 2 days. the fever went away for a couple of days but now it is back in full force. the leakage has not stopped (48 hours) and is pretty heavy at times. how long will the leaking last and should i be worried that the fever is back? it is saturday evening and his ent won't be back until monday. should i take him to the er?

treatments vary among urologists and are tailored to the type of prostatitis you have. correct diagnosis is crucial and treatments vary. it's important to make sure your symptoms are not caused by urethritis (inflammation of the urethra) or some other condition that may lead to permanent bladder or kidney damage. treatments can include: anti-inflammatory medicines along with warm sitz baths (sitting in two to three inches of warm water). this is the most conservative treatment for chronic prostatitis. antibiotic medicine for infectious prostatitis. these drugs are not effective treatments for noninfectious prostatitis. for acute infectious prostatitis patients usually need to take antibiotic medicine for 14 days. almost all acute infections can be cured with this treatment. for chronic infectious prostatitis antibiotic medicine is taken for a longer period of time usually four to 12 weeks. about 75% of all cases of chronic infectious prostatitis clear up with this treatment. for cases that don't taking antibiotics at a low dose for a long time may be recommended to relieve the symptoms. pain medications. muscle relaxants. surgical removal of the infected portions of the prostate. a doctor may advise this treatment for severe cases of chronic prostatitis or for men whose swollen prostate is blocking the flow of urine. supportive therapies for chronic prostatitis including stool softeners and prostate massage. other treatments for chronic noninfectious prostatitis include the use of the alpha blocker drugs such as hytrin and cardura. these drugs relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder to improve urine flow and decrease symptoms. other drugs that lower hormone levels such as proscar may help to shrink the prostate gland in some men. some people may benefit from avoiding spicy foods and caffeinated or acidic drinks. activities that aggravate the condition such as bicycling may need to be eliminated as well. many cases of abacterial (nonbacterial) prostatitis (also considered chronic pelvic pain syndrome) respond to a mix of treatments that include exercise myofascial trigger point release progressive relaxation and counseling. prostatitis is a treatable disease. even if the problem cannot be cured you can usually get relief from your symptoms by following the recommended treatment. be sure to follow the full course any prescription you are given even if you no longer have any symptoms. with infectious prostatitis for example the symptoms may disappear before the infection has completely cleared.	what is the treatment for prostatitis?

(a person having a seizure cannot swallow their tongue. ) once the seizure ends: roll the individual onto their side. attempt to clear airway of any saliva vomit or blood if possible check vital signs stay with patient until they demonstrate normal degree of alertness make sure all airways are clear and free of obstruction. talk to the patient in a calm and soothing manner (stroking hair is optional) assuring them that things are alright. stay with them until they regain normal alertness.	what is the proper first-aid treatment for someone having a seizure?

most people get hiv by having unprotected sex with someone who has hiv. another common way of getting the virus is by sharing needles with someone who is infected with hiv when injecting drugs. you have an increased risk of becoming infected with hiv through sexual contact if you: have unprotected sex (do not use condoms ). have multiple sex partners. are a man who has sex with other men. have high-risk partner(s) (partner has multiple sex partners is a man who has sex with other men or injects drugs). have or have recently had a sexually transmitted disease such as syphilis or active herpes. people who inject drugs or steroids especially if they share needles syringes cookers or other equipment used to inject drugs are at risk of being infected with hiv. babies who are born to mothers who are infected with hiv are also at risk of infection. what to think about hiv may be spread more easily in the early stage of infection when the first flu -like symptoms of hiv ( acute retroviral syndrome ) are present and again later when symptoms of hiv -related illness develop. the risk of getting hiv from a blood transfusion or organ transplant is extremely low because all donated blood and organs in the united states are screened for hiv. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what increases the risk of getting human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection?

you were wise to get this situation checked out because it is possible for a person to leak cerebrospinal fluid (csf) through a nostril and this is a dangerous situation that can lead to a serious infection of the membranes that surround the brain. however since you've had a battery of tests done that have shown the fluid leaking from your nose is not csf then you can rest assured your brain is fine. the fluid coming from your nose must be normal mucus. many people (myself included) suffer from a chronically runny nose. clear fluid coming from the nose can indeed be caused by allergies. there also is an interesting condition called 'gustatory rhinitis ' which is fancy talk for getting a runny nose while eating. since your runny nose comes and goes it does sound like it could be seasonal allergies. only your health care providers can solve this mystery for you. i wish you all the best.	when i bend over clear fluid leaks out of my left nostril it happend last year but it stopped now it happend this week. i have a deviated septum and mucus is always in my throat witch i have to spit contently i am terrified it could be a csf leak i had a mri of the head and it came back clear now it dose not happen all the time i can bend down now and it wont happen it maybe happens twice or once every year right now i have headaches and head pressure on my nose and face and back of head with headaches im also dizzy saw ents and doctors and blood test all came back fine doctors think its anxiet coulditbeallergies

"osteoporosis can be present without any symptoms for decades because osteoporosis doesn't cause symptoms until bone fractures. moreover some osteoporotic fractures may escape detection for years when they do not cause symptoms. therefore patients may not be aware of their osteoporosis until they suffer a painful fracture. the symptom associated with osteoporotic fractures usually is pain; the location of the pain depends on the location of the fracture. the symptoms of osteoporosis in men are similar to the symptoms of osteoporosis in women. fractures of the spine (vertebra) can cause severe ""band-like"" pain that radiates from the back to the sides of the body. over the years repeated spinal fractures can lead to chronic lower back pain as well as loss of height and/or curving of the spine due to collapse of the vertebrae. the collapse gives individuals a hunched-back appearance of the upper back often called a ""dowager hump"" because it commonly is seen in elderly women. a fracture that occurs during the course of normal activity is called a minimal trauma or stress fracture. for example some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while walking or stepping off a curb. hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. with osteoporosis hip fractures can occur as a result of trivial accidents. hip fractures also may heal slowly or poorly after surgical repair because of poor healing of the bone."	what are osteoporosis symptoms and signs?

for couples struggling with infertility it's a particularly cruel fact: not only can infertility cause a lot of stress but stress can affect fertility. it's known to contribute to problems with ovulation. for many people the longer you go without conceiving the more stress you feel. fears about infertility may also lead to tension with your partner and that can reduce your chances of pregnancy even further. after all it's hard to have sex if one of you sleeps on the couch. while it's a fact that coping with infertility is stressful that doesn't mean you have to give into it. if your doctor can't find a medical cause for your ovulation problems consider finding support groups or a therapist who can help you learn better ways to cope with the anxieties that come with infertility. the american society of reproductive medicine offers these tips for reducing stress: keep the lines of communication open with your partner. get emotional support. a couples' counselor support groups or books can help you cope. try out some stress-reduction techniques such as meditation or yoga. cut down on caffeine and other stimulants. exercise regularly to release your physical and emotional tension. agree on a medical treatment plan including financial limits with your partner. learn as much as you can about the cause of your infertility and your treatment options.	how does stress affect fertility?

for many of us our hair is our crown of glory. we all want healthy shiny hair. here are several tips to help in preventing split ends. 1. do not brush your hair while it is wet; instead opt for a wide-tooth comb. after you wash your hair it is up to 25% more elastic and more vulnerable to damage. 2. try to avoid using heated hair appliances on a daily basis. using blow dryers curling irons flat irons etc. every day can dry out and damage your hair. heat can be especially damaging to your ends. instead of using a curling iron try sleeping in rollers to maintain your hairstyle. to maintain a straight hairstyle wrap your hair at night and sleep in a silk scarf. to wrap your hair start at the crown of your head and brush your hair around your head. continue until all your hair is brushed around smooth. if you have a lot of hair try using bobby pins to keep your hair in place. 3. wear a silk scarf or a satin bonnet before going to bed. a scarf will reduce friction and protect your tresses as you sleep. if you do not like to cover your head when you sleep you can try using a satin pillow case. 4. do not use rubber bands to tie back your pony tail. rubber bands can pull your hair out and break it off. 5. trim your ends every 6 to 8 weeks. if you are trying to grow out your hair you can go 8 to 10 weeks between having your ends trimmed. 6. before you shampoo your hair wet your hair with warm water to open the hair cuticle. always condition your hair after you shampoo. when you rinse the conditioner from your hair use cold water to help seal the cuticles of your hair. 7. do not over brush your hair. brushing your hair 100 strokes per day for healthy hair is purely a myth; this will cause more harm than good for your hair. 8. eat a well-balanced diet. what you put inside your body will affect your appearance on the outside of your body. foods containing folic acid biotin and omega3 are always a great nutritional addition for your hair. 9. try to avoid chemically treating your hair. relaxers perms and certain color treatments can also cause damage to your tresses. it is always best to have a professional hairstylist perform these procedures for your hair.	how can i prevent split ends in my hair?

this is a hard question to answer because there's not enough information. let me give you some general guidance. if you friend's rash came on suddenly and she is experiencing a fever she should phone (not go to) an urgent care center right away for further evaluation. sometimes a rash like you describe can indicate a serious infection. if your friend's bumps have been slowly coming on over time and she's not having any flu-like symptoms then she should see a health care provider to evaluate what might be causing this rash. many things can cause the symptoms you describe including acne. only a health care provider can say for certain what is going on and this evaluation needs to be done in person. hope this helps!	my friend has red bumps all over her chest and now it has spread to her arms and face. some of them get white heads and she pops them and they just bleed alot.
"psychotic disorders contain similar traits. they usually contain hallucinations and/or delusional beliefs. delusions are kind of like irrational thoughts such as ""i'm being followed by the fbi. "" they also contain disorganized thinking. people with psychotic disorders usually have trouble having conversations with people because they cannot stay on track and keep their thoughts organized. they usually go off on tangents or talk about their delusions. they may give unrelated answers to questions kind of like they didn't even hear what you asked. they also contain odd behaviors; behaviors that are out of the social norm. these can be any number of odd behaviors. psychotic disorders are extremely complicated and are often considered to be on a spectrum or a continuum. people fit along a line instead of a specific group."	how does one identify someone with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

produce can become contaminated with salmonella shigella or e. coli during growing harvesting processing storing or shipping. it’s particularly important that you wash your spinach lettuce tomatoes sprouts and melons before handling or cutting them. wash all fruits and vegetables under running water before eating cutting or cooking unless they’re packaged and marked “prewashed. ” produce with a tough outer skin like melons and cucumbers can be scrubbed with a clean produce brush and warm soapy water before you cut into them — just in case there is bacteria on the peel. unwashed hands are the most common cross-contamination agent between raw meat poultry seafood eggs unwashed vegetables and ready-to-eat foods according to a study on food handling behaviors published in the journal of the american dietetic association. wash your hands longer and more often than you think you should. scrub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds with hot soapy water. it takes that long for the soap and scrubbing to remove some of the germs.	what food safety tips can reduce potential exposure to e. coli?

"thrush usually develops suddenly but it may become chronic persisting over a long period of time. a common sign of thrush is the presence of creamy white slightly raised lesions in your mouth - usually on your tongue or inner cheeks - but also sometimes on the roof of your mouth gums tonsils or back of your throat. the lesions which may have a ""cottage cheese"" appearance can be painful and may bleed slightly when you scrape them or brush your teeth. in severe cases the lesions may spread into your esophagus or swallowing tube causing: pain or difficulty swallowing a feeling that food gets stuck in the throat or mid-chest area fever if the infection spreads beyond the esophagus thrush can spread to other parts of the body including the lungs liver and skin. this happens more often in people with cancer hiv or other conditions that weaken the immune system."	what are the symptoms of thrush?
"while it is uncommon to conceive after having had a tubal ligation it can happen. moreover there is an increased risk of it being a tubal or ectopic pregnancy. thus you were wise to do a reliable pregnancy test given your prior history of super light flows while actually pregnant. if you develop any pregnancy symptoms your should have the test repeated by a gyn or local family planning clinic as an ectopic pregnancy can delay the production of normal amounts of hcg (pregnancy hormone). a more likely explanation for the ""too light flow"" would be a missed ovulation. if the pregnancy test is negative then the next most common cause of a missed period is not having ovulated that cycle. in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone ""stabilizes"" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don't decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus—as a missed/late period. alternatively just a small amount of the top of the lining can be shed which appears as a very scant flow. causes for not ovulating are many: thyroid problems pituitary problems ovarian cysts physical stressors (e. g. sudden increases in exercise crash dieting) emotional stressors (problems with partners children finances) increased body weight anorexia rotating shifts at work etc. you mentioned a prior history of ""weird periods"" that were ""never normal. "" that might also suggest alterations in your ovulations. there is a second less common cause for not having a period--or a too light flow. in some women the estrogen levels become very low. the levels are so low that no uterine lining is available to be shed. bottom line repeat the pregnancy test if you have pregnancy signs. if it is negative then you may want to keep a menstrual calendar. if your cycles become absent for three months (or are just minimal spotting) see your gyn or clinic for follow up. certainly if you develop other symptoms such as pelvic pain (e. g. ovarian cyst) get seen promptly. if your tubes are tied its almost if not completely impossible to get pregant. periods are wierd and not really predictable. just dont assume its over yet. wear something for the next few days just to make sure its completely over."	my periods have always been weird – never normal. my latest period lasted three days and is very light. what is wrong? . i took a home pregnancy test and it was negative. i also had my tubes tied. could i possibly be pregnant despite the test?

hirsutism is male-pattern hair growth in women. excess hair may be on the upper lip chest back or elsewhere. causes of hirsutism include: polycystic ovary syndrome (most common) congenital adrenal hyperplasia (an inherited adrenal gland disorder) drug side effects hereditary (genetic) cushing's syndrome cancer most women with hirsutism have polycystic ovary syndrome characterized by irregular periods (or none) and multiple cysts visible on the ovaries on an ultrasound. only a small fraction of women have some other hormone imbalance. these are usually easily detected by lab tests in the supervision of an endocrinologist internist or family doctor. remember that normal hair growth patterns in women vary by race and ethnicity: don’t let an airbrushed magazine ideal fool you into a false self-diagnosis of hirsutism.	what causes hirsutism?
to diagnose a woman's sexual problem the doctor likely will begin with a thorough evaluation of symptoms and a physical exam. the doctor may perform a pelvic exam to evaluate the health of the reproductive organs and a pap smear to detect changes in the cells of the cervix (to check for cancer or a pre-cancerous condition). he or she may order other tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the problem. an evaluation of your attitude regarding sex as well as other possible contributing factors (fear anxiety past sexual trauma/abuse relationship problems alcohol or drug abuse for example) will help the doctor understand the underlying cause of the problem and make appropriate recommendations for treatment.	how is a female sexual problem diagnosed?
you can become allergic to the ink at any time or any medicine that you are taking also. you can become allergic to it even though you have been on it for a very long time. so if you are having a reaction one thing is that it could be an allergic reaction but it could also just be something that is occurring in the area of the tattoo that has something to do with the tattoo but because there is pigment there you can't really see the skin clearly. so i would say that this is one time that even though you don't have insurance it is worth seeing a dermatologist to have the area evaluated to make sure that the skin is otherwise healthy. oftentimes with a simple cream they can knock out that allergic reaction if that's what it is or the hypersensitivity reaction another way of calling it or do a biopsy to see if there is anything else going on in that area that might be more serious that might need to be treated. it's also important to remember that itching is part of a tattoo's healing process. intense itching like want to scratch your arm off itching. when the old skin dies and flakes off the new skin growth itches like crazy for a few days before settling down. cool showers and your tattoo aftercare ointment gently massaged into the tattoo will help but all in all the itching will pass after the tattoo is healed. allergic reaction to the ink will look more like red speckles or spots all around your tattoo unusual oozing puss or smelly discharge. you will know within hours of receiving your tattoo if you are allergic to the ink. most tattoo pigments are completely organic and allergic reactions are rare - and most often to red ink. never put a first aid product or anti-itch lotion onto an unhealed tattoo you will first off be in a ton of pain and subsequently ruin your tattoo. - a tattoo artist.	the skin around my tattoo really itches. am i allergic to the ink? should i see a doctor? i don't have health insurance.

liposuction isn't weight loss surgery. it is cosmetic surgery. you do lose fat cells but the most is 6-8 pounds of fat and most doctors take out less since it is dangerous to take out more. in fact you might even retain water after the surgery which could increase weight. and if you do consume more calories then you burn you will gain weight liposuction or not. the point is this. if you do not continue with or start lifestyle changes like regular exercise and consuming the same or fewer calories than you burn then you will gain weight. liposuction simply is not a substitute for these things and doesn't magically cause weight loss. you can ask the doctor how much fat was removed and get the weight of it and if you have another procedure that would add to it but again if you're loooking for significant weight loss liposuction will not do that.	i have dropped a clothing size through liposuction and tightening will i also lose weight?

"it's difficult to give you a straight answer without a bit more background information. but let me at least explain a common misconception about thyroid lab tests and results so that you can talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns. usually thyroid function is measured using a blood test that looks at tsh (thyroid stimulating hormone). a high tsh number means a low level of circulating thyroid hormone in your blood. that seems backwards doesn't it? a low tsh number means you have a higher level of thyroid hormone in your blood. so if your tsh lab result was ""high "" you may still be hypothyroid. if your tsh lab result was ""low "" you may be considered in the normal range or in the hyperthyroid range. if in fact you have moved from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) your healthcare provider will discuss ways of treating this condition. in general thyroid disorders are highly treatable. you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your recent lab results and what they mean. that way you'll have peace of mind about what's really going on and what treatment options are available to you."	i have hypothyrodism have had this now for 3 1/2 years bloodwork said extremely low now im extremely high what next

chickenpox shingles and postherpetic neuralgia all result from infection with a single virus called varicella zoster virus. most people catch the varicella zoster virus as children. after a bout of chickenpox our immune systems never completely eradicate the vzv virus. they just chase it into hiding. varicella retreats into nerve cells deep under the skin near the spine. for most of us vzv lies dormant inside our bodies never causing further problems. in about one-third of people however vzv emerges from hiding travels along a nerve to the skin and erupts in a bumpy painful rash on one side of the body. this sneak attack is called herpes zoster or shingles.	what causes shingles pain?

surgery is indicated in a small group of children. it usually takes the failure of two or three anti-epileptic medications before a child would be considered as a potential candidate for surgery. in general this happens at least after two or three years of continuous treatment with medications. the failure might be due: to a resistance to the anti-epileptic medications that are available. to the presence of intolerable side effects to the anti-epileptic medication. to a combination of both. since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with anti-epileptic medications surgery should be considered. young age is not a contraindication for surgery and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. in fact there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. there is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain that helps with the recovery of functions that can be damaged at the time of surgery. this plasticity is higher in younger than in older children.	who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?

it's always kind of questionable whether or not to treat a suspected broken toe isn't it? if the toe is crooked or grossly deformed then i'd suggest you really ought to see a doctor at least to set it properly. if it's a severe break a doctor can give you some options for fixing it ranging from splinting to surgery. he or she also can tell you what long-term consequences you may face from fixing the break versus not fixing it. it also depends a little bit on which toe you're talking about. if you think you broke your big toe it's probably worth a trip to the doctor because the big toe is the most important one when it comes to walking. if you're talking about your pinky toe and it's not grossly deformed you might be able to get away with simply taping it to the adjacent toe in order to splint it. meanwhile keep the foot elevated to reduce swelling. as long as you're not allergic to over-the-counter pain relievers you can take them for the pain. good luck to you!	is it necessary to see a doctor if you think you broke a toe? . i got really drunk one night and the next morning i woke up to a severely swollen and bruised toe. i cannot bend it and it hurts off and on. is it necessary to have a doctor look at it or can i let it heal on it's own?

there are several ways to get infected with hepatitis c: sharing needles for injection drug use. accidentally getting pricked by a needle contaminated by infected blood. this sometimes happens to hospital workers. being born to a mother with hepatitis c infection. getting a blood transfusion from someone with hepatitis c infection. before 1992 blood could not be tested for hepatitis c. since 1992 all blood donated in the u. s. gets tested for the virus. if you had a blood transfusion or organ transplant before june 1992 ask your doctor about being tested for hepatitis c. some people on kidney dialysis have gotten hepatitis c from contamination of the equipment. it's possible to get hepatitis c from someone you live with if you share items such as razors or a toothbrush that might have had his or her blood on them. a person can get hepatitis c from getting a tattoo or body piercing with dirty tools. rarely a person can get hepatitis c from having unprotected sex with an infected person. this is more likely to happen if the infected person also has another sexually transmitted disease.	how do you get hepatitis c?

first you have to check urine for pregnancy. the pregnancy test will be positive from the next day after the missed periods. so you should get two lines if pregnant now. once confirmed have a scan to confirm the location of pregnancy. mtp (medical termination of pregnancy) kit will dislodge the pregnancy if it is intrauterine. so its location has to be confirmed whether inside uterus or not. unfortunately if it is in the tube then management is different. once intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed then you can use mtp kit any day sequentially. it is most effective up to 12 weeks of pregnancy earlier lesser the bleeding. you have a lot of time so do not be in a hurry. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My last period came before 43 days.

well you should visit your doctor for correct diagnosis. it can be due to infection. cut down your caffeine & soda intake as it may aggravate your symptoms. drink plenty of water and try with cumin and coriander water to reduce burning.	why do i have burning during urination once or twice a week? (please see details). i am unsure if it's a uti as it occurs randomly and not a majority of the time i urinate. the stinging usually begins when i am almost done urinating and a short while after. i notice that the urine is not cloudy but when i am done there is a slightly dense and cloudy liquid on the tip of my penis with the urine. after about 30 minutes the pain goes away and usually doesn't happen for another week. i have wondered if i am drinking too much soda caffeine or if this is some kind of infection.
most helpful answer yes and yes. children can get hpv sometimes through birth and this can result in hpv in a child's throat or larynx for example (laryngeal papillomatosis). untreated this can lead to cancer. teenagers who are sexually involved or children who are sexually-molested can definitely get hpv and this can lead to cancer later in life. it would be highly highly unlikely to get hpv after sharing a bathtub or just using a used towel or other dirty laundry. while viruses can remain on some objects for hours. perhaps longer on wet objects. it really requires more of an intimate contact for an extended period of time to a susceptible person for transmission. some forms of hpv do not lead to cancer. only certain strains. the common wart is an hpv virus. the hpv vaccine for the more dangerous cancer-causing strains is very important and can be given as early as age ten.	can children get hpv and if so could it cause cancer? . i have a 2 strains of hpv one low risk and one high risk. i'm scared my 1 year old could get it before she gets vaccinated from sharing the same bathtub and toilet or her accidentally using my towel one day climbing in my bed where i have had sex with my husband who's probably infected too touching our dirty laundry. i'm not sure how long the virus stays alive for on hands clothes or objects and if she could contract hpv when i change her nappy bathe her or when she touches her private parts.

"most helpful answer you ask a great question and i'm going to try to give you a great answer. if only it were that simple! first i think we should acknowledge your current girlfriend for informing you about her hpv diagnosis. that is a very responsible and brave thing to do. she is behaving the way every adult should act in this situation. as to your risk for developing hpv if you have sexual contact with your girlfriend well it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. human papillomavirus (hpv) can exist in the skin without manifesting as warts. this means you can't always tell visually whether or not a person has hpv and you can contract the virus through skin-to-skin contact even in the absence of warts. also a condom often does not protect against this contact because the hpv-infected area of a woman's vulva may contact the portion of your penis or scrotum not covered by the condom. all of that said hpv also can clear up on its own. one study showed around 90 percent of female study participants showed no trace of the virus about two years after their initial diagnosis. this means it's possible your girlfriend's body has cleared the virus on its own. on the other hand the hpv virus can go dormant for years. maybe your girlfriend's case is dormant not cleared. to your question about ""is your risk of getting hpv higher with this woman than with the general population "" the answer is yes if she is currently infected and no if she has cleared the virus. keep in mind if you contract hpv from this girlfriend you risk transmitting the virus to another girlfriend down the road (even if you use a condom). as i'm sure you know certain strains of hpv cause cervical cancer. you should consider whether or not you want to be even remotely responsible for spreading this potentially life-threatening virus. clear as mud? wishing you well!"	a girl i have been dating told me she has hpv. are my risks any greater with her than the general population? . we have not had sex. i guess she had some warts and they have gone away without recurrence for at least 5 or so years. . she is telling me it is no big deal. given the stats i wonder if my risks any greater with her than the general population. . i am in the process of divorcing and i logically know this will not be a lifelong thing with the new girl.

a lot of people are upset about the cost of health care under the law. the fact is the price of health plans are going up for several reasons including the fact that insurers are now required to offer richer benefits and because many of the underwriting practices insurers used to limit their risk (like denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions) are now illegal. for lower income people who qualify for a subsidy the cost of insurance may be quite affordable actually. many will have access to very low or in some cases no-cost coverage. but if your income is above the threshold to qualify you for financial help you'll likely find your costs going up. those optimistic about the long-term effects of the law believe that with millions more americans insured in time health care costs will slow. but that remains to be seen.	why is everyone paying more for health insurance? why do people have to switch doctors and companies? . why are my rates going through the roof? if i get the bare bones offered i lose. the president promised none of what is happening would happen so why is it happening?

two forms of high blood pressure have been described: essential (or primary) hypertension and secondary hypertension. essential hypertension is a far more common condition and accounts for 95% of hypertension. the cause of essential hypertension is multifactorial that is there are several factors whose combined effects produce hypertension. in secondary hypertension which accounts for 5% of hypertension the high blood pressure is secondary to (caused by) a specific abnormality in one of the organs or systems of the body. (secondary hypertension is discussed further in a separate section later. ) essential hypertension affects approximately 72 million americans yet its basic causes or underlying defects are not always known. nevertheless certain associations have been recognized in people with essential hypertension. for example essential hypertension develops only in groups or societies that have a fairly high intake of salt exceeding 5. 8 grams daily. salt intake may be a particularly important factor in relation to essential hypertension in several situations and excess salt may be involved in the hypertension that is associated with advancing age african american background obesity hereditary (genetic) susceptibility and kidney failure (renal insufficiency). the institute of medicine of the national academies recommends healthy 19 to 50-year-old adults consume only 3. 8 grams of salt to replace the average amount lost daily through perspiration and to achieve a diet that provides sufficient amounts of other essential nutrients. genetic factors are thought to play a prominent role in the development of essential hypertension. however the genes for hypertension have not yet been identified. (genes are tiny portions of chromosomes that produce the proteins that determine the characteristics of individuals. ) the current research in this area is focused on the genetic factors that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. this system helps to regulate blood pressure by controlling salt balance and the tone (state of elasticity) of the arteries. approximately 30% of cases of essential hypertension are attributable to genetic factors. for example in the united states the incidence of high blood pressure is greater among african americans than among caucasians or asians. also in individuals who have one or two parents with hypertension high blood pressure is twice as common as in the general population. rarely certain unusual genetic disorders affecting the hormones of the adrenal glands may lead to hypertension. (these identified genetic disorders are considered secondary hypertension. ) the vast majority of patients with essential hypertension have in common a particular abnormality of the arteries: an increased resistance (stiffness or lack of elasticity) in the tiny arteries that are most distant from the heart (peripheral arteries or arterioles). the arterioles supply oxygen-containing blood and nutrients to all of the tissues of the body. the arterioles are connected by capillaries in the tissues to the veins (the venous system) which returns the blood to the heart and lungs. just what makes the peripheral arteries become stiff is not known. yet this increased peripheral arteriolar stiffness is present in those individuals whose essential hypertension is associated with genetic factors obesity lack of exercise overuse of salt and aging. inflammation also may play a role in hypertension since a predictor of the development of hypertension is the presence of an elevated c reactive protein level (a blood test marker of inflammation) in some individuals.	what causes high blood pressure?

the prostate gland grows as men age with the fastest growth occurring at middle age. by age 50 5 out of 10 men have an enlarged prostate. by age 80 up to 9 out of 10 men have an enlarged prostate. 3 having an enlarged prostate does not always cause symptoms. as the prostate enlarges the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body) may become narrowed or partially blocked. the narrowed or blocked urethra is what causes the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). by age 55 over 2 out of 10 men have some symptoms. by age 75 5 out of 10 men complain of a decrease in the force of their urine streams. 1 in rare cases severe obstruction of the urine flow develops and may lead to complications including complete or partial blockage of the urethra urinary tract infection (uti) bladder stones or visible blood in the urine. every man's experience with bph is different. symptoms may be stable may come and go or may become more bothersome over time. some men find the symptoms to be mild and do not require treatment with medicines. other men find the symptoms bothersome and choose treatment with medicine or less commonly surgery. bph does not cause prostate cancer. but prostate cancer may cause symptoms similar to those of bph. it is important to have your symptoms checked by a doctor to be certain they are not caused by prostate cancer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get benign prostatic hyperplasia bph?

heart failure is the result of poor cardiac function and is reflected by a decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart called cardiac output. heart failure can be caused by weakness of the heart muscle which pumps blood out through the arteries to the entire body or by dysfunction of the heart valves which regulate the flow of blood between the chambers of the heart. the diminished volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) is responsible for a decreased flow of blood to the kidneys. as a result the kidneys sense that there is a reduction of the blood volume in the body. to counter the seeming loss of fluid the kidneys retain salt and water. in this instance the kidneys are fooled into thinking that the body needs to retain more fluid volume when in fact the body already is holding too much fluid. this fluid increase ultimately results in the buildup of fluid within the lungs which causes shortness of breath. because of the decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) the volume of blood in the arteries is also decreased despite the actual increase in the body's total fluid volume. an associated increase in the amount of fluid in the blood vessels of the lungs causes shortness of breath because the excess fluid from the lungs' blood vessels leaks into the airspaces (alveoli) and interstitium in the lungs. this accumulation of fluid in the lung is called pulmonary edema. at the same time accumulation of fluid in the legs causes pitting edema. this edema occurs because the build-up of blood in the veins of the legs causes leakage of fluid from the legs' capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the interstitial spaces. an understanding of how the heart and lungs interact will help you to better comprehend how fluid retention works in heart failure. the heart has four chambers; an auricle and a ventricle on the left side of the heart and an auricle and ventricle on the right. the left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and transfers it to the left ventricle which then pumps it through the arteries to the entire body. the blood then is transported back to the heart by veins into the right auricle and transferred to the right ventricle which then pumps it to the lungs for re-oxygenation. left-sided heart failure which is due primarily to a weak left ventricle usually is caused by coronary artery disease hypertension or disease of the heart valves. typically when these patients initially come to the doctor they are troubled by shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down at night (orthopnea). these symptoms are due to pulmonary edema that is caused by pooling of the blood in the vessels of the lungs. in contrast right-sided heart failure which often is due to chronic lung diseases such as emphysema initially causes salt retention and edema. persistent salt retention in these patients however may lead to an expanded blood volume in the blood vessels thereby causing fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary congestion) and shortness of breath. in patients with heart failure due to weak heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) both the right and left ventricles of the heart are usually affected. these patients therefore can initially suffer from swelling both in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and in the legs and feet (peripheral edema). the physician examining a patient who has congestive heart failure with fluid retention looks for certain signs. these include: pitting edema of the legs and feet rales in the lungs (moist crackle sounds from the excess fluid that can be heard with a stethoscope) a gallop rhythm (three heart sounds instead of the normal two due to muscle weakness) and distended neck veins. the distended neck veins reflect the accumulation of blood in the veins that are returning blood to the heart.	why does a patient with heart disease retain fluid?
chlamydia can be detected on material collected by swabbing the cervix during a traditional examination using a speculum but noninvasive screening tests done on urine or on self-collected vaginal swabs are less expensive and sometimes more acceptable to patients. while culturing of the organism can confirm the diagnosis this method is limited to research laboratories and forensic investigations. for routine diagnostic use newer and inexpensive diagnostic tests that depend upon identification and amplification of the genetic material of the organism have replaced the older time-consuming culture methods.	how is chlamydia diagnosed?

whooping cough is commonly thought of as sort of an old-time disease of childhood that went away with vaccination but it never really went away. vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your family. learn about 3 ways vaccines can protect babies in particular in this simple infographic from cdc: protect babies from whooping cough. infants too young to be vaccinated are at highest risk for disease and severe complications. in this case everyone around them who helps care for them should be vaccinated. pregnant moms are recommended tdap during every pregnancy to protect themselves and to pass protective antibodies to their babies. for kids pertussis vaccination starts at 2 months with additional doses at 4 months and 6 months. they get the pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus and often combined with other childhood vaccines. a booster is required at 15 through 18 months and another booster at 4 through 6 years before they start school. the tdap vaccine is recommended for all adolescents preferably at age 11 or 12. anyone who hasn't gotten it at age 11 or 12 should get a dose. if adults have never had tdap they should get a dose at any time regardless of when they got their last tetanus and diphtheria (td) booster. adolescents and adults need a dose of tdap even if they were vaccinated as children or have had a pertussis infection.	how can i prevent whooping cough?
unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to diagnosis a rash without actually seeing it first-hand. a description is really not sufficient to make this important diagnostic call and without a diagnosis treatment suggestions would also not be possible. you will need to see a medical provider or dermatologist so that you can be be properly diagnosed and treated.	i broke out in a rash only on my face. what could it be? . i did not change any products that i use on my face. same make-up face wash and lotion. i do have dry sensitive skin. i also have acne with regular breakouts but nothing like this rash before. its not that bright little bumps all over and itchy. i am 23
"atopic dermatitis is generally easily diagnosed based on a physical exam and visual inspection of the skin by a physician or dermatologist. additionally the history given by the patient and contributory family history help to support the diagnosis. a doctor may ask about any history of similar rashes and other medical problems including hay fever (allergies) and asthma. while currently there may be no single specific laboratory test that says unequivocally ""this is atopic dermatitis "" a skin biopsy (a sample of a small piece of skin that is sent to the lab for examination under the microscope) may be helpful to establish the diagnosis in harder cases. additionally gentle skin swabs (long cotton tip applicator or q-tip) samples may be sent to the lab to exclude infections of the skin which may mimic atopic dermatitis. since itching tends to be the main common symptom of the disease for many patients it is not possible to say all itching is atopic dermatitis. itching may be seen in many other medical conditions that have nothing to do with eczema. each patient experiences a unique combination of symptoms and the symptoms and severity of the disease may vary over time. the doctor bases the diagnosis on the individual's symptoms and may need to see the patient several times to make an accurate diagnosis. it is important for the doctor to rule out other diseases and conditions that might cause skin irritation. in some cases the family doctor or pediatrician may refer the patient to a dermatologist or allergist (allergy specialist) for further evaluation. a valuable diagnostic tool is a thorough medical history which provides important clues as to the possible causes of the patient's ailment. the doctor may ask about all of the following: a family history of allergic disease whether the patient also has diseases such as hay fever or asthma exposure to irritants sleep disturbances any foods that seem to be related to skin flares previous treatments for skin-related symptoms use of steroids and the effects of symptoms on schoolwork career or social life. sometimes it is necessary to do a biopsy of the skin or patch testing to determine if the skin's immune system overreacts to certain chemicals or preservatives in skin creams. a preliminary diagnosis of atopic dermatitis can be made if the patient has three or more characteristics from each of two categories: major features and minor features. some of these characteristics are listed in the box below. skin scratch/prick tests (which involve scratching or pricking the skin with a needle that contains a small amount of a suspected allergen) and blood tests for airborne allergens generally are not as useful in diagnosing atopic dermatitis as a medical history and careful observation of symptoms. however they may occasionally help the doctor rule out or confirm a specific allergen that might be considered important in the diagnosis. negative results on skin tests are reliable and may help rule out the possibility that certain substances are causing skin inflammation in the patient. however positive skin scratch/prick test results are difficult to interpret in people with atopic dermatitis and are often inaccurate. in some cases where the type of dermatitis is unclear blood tests to check the level of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) or ige (an antibody whose levels are often high in atopic dermatitis) are helpful. major and minor features of atopic dermatitis major features itching characteristic rash in locations typical of the disease (arm folds and behind knees) chronic or repeatedly occurring symptoms personal or family history of atopic disorders (eczema hay fever asthma) some minor features early age of onset dry rough skin high levels of immunoglobulin e (ige) an antibody in the blood ichthyosis hyper linear palms keratosis pilaris hand or foot dermatitis cheilitis (dry or irritated lips) nipple eczema susceptibility to skin infection positive allergy skin tests"	how is atopic dermatitis diagnosed?
you are correct. dark red or brown urine could be blood although there are medications and even certain foods that can change the color of the urine. this would have nothing to do with your recent hep b vaccine. one common cause of blood in the urine would be a urinary tract infection even if you are not feeling any other symptoms. just the way a nose can suddenly bleed the bladder can do the same. this would be high on my list if you were female. urinary tract infections are uncommon in men. a kidney stone can cause urinary bleeding as well. i would be advisable for you to see your medical provider today and have a urinalysis to see if you are indeed having a urinary tract bleed. if not your medical provider can search for other possibilities. two nights ago had dark red urine?	i am very concerned. i noticed today my urine if very dark and red or brown maybe blood. . the only recent change i have epericenced would be a hep b vaccine shot last week. i have no injuries. and this is a very sudden change.

the only sure-fire way to avoid getting genital herpes is to abstain from sex or have sex only with someone who is also herpes-free. short of that a latex condom offers some protection if it covers the infected area. remember you can get genital herpes by receiving oral sex (fellatio cunnilingus analingus) from someone with a cold sore on the mouth. likewise you can get oral herpes from someone's genitals by way of oral sex. keep in mind that your partner can be contagious even without visible sores. if you know that a sex partner has genital herpes you can reduce your risk by having sex (vaginal anal or oral intercourse) only when he or she has no symptoms. nevertheless genital herpes can be contagious even when there are no visible symptoms so you should always use a latex barrier such as a condom or a dental dam.	if i don't have genital herpes now how can i avoid it in the future?

most cases of female infertility are caused by problems with ovulation. without ovulation there are no eggs to be fertilized. some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods. ovulation problems are often caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). pcos is a hormone imbalance problem which can interfere with normal ovulation. pcos is the most common cause of female infertility. primary ovarian insufficiency (poi) is another cause of ovulation problems. poi occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. poi is not the same as early menopause. less common causes of fertility problems in women include: blocked fallopian tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease endometriosis or surgery for an ectopic pregnancy physical problems with the uterus uterine fibroids which are non-cancerous clumps of tissue and muscle on the walls of the uterus.	what causes infertility in women?

ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammation of the large intestine (colon). the colon is the part of the digestive system where waste material is stored. the rectum is the end of the colon adjacent to the anus. in patients with ulcerative colitis ulcers and inflammation of the inner lining of the colon lead to symptoms of abdominal pain diarrhea and rectal bleeding. ulcerative colitis is closely related to another condition of inflammation of the intestines called crohn's disease. together they are frequently referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). ulcerative colitis and crohn's diseases are chronic conditions that can last years to decades. they affect approximately 500 000 to 2 million people in the united states. men and women are affected equally. they most commonly begin during adolescence and early adulthood but they also can begin during childhood and later in life. it is found worldwide but is most common in the united states england and northern europe. it is especially common in people of jewish descent. ulcerative colitis is rarely seen in eastern europe asia and south america and is rare in the black population. for unknown reasons an increased frequency of this condition has been recently observed in developing nations. first degree relatives of people with ulcerative colitis have an increased lifetime risk of developing the disease but the overall risk remains small.	what is ulcerative colitis?
no single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. most doctors use a combination of the following methods to diagnose the disease and rule out other conditions: clinical history the doctor begins by asking the patient to describe the symptoms and when and how the condition started as well as how the symptoms have changed over time. the doctor will also ask about any other medical problems the patient and close family members have and about any medications the patient is taking. accurate answers to these questions can help the doctor make a diagnosis and understand the impact the disease has on your life. physical examination the doctor will check the patient’s reflexes and general health including muscle strength. the doctor will also examine bothersome joints and observe the patient’s ability to walk bend and carry out activities of daily living. x rays doctors take x rays to see how much joint damage has been done. x rays of the affected joint can show such things as cartilage loss bone damage and bone spurs. but there often is a big difference between the severity of osteoarthritis as shown by the x ray and the degree of pain and disability felt by the patient. also x rays may not show early osteoarthritis damage before much cartilage loss has taken place. magnetic resonance imaging also known as an mri magnetic resonance imaging provides high-resolution computerized images of internal body tissues. this procedure uses a strong magnet that passes a force through the body to create these images. doctors often use mri tests if there is pain; if x-ray findings are minimal; and if the findings suggest damage to other joint tissues such as a ligament or the pad of connective tissue in the knee known as the meniscus. other tests the doctor may order blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms. he or she may also order a joint aspiration which involves drawing fluid from the joint through a needle and examining the fluid under a microscope.	how do doctors diagnose osteoarthritis?

as a breast cancer survivor i can share what i've learned from my experiences. i am not a medical professional i can only give my opinions. mammograms do not always detect everything but they have a very important role to play in diagnostics. dense breast tissue most often will obscure many things during mammography therefore many doctors will order an ultrasound or mri. each of these diagnostic tools have unique strengths that play vital roles in proper diagnoses. it seems you are in great hands and that your doctor is doing everything possible to rule everything out without causing delay which would only increase your anxiety. i believe in prevention in all things. i believe in early detection saves lives. most lesions turn out to be cysts. however should a different type of lesion be found the sooner the better. if it should turn out to be cancerous the earlier it is found diagnosed and treated then better the outcome. also the earlier a tumor is diagnosed the easier the treatment. mammograms do save lives! i found my tumor myself through self-exam. i have a very aggressive form of breast cancer which grows very quickly so the lump formed and grew large quickly between my annual mammograms. my diagnosis triggered my sister getting her first mammogram through which two tumors were found. mammography saved her life! mammography also brings relief and joy! two days ago i underwent my latest mammogram and two years post diagnosis i am cancer free!	i am 34 years old my doctor has confirmed breast nodules. should i worry that my dr. ordered both a mamm and ultrasound? . i have been told the ultrasound is usually ordered based on the mammogram results. i wondered if it was cause for concern that he was shotgunning them both at once same day one after the other.

no most antibiotics they give for strep are: ammoxicilian ammoxicilian clavulanate(augmentin brand name) cephalexin or (keflex brand name). never heard of the drug you are speaking of. i know you don't have insurance but think of your health i recently thought i was having an ear infection so went to doctor but did not want to pay high medical bill so went to clinic inside walgreens and turns out it was only a skin infection of the outer ear. was given cephalexin for 10 days since i can only take liquid meds have troubles taking pills. i have insurance and ended up only paying $20 for the visit and $5 for the meds. you should try take care clinic at walgreens or minute-clinic at cvs their prices seem to be very reasonable. without insurance my visit would have been only $89.	ok so i have strep throat and i have a full perscription of non expired ciprofloxacin can i use that to treat strep? . i had a sinus infection a little while back and the doctor gave me ciprofloxacin for it. i never ended up taking it i just trooped through it and let it resolve itself as i have a fairly effective immune system. i know you are going to tell me to go to the doctor and have him look at it but i know for a fact i have strep i have had it before and i know how it looks and feels. im living on my own at 18 and i dont have the insurance to pay for a docvisit/antibiotics so can i treat it with cipro?

most cold medicines are pregnancy category b meaning there is no good proof that they are safe and no good proof that they’re not. certain cold medicines such as pseudoephedrine and phenlyephrine are category c meaning that animal studies have shown a risk to the fetus but human studies are lacking. there is a chance of fetal harm if the drug is administered during pregnancy but the potential benefits may outweigh the potential risk. acetaminophen (tylenol) is good at reducing fever and aches and is widely considered safe during pregnancy (although it has not been assigned to a preganancy category by the fda). ibuprofen naproxen and other nsaids are pregnancy category c. heated humidified air is safe and helpful for reducing nasal congestion. colds get better on their own. cold medicines don’t shorten the duration of a cold. and in clinical studies most cold medicines only reduce symptoms slightly. the cold does not pose any additional risk to the baby. all pregnant women should get the influenza vaccine during flu season which is safe for both mother and baby. catching the flu during pregnancy can be serious. many obstetricians are comfortable recommending common cold medicines that are probably safe during pregnancy. if you’re too miserable to make it through your cold symptoms call your doctor and ask what he or she recommends. what cold medication can pregnant women take for sore throat?	what can a pregnant woman take for a cold?

the ana (antinuclear antibody. ) is a blood test that when positive is associated with autoimmune diseases the prototype of which is lupus (sle). a + test by itself (titer >1:160) does not define sle since one needs to have the signs and symptoms associated with the disease. thus the test has to be interpreted in the context of the individual as evaluated by the doctor. the test can be falsely + i. e. + in a patient who does not have the disease (about 10%) or + in other conditions such as scleroderma sjogren's syndrome to name a few. if the test is negative the likelihood is that you do not have lupus since there are way fewer false negatives than false positives. if your doctor however thinks that you do have lupus (by signs and symptoms) despite the negative ana some other tests may be done by your md. finally the ana test is not done to follow the activity of the disease so it is unneccessary to continue to repeat it. .	what is an ana test?

creating a comfortable and ideal sleep environment is important for anyone trying to get a good night’s sleep. if you share your bed with your pet however you may want to reconsider. sharing your bed with your pets can interfere with sleep but it can be very hard for us to deny our beloved pets the opportunity to curl up in our beds. pets are like family members and we don’t like to exclude them from snuggling with us when they show so much affection and beg to be with us at night. however dogs and cats are just as likely to snore as your human bed partner and are much more likely to wake you during their nightly grooming rituals. allowing your cat or dog to sleep next to you may be harmful to more than just your sleep. a recent article suggests that letting your pets sleep in your bed or excessively lick your face can lead to your getting diseases and parasites. these conclusions are based on a study done by the centers for disease control (cdc) which claims that over half of people with pets allow them to sleep in their beds. interestingly the study also suggests that women are more likely than men to let pets sleep in their beds. we’ve always known that dogs and cats are carriers for fleas and ticks but some of the diseases and parasites outlined in the study are downright gross: mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) meningitis — even the plague! these diseases are classified as zoonoses as they are diseases or infections transmitted from animals to humans - if you’re having trouble sleeping the last thing you need are nightmares about zoonoses! this is not to say that you should start looking at your dog or cat as the harbinger of the bubonic plague — i have two dogs and a cat and my human family and i could never stop loving the members of our animal family. but i do advocate that people and pets have separate sleeping arrangements no matter how hard it is to convince your pet that he or she is no longer welcome in the bed. if you have allergies sleeping in a separate room than your pet may help with those as well. if you aren’t getting a good night’s sleep chances are high the dog next to you isn’t either — bunk beds may be the healthier option for both of you.	should my pets sleep in my bed?

most helpful answer this is a question only your doctor can answer. sometimes doctors keep their cardiac stent patients on blood thinners like clopidogrel (plavix) for at least one year after surgery. that's because platelets can stick to the stents and cause a blood clot. you should not discontinue the plavix unless your doctor specifically tells you it's ok. so. take a trip to the cardiologist and ask him or her when you can stop taking the clopidogrel. and good luck with the kidney transplant!	2 med stents december 2011. i am currently taking a daily plavix and 81mg aspirin. when can i stop the plavix? . when i get off the plavix i can get on the active kidney transplant list!

i'm sorry you're going through this! i'd advise you see your ob-gyn about this. several conditions can cause the symptoms you're describing and your doctor will need to take a sample of the discharge in order to correctly diagnose the problem. once your doctor has a diagnosis then he or she can discuss safe treatment options with you. i would not advise treating this yourself using an over-the-counter product. you're wise to realize everything about taking medication changes when you're pregnant. best wishes on your pregnancy!	i have a vaginal discharge like a yeast infection and it itches what can i do too stop it? . i have a vaginal discharge like a yaest infection and it itches what can i do too stop it while i am pregnant?
"this is a great question because actually the two drugs mentioned wellbutrin and geodon actually can cause some weight gain. so i would actually ask this patient number one are they telling their doctors that they -- they may be seeing two different doctors are they aware that they are taking these medications and do they have a medication list. because of the side effect profile we are adding a medication that we really probably don't need. i would like to be able to find a more non-drug option such as changing their diet increasing their fluid intake. so we want to make sure that that patient understands that. the pharmacist by looking at their medication list when they are coming to visit the pharmacy will be able to point that out and say hey you are getting an unnecessary medication for side effect of two drugs and maybe one of them they may not necessarily need. so that's where the pharmacist can actually contact the physicians or healthcare provider and say doctor are you aware of this? this happens all the time in the pharmacy. i can't tell you how many times i say to patients does your doctor know? well i went to this doctor for this medicine but this doctor doesn't know about this one. everyone needs to know about it. that's why that medication list is so important. not only is it help the pharmacist but bring it to all your other doctor appointments. that way they can see everything that everyone is prescribing and we can avoid medication errors and unnecessary use. i also have been on sooo many anti-depressants and other meds for bipolar ii and always gained weight. i am a 40 year old woman who is 5'1 tall and at that time almost 150 pounds. but i was just prescribed a very new anti-depressant called fetzima there isn't any generic version as of yet. i am on the max dose at 80mg daily. but add lamictal adderall xanax seroquel ambien xr propranolol imitrex injections cambia liquid spinx nasal spray and lastly phenergen 25mg prn migraine with vomiting. but my point which i apologize for going off in so many directions thanks to the adderall 60mg daily. the fetzima is supposedly much better as far as weight is concerned. it actually lists that weight loss is more common than weight gain. and while i would never suggest anyone to be on a stimulant/adderall when i have never been add/adhd. i take it daily and in a pretty decent dosage to somehow get me to function thru the day. it's hard to figure out as the patient why a doctor would put you on a lot of ""uppers"" and then you need ""downers"". it is crazy. but with the adderall i have been on for almost 3 months and in all honestly i now weigh 103 pounds. so over 45 plus pounds in that 3 months. i can't describe the feeling of having absolute no appetite i actually don't eat anything until my 11 year old daughter is home from school then while i am making her a snack and later dinner for the family i try my best to eat a few bites here and there cause i do not want my daughter to think i am trying on purpose to not eat cause i want to be skinny. and so i lose all my weight in my breasts my butt arms and legs and my face is caving in. i will always have a larger stomach after childbirth but if things continue like this i'll end up in the hospital. so please think seriously what is most important as far as getting out of the depression that is so dark been there but if you do end up with weight gain side effect please either eat very healthy and exercise safely and hopefully the depression meds will help enough you will find more days to not just take care of your mental illness but start living healthy and happier. i wish you all the best and know that depression can be just as or more fatal than being a little overweight or very underweight. best wishes malissa"	do diet pills interact with depression and bipolar meds such as wellbutrin and geodon?

it does sound to me that you very well may be suffering from hypothyroidism or at least a sluggish thyroid but it cannot be known for sure without more test results. what tests did your doctor run exactly? if he suspects it may by a thyroid issue he definitely should have ran a tsh free t3 and free t4 test at very least as well as some other tests that may will greatly improve the chances of diagnosing this correctly. without them it is hard to say because hypothyroidism can have overlapping symptoms with other disorders many of which can also be discovered through a comprehensive hormone test. i strongly recommend you getting one done if your doctor has not already.	hypothyroidism. i just had my blood works done and my doctor saw that my calcium levels are slightly above my normal range. my potassium has been low for quite some time now as well. for the past 5 to 6 years i have been feeling tired intermittently. i don't sleep well and when i wake up (even with 8 hours of sleep) i don't feel rested. also i've noticed that i've been having low-grade fever. i seem to be more sensitive to cold weather. i noticed also that i can feel some hot areas on my skin.

i believe that that product actually contains an antihistamine. what patients and consumers may not be aware is that many of the over-the-counter products contain antihistamines because they make you drowsy thus helping you fall asleep. they are safe when used properly and follow the directions on the box. but once again if you are taking benadryl or you are taking other antihistamines like zyrtec and things like that it has what we call an additive effect; drowsy plus drowsy equals really drowsy. so you want to exercise caution when using that. a lot of people too may not realize this can cause things like dry mouth. it could cause things like constipation. when you have too much of these drugs together they are actually drying you up and therefore leading to these other problems. we don't want to use these type of products in the elderly because of the fact that they can help them.	is over-the-counter product dormin helpful as a sleep aid?

"psoriatic arthritis is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (arthritis). psoriasis is a common skin condition affecting 2% of the caucasian population in the united states. it features patchy raised red areas of skin inflammation with scaling. psoriasis often affects the tips of the elbows and knees the scalp the navel and around the genital areas or anus. approximately 10% of patients who have psoriasis also develop an associated inflammation of their joints. patients who have inflammatory arthritis and psoriasis are diagnosed as having psoriatic arthritis. the onset of psoriatic arthritis generally occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life. males and females are affected equally. the skin disease (psoriasis) and the joint disease (arthritis) often appear separately. in fact the skin disease precedes the arthritis in nearly 80% of patients. however the arthritis may precede the psoriasis in up to 15% of patients. in some patients the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis can be difficult if the arthritis precedes psoriasis by many years. in fact some patients have had arthritis for over 20 years before psoriasis eventually appears! conversely patients can have psoriasis for over 20 years prior to the development of arthritis leading to the ultimate diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis is a systemic rheumatic disease that also can cause inflammation in body tissues away from the joints other than the skin such as in the eyes heart lungs and kidneys. psoriatic arthritis shares many features with several other arthritic conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis reactive arthritis (formerly known as reiter's syndrome) and arthritis associated with crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. all of these conditions can cause inflammation in the spine and other joints and the eyes skin mouth and various organs. in view of their similarities and tendency to cause inflammation of the spine these conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies.

you bring up two important issues regarding the treatment of adhd with medications. first the difficulty finding the right combination of medications when co-existing conditions are present and second the use of adhd medications during pregnancy. when choosing a medication to address adhd symptoms it is extremely important to keep co-existing conditions in mind and not make them worse with treatment. some co-existing conditions such as mild depression/demoralization or anxiety may be the result of untreated adhd and will improve once the adhd is treated. however some stimulants may make anxiety (or depression) worse particularly those in the amphetamine class so its best to avoid those if you can if you have anxiety. in addition other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) have been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety in persons with adhd. this treatment can be a particularly useful adjunct for those with anxiety/self-esteem issues or who can not take medications for whatever reason. that brings us to the second issue pregnancy and medications used to treat adhd. basically the stimulants are not recommended for use during pregnancy in order to avoid any possibility of damage to the developing fetus. there have been no studies done in humans but cardiac defects have been seen in animals given very high doses of stimulants during pregnancy. if you are contemplating getting pregnant it is best to discuss this with your prescribing physician and ob/gyn and wean off any stimulant treatment.	i'm a 29-year-old female with adhd depression and anxiety and can't find the right medication/treatment plan for me. al. i'm a 29-year-old female with adhd depression and anxiety and can't find the right medication/treatment plan for me. also willl my adhd be affected by my planned ivf?
there are certain key foods that really seem to keep you feeling satisfied for longer such as beans! i find when i have a bean burrito for example even if it's on the smaller side it really stays with me. another bean idea is edamame (green soybeans) just a bowl of these can really satisfy your hunger. basically foods with a lot of soluble fiber or protein and/or water content help make this happen. beans are rich in all three. smart fats can keep the contents in the stomach a little longer too. foods with monounsaturated fat (olive oil olives nuts) and omega-3s (fish canola oil walnuts soy and pecans). here are some foods rich in soluble fiber: beans. oats. barley -- look for soups with barley! some fruits (apples mango plums kiwi pears blackberries strawberries raspberries peaches citrus fruits). some vegetables (artichoke celery root sweet potato parsnip turnip acorn squash potato with skin brussel sprouts cabbage green peas broccoli carrots cauliflower asparagus and beets). one of the best pieces of advice for you though may be to drink some hot tea when you are feeling hungry again keep some liquid in your stomach and warm liquid tends to hang out in the stomach a little longer too. green tea is full of helpful phytochemicals so find some flavors you really enjoy (tropical green or peppermint green tea etc. ) or warm up some broth or tomato-based soups as a mid-meal snack.	any tips on finding healthier snacks that are going to keep me full?
i assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. i have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. the probable causes:the scrotal issues are due to the dryness of the skin and skin hair follicle infection. there is hyperkeratosis on the scrotal skin. all of these issues develop due to unhygienic urogenital habit and unhygienic skin condition of the areas of the external genitalia. no need to worry as i am suggesting very effective remedies for you to get better in a short period. the mouth sores are due to throat infection and it looks like a mixture of bacterial and viral infection. so you need to start the treatment immediately. treatment plan:for genital skin issues:- 1. the most important medical remedy for you is to shave the area completely including scrotum pubic area and the groins with a blade. make it a habit to do undershave (armpits and the genital area) before the hair grow very tiny. 2. keep the area clean and dry and apply hydrozole (combination of hydrocortisone and clotrimazole) cream on the whole of the genital area including scrotum. 3. you should take a prescription for amoxicillin. keep taking paracetamol every 8 hourly until you no more have fever. 4. apply some gel like orajel (benzocaine) on the mouth ulcers and stay for 5 minutes. then rinse with tap water. 5. do gargles with scope mouthwash. take plenty of water and proper rest. regarding follow up:for further information consult an internal medicine physician online. ---> <link>	Hi doctor,I am having 101 degree fever daily for past four nights.

"the condom can cause an irritation but so can the act of vaginal sex. especially for the first time. the redness or swollen area at the entrance to your vagina could be from some tiny tears along your hymen (assuming you still had one at the time you had sex for the first time) burning on urination could be ""cystitis"" irritation and inflammation at the opening where you pee (used to be called ""honeymoon cystitis"" back in the days when the honeymoon was the first time a woman had sex) or even a urinary tract infection. sexual activity can stir up a lot of germs in this area -- and germs can lead to a urinary or bladder infection. germs can come from fingers mouths (oral sex) as well as a penis. now that you have chosen to be sexually involved you have a responsibility to make adult-like decisions when it comes to your medical care. if you do have a urinary tract infection (burning on urination frequency urgency or even blood when you wipe) this needs to be medically evaluated. a urine test will not reveal your recent sexual debut so it is really up to you whether to disclose this information. a pelvic examination is not usually needed to make this diagnosis. only a simple urine test. my suggestion would be for you to get checked. just in case. women and girls of all ages can get urinary infections whether they are having sex or not. obviously infections are more common if you do have sex. i am pleased that you and your partner used a condom. make sure you use them 100% of the time or urinary burning will be the least of your problems. perhaps you need to use a water-based lubricant as well. i have also had this problem and i am allergic to latex. i would strongly suggest using non latex condoms from now on. if it still continues to hurt to the point you dont want to urinate i would go to a gynecologist. or the health department if you dont want your parents to find out. i have the same problem and i found out im allergic to latex. hi you could be in some kind of latex shock except they say there is not one but for the swelling use some crushed ice in a bag just keep it on your vagina for 20 minutes at a time this should reduce your swelling. and next time you have sex get yourself some latex free condoms. do hope this helps you. good luck"	can condoms cause the vaginal area to become red and swollen? . i just had sex for the first time with a condom. afterwards my lower vagina where the penis enters is now red and swollen. i have trouble going to the bathroom because it hurts so bad. i want to know what i can do to fix it without going to the doctor. but if i have to go i understand. tell me what is wrong and what i should do?

persistent migraines need to be defined a bit more by intensity frequency and the type of treatment you are using to elevate the pain. if you are using over-the-counter medications to treat your migraines more than 1-2 times per month then you may want to seek medical advice from your health care professional. prescription medications that relieve the symptoms would be the next step. if symptomatic relief medications such as ergotamines and triptans are used more than twice a week you should see your health care professional who can prescribe preventive headache medications. overuse of symptomatic medications can actually cause more frequent headaches or worsen headache symptoms. monitor the frequency of your migraines. understand the triggers to provide better information to your health care professional in order to help select the best treatment that is right for you.	what is the best way to treat persistent migraines?

start by using sun protection every day all year-round and re-applying every two hours if you are outdoors. this will allow your skin to repair itself as much as possible. i would also start with an over-the-counter regimen of moisturizers retinoids and antioxidants. the next level of treatment would be to see your dermatologist about in-office evaluation first to make sure that your skin is otherwise healthy -- no skin cancer or precancer -- and to review possible treatments such as chemical peels or laser peels. my favorite treatment for the right candidate is an in-office fractional co2 peel. this has about one week of “downtime” where your skin is red and you really need to be home. after that you can typically wear makeup and go back to your normal routine. the result is smoother younger healthier skin that with proper care will continue to look great for years.	i'm 51 years old and notice that my skin has changed. it looks like reptile skin and the color is uneven. what do i do?

most helpful answer based on the information in your posting it does not seem likely that this would be herpes let alone a genital herpes. the most likely cause would be a contact dermatitis (how in the world would you get poison ivy here anyway? ). it could be some residual chemicals in a laundry detergent soap dryer softeners or even the elastic band of your under-clothing. many things. instead of benadryl (which can cause some sensitivity reactions itself) a trial of hydrocortisone may be helpful. there is really no way to medical prove as specific cause if it is a contact dermatitis. herpes on the skin is painful. it is composed of groups of tiny water-filled blisters that rupture. the area surrounding these tiny blisters is red and irritated. it can itch but pain and tingling would be a more common symptom. there are certainly other considerations so i am pleased you are seeing a medical provider for a hands-on examination. hello i spent the last 3 months having herpes like symptoms and after a series of tests / doctors it was finally discovered that i had an e. coli infection on the skin around my genitals. it was very painful caused similar symptoms as herpes with tingling ulcers etc. but easily addressed with antibiotics. i would encourage your doctor to not only test for herpes but to swab for a bacterial or yeast infection as it may be something more benign than what you think it is. don't get too overwhelmed by what you read on the internet until you have something properly diagnosed. i know it can be months of agony but hang in there.	could it not be herpes? . i had a small itchy itchy itchy path about an 1-2 inch away from my bikini line on my inner thigh. i thought it was poison ivy so i put on benadryl cream and it seemed to stop the itching but the bumps raised and were somewhat sore but i don't know if that was due to friction they then scabbed and the itching started again. i havent had sex in 2. 5 months and have been with the same guy for over 3 years. i'm going to get a blood test next tuesday. . any advice?

"this could be a type of exertional migraine called ""orgasmic headache"". its pretty rare but something that we see occasionally in the headache clinic. there are medical article suggesting that some patients many have a problem like aneurysms as a cause for this but its not really clear if this is really a problem. i've seen a number of patients with this type of headache but i've never found any specific cause. some of the migraine type medications can work for this type of headache if it happens a lot. if it happens again you might want to talk with your doctor about an mri scan of the brain with an ""mra"" (mri arteriogram)."	twice this week i got a mind-numbing headache during sex. should i be concerned?
hi. thanks for the query. first of all if the thrush is still present you should get treated for it with antifungal medications oral as well as topical. secondly the symptoms of slight stinging and burning can be due to recurring uti or can be related to renal stones. an ultrasound as well as urine culture should be done so that appropriate treatment can be advised to you for complete eradication of problem. as of now drink plenty of water. hope this information helps. regards.

"first i'm very sorry to hear of your loss. my sympathy to you and your family. as to your question it sounds like you're asking about the ""manner of death"" listed on the death certificate. in general a death certificate has a section called ""cause of death "" which lists the direct event that led to a person's death such as ""myocardial infarction"" (heart attack). the death certificate usually also has a section called ""manner of death "" which often consists of checkboxes labeled ""natural "" ""accident "" ""homicide "" ""suicide "" ""undetermined "" etc. generally speaking a perforated bowel would be considered a ""natural"" death. a ""natural"" death usually is one that arises from a disease process or aging. keep in mind i am not a physician or lawyer. i'm just offering information based on my best knowledge of death certificates. if you have questions about your mother-in-law's death certificate you can consult the physician who certified the death certificate. his or her name should be listed. the centers for disease control (cdc) has a page on its website about how to fill out a death certificate. i am unable to link to it here but a search of their site should reveal it. again i'm very sorry for your loss."	is a perforated bowl death an accidental death? . my motherinlaw was admitted for stomach pain. intestinal block was found. surgery to remove block 4 days inpatient recovery then home. 2 days later returned with intense pain. small intestine collapsed and black. never wakes after sugery. cause of death stated as perforated bowl. is this an accidential death?

"you may find that soon after you are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes your blood sugar levels return to normal. you are in what is called the ""honeymoon period. "" the remaining insulin -producing cells in your pancreas are working harder to supply enough insulin for your body. you may take little or no insulin. but this does not mean that the disease is gone. after the remaining insulin-producing cells are destroyed the honeymoon period ends and you will need to take insulin for the rest of your life. treatment for your diabetes includes following a diet that spreads carbohydrate throughout the day getting regular physical activity monitoring your blood sugar levels (using a home blood sugar meter) and taking insulin. by working closely with your doctor and following your prescribed treatment you will feel better and have more control of your life. if your child has type 1 diabetes treatment involves the same tasks but allows for normal growth and development. before diagnosis your insulin level may have been low enough to cause severe high blood sugar with symptoms such as confusion or even coma. this condition is called diabetic ketoacidosis and often requires treatment in a hospital. during your hospital stay you are given insulin injections and fluids in a vein (intravenous or iv) and your condition is monitored closely. you are still at risk for this emergency in the future if you don't take enough insulin to keep your sugar levels and metabolism normal. if you have persistent high blood sugar levels over a long period of time diabetes can damage your: eyes ( diabetic retinopathy ). kidneys (diabetic nephropathy). nerves ( diabetic neuropathy ). heart (leading to heart attacks ). blood vessels (leading to strokes and poor circulation in your legs). if you keep your blood sugar level within a normal to near-normal range you may prevent or at least delay these complications. children seem protected from developing these complications during childhood. but when they become adolescents their risk begins to increase. keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible at the beginning of the disease will help prevent these complications. 3 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."	what happens to someone when they get type 1 diabetes recently diagnosed?
"this is an excellent question - and one you should ask the surgeon who performed the breast reduction. when i served as a reconstructive surgery nurse the doctor i worked with recommended a new baseline mammogram 6 months after breast reduction surgery. breast reduction surgery changes the ""architecture"" of your breasts and causes scar tissue deposits to develop so it's important to establish a new baseline image for a radiologist to compare your results against in the future. by the six-month post-surgical mark all of the absorbable suture should have dissolved and not appear on the mammo image. also you should be sufficiently healed so the mammogram isn't overly painful. the guideline i've mentioned here may not align with your surgeon's preferences which is why you should speak to him or her. also my comments only pertain to uncomplicated breast reduction cases. if you have developed a lump or other lesion that requires investigation with a mammogram then you should not necessarily delay the imaging test just because you recently had a breast reduction procedure. you should instead discuss the situation with your doctor and move forward with the recommended testing. wishing you well!"	when can a mammogram be done after breast reduction?

prostate cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor (growth) that consists of cells from the prostate gland. generally the tumor usually grows slowly and remains confined to the gland for many years. during this time the tumor produces little or no symptoms or outward signs (abnormalities on physical examination). however all prostate cancers do not behave similarly. some aggressive types of prostate cancer grow and spread more rapidly than others and can cause a significant shortening of life expectancy in men affected by them. a measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness is the gleason score which is calculated by a trained pathologist observing prostate biopsy specimens under the microscope. as the cancer advances however it can spread beyond the prostate into the surrounding tissues (local spread). moreover the cancer also can metastasize (spread even farther) throughout other areas of the body such as the bones lungs and liver. symptoms and signs therefore are more often associated with advanced prostate cancer.	what is prostate cancer?

mild back pain will often resolve on its own without seeing a doctor. however if the pain doesn't start getting better after a day or two call your doctor. if it's slowly getting better but you still have pain after a couple of weeks call your doctor as you may need treatment to help it resolve. if you're having any other symptoms with your back pain including chest pain or the pain is severe you're unable to move part of your body or you have weakness tingling or numbness in an arm or leg see your doctor. in other words if you just have mild to moderate back pain no other symptoms and you can relate it to a specific injury it should resolve on its own. of course any time you're concerned about any symptoms at all call your doctor. here's information on how to treat back pain at home.	should i get my backpain treated?

there’s no good evidence to back up this commonly held belief. the few studies that have tried to link the amount of caffeine consumption and height in kids did not show any connection between caffeine drinking and being short. most caffeinated drinks children drink are sodas and energy drinks filled with sugar as well as caffeine. sugary beverages don’t stunt growth they enhance weight gain. probably for this reason high intake of soft drinks may be also a risk factor for developing diabetes. reserving coffee and tea for grownups may not have scientific proof behind it but there’s nothing wrong with it either. sugary caffeinated drinks are best as a rare treat for adults and children.	does coffee stunt your growth?

"parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells or neurons in an area of the brain known as the substantia nigra die or become impaired. normally these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine. dopamine is a chemical messenger responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and the next ""relay station"" of the brain the corpus striatum to produce smooth purposeful movement. loss of dopamine results in abnormal nerve firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement. studies have shown that most parkinson's patients have lost 60% to 80% or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra by the time symptoms appear. recent studies have shown that people with parkinson's disease also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. norepinephrine which is closely related to dopamine is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system the part of the nervous system that controls many automatic functions of the body such as pulse and blood pressure. the loss of norepinephrine might help explain several of the non-motor features seen in parkinson's disease including fatigue and abnormalities of blood pressure regulation. many brain cells of people with parkinson's disease contain lewy bodies -- unusual deposits or clumps of the protein alpha-synuclein along with other proteins. researchers do not yet know why lewy bodies form or what role they play in the development of the disease. the clumps may prevent the cell from functioning normally or they may actually be helpful perhaps by keeping harmful proteins ""locked up"" so that the cells can function. scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with parkinson's disease and many more genes have been tentatively linked to the disorder. studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of parkinson's disease can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases. the same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental toxins or other factors. researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating parkinson's disease. although the importance of genetics in parkinson's disease is increasingly recognized most researchers believe environmental exposures increase a person's risk of developing the disease. even in familial cases exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease progresses. there are a number of toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 2 3 6-tetrahydropyridine or mptp (found in some kinds of synthetic heroin) that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans. other still-unidentified environmental factors also may cause parkinson's disease in genetically susceptible individuals. viruses are another possible environmental trigger for parkinson's disease. people who developed encephalopathy after a 1918 influenza epidemic were later stricken with severe progressive parkinson's-like symptoms. a group of taiwanese women developed similar symptoms after contracting herpes virus infections. in these women the symptoms which later disappeared were linked to a temporary inflammation of the substantia nigra. several lines of research suggest that mitochondria may play a role in the development of parkinson's disease. mitochondria are the energy-producing components of the cell and are major sources of free radicals -- molecules that damage membranes proteins dna and other parts of the cell. this damage is often referred to as oxidative stress. oxidative stress-related changes including free radical damage to dna proteins and fats have been detected in brains of parkinson's disease patients. other research suggests that the cell's protein disposal system may fail in people with parkinson's disease causing proteins to build up to harmful levels and trigger cell death. additional studies have found evidence that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with parkinson's disease may contribute to the death of neurons and that inflammation or overstimulation of cells (because of toxins or other factors) may play a role in the disease. however the precise role of the protein deposits remains unknown. some researchers even speculate that the protein buildup is part of an unsuccessful attempt to protect the cell. while mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation and many other cellular processes may contribute to parkinson's disease the actual cause of the dopamine cell death is still undetermined."	what causes parkinson's disease?

it sure sounds like you are becoming menopausal. one test that would probably help would be to do a blood test to measure your estrogen level (estradiol) and a hormone called fsh (follicle stimulating hormone) -- made by the pituitary and as the ovaries stop working the pituitary gets working harder to try to stimulate them -- and the fsh goes up. if you are having bothersome symptoms estrogen would most likely help -- and presuming you are basically in good medical health otherwise your health-care provider could prescribe it to you. another possibility as you mentioned that you were dealing with significant depression would be an ssri type antidepressant -- it might well help with your mood and should also help some with hot flashes.	i had a partial hysterectomy in my ‘40's. at 51 i have hot flashes mood changes and depression. is this is menopause?

type 1 diabetes is a type of diabetes in which the insulin-producing cells (called beta cells) of the pancreas are damaged. people with type 1 diabetes produce little or no insulin so glucose cannot get into the body's cells for use as energy. this causes blood sugar to rise. people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar.	what is type 1 diabetes?

1. depression may be inherited from family members. the more family you have that are depressed the more likely you will be. perhaps genetics is to blame for about 30% of depression where stress family upbringing trauma and personality style is the other 70%. 2. you may inherit genes for depression. you can also inherit the ability to respond to certain medicines that other family members respond too. so if your dad responded well to prozac your chances are good too as you likely have the same type of 'genetic' depression which was reversed by prozac in your dad. doctors should ask you if you have had a family history of depression and what meds your family took and their response to it.	can you inherit depression from your parents?
pleurisy involves inflammation of the lining of the chest cavity. this can be seen with anything that causes irritation of the pleura. the flu vaccine is more specific for infections with influenza a and influenza b viruses. these viral infections are not particularly associated with the development of pleurisy. although it is good to get a flu vaccine annually this will most likely not prevent the development of pleurisy.	if i have had pleurisy three times in the last three months will a flu shot help my situation?
kegel exercises also called pelvic floor exercises help strengthen the muscles that support the bladder uterus and bowels. by strengthening these muscles you can reduce or prevent urinary leakage problems. to do kegel exercises pretend you are trying to stop the flow of urine or trying not to pass gas. when you do this you are contracting the muscles of the pelvic floor. while doing these exercises try not to move your leg buttock or abdominal muscles. in fact no one should be able to tell that you are doing kegel exercises. kegel exercises should be done every day five sets a day. each time you contract the muscles of the pelvic floor hold for a slow count of five and then relax. repeat this 10 times for one set of kegels.	what are kegel exercises?

this is an excellent question! i can understand why this distinction could be confusing to some people because both stroke and a subdural hematoma involve bleeding inside the skull. however the two conditions are very different. in the simplest terms stroke involves bleeding inside the brain; a subdural hematoma involves bleeding outside the brain. when a stroke occurs a blood vessel within the brain tissue either ruptures or becomes blocked. this in turn deprives an area of brain tissue from receiving the oxygen-rich blood it needs to survive. stroke can occur without warning and often includes one or more of these symptoms : one-sided body weakness numbness or loss of function slurred speech trouble finding the right words sudden vision changes sudden balance changes severe headache a subdural hematoma on the other hand occurs in the tissues that surround the brain. many people don't realize the brain is wrapped in several layers of tissue for protection. first comes the scalp; then the bone tissue of the skull; then a tough fibrous layer of tissue called the 'dura mater;' then a webby layer called 'arachnoid' tissue; and lastly a delicate tissue-paper like layer called the 'pia mater. ' the brain itself lies below all of these layers of tissue. a subdural hematoma is a blood clot that forms due to a bleed that occurs below the dura mater and above the arachnoid tissue. a bleed can occur here due to trauma such as a concussion or other head injury. a subdural hematoma can cause pressure inside the skull to rise compressing delicate brain tissue and causing cells to die. it is a medical emergency that requires a procedure called a craniotomy to remove the blood clot and relieve swelling and pressure inside the skull. keep in mind i have greatly simplified the anatomy in this description. but i hope it helps you better understand how a stroke is different from a subdural hematoma!	what is the difference between a stroke and a subdural hematoma?
studies do not show that saw palmetto reduces prostatitis symptoms. saw palmetto has been shown in some small studies to help symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia). these symptoms include weak urine stream and frequent urination. there are other studies that do not show that saw palmetto is an effective treatment for these symptoms. prostatitis is sometimes but not always caused by an infection. often treatment will consist of several weeks to months of antibiotic therapy if it thought to be a result of infection. it's good that you are seeing a urologist for evaluation and treatment. your doctor should also be able to recommend treatment for your pain if you are not already taking pain medication. <link>	will saw palmetto help with prostatitis? . experiencing constant pain in glans and head of penis urologist says probably from prostatitis. i have read that saw palmetto can be helpful wondering if any experts think it is worth trying. i am also taking cipro currently without much improvement in symptoms.

catching a cold with emphysema or chronic bronchitis may also lead to bacterial infections such as pneumonia. this occurs because of the airway obstruction and the inability to cough up infected mucus. sometimes patients with copd are hospitalized because of a respiratory infection and the worsening of their symptoms. treatment may include inhaled medications oxygen and antibiotics to treat any bacterial infection. antibiotics do not treat a cold. to avoid more serious problems with emphysema chronic bronchitis and colds it's important to always alert your doctor if your cold symptoms get worse. don't wait until you have more serious breathing problems to contact your doctor.	why should i take colds seriously with emphysema or chronic bronchitis?
i'm extremely sensitive to urushiol even to the point of reacting to contact with mango skin. like others here i can verify that poison oak can react over a long period of time. back in august my cat escaped into the california woods covered with poison oak. i retrieved him but two days later i had one of the worst reactions on my arms that i imagine any human has ever seen. it's now april (8 months later) and the poison is still slowly seeping out of my arms. every week or two a single tiny hole opens up releasing some of the toxin and reacting to it. then over a span of days it will heal. however shortly after it heals another hole (or inflamed pore) will like clockwork open up in a different place on my arm to take its place. i see this as my body slowly purging the urushiol from skin and fat cells in which it has become entrapped. fortunately these subsequent reactions have been small and gradual over time. for those who experience a full blown emergence of the rash without repeated exposure check to make sure you're not getting urushiol from another source (e. g. mango skin).	can poison ivy rash return same place after 2 months? . rash returned same places on arms after 2 months since had first rash. . haven't been any where near any plants no pets to come in contact with poison ivy. any one ever hear of this happening?

"i have tried both ways and i believe that exercise to almost to the point and then draw back pushing though seemed to prolong my pain and definitely added to it. if you do push to hard then i would suggest that you immediately or as soon as possible be kind to your body with warm water soaks. i know it is frustrating when you are used to pushing through your body pain to do and be what you want. but there are painful consequences. it could cause you to be unable to do anything. i just know that ""pacing yourself"" is the watch word here. pacing yourself is a somewhat vague statement but it means to not to use all your energy doing one thing especially if you want to have other things in your life. it's harder to do than say and requires practice. we have athletes who do marathons and other difficult sport activities. i hope this help. start slow when they say 1 or 2 minutes they mean it but soon your body will be able to tolerate it at most times and never never think if you have to take a break because of a flare up that you can just pick up where you started before the flare up start slower and build back up. i have found that individual type sports like hiking swimming the non-contact sports seem to be best as it is easier to do that pacing i was talking about. good luck hope this helps. and do not forget to stretch!"

hashimoto's thyroiditis is not a reason to avoid pregnancy. however some women with hashimoto's thyroiditis do have trouble conceiving. in some patients supplementation with selenium is used to try to decrease antibody levels.

"you see? i answered your question so quickly i even confused myself. if you kiss someone with genital herpes (hsv-2) you cannot get herpes (oral or genital) from them. hsv-2 can only spread through direct contact. meaning you would need skin-to-skin contact with your infected friend's genital area to get herpes. and in that case the type of herpes you'd get would be hsv-2. hope that helps! to answer your question directly: if you kiss someone with active oral herpes you cannot get genital herpes from that contact. but that's not the end of the story. the old way of thinking was that herpes simplex 1 (oral herpes or cold sores) could not ""turn into"" herpes simplex 2 (genital herpes). however research has shown that's not exactly the case. however if you kiss someone with a cold sore then you can only get a cold sore (theoretically speaking). now if someone with a cold sore on her lip kisses your genitals then it's another story. in that scenario you could possibly wind up with genital herpes. i should mention too that the person you're kissing (or who's kissing you) doesn't have to have a visible active lesion to transmit the disease. in fact it's possible to be infected with hsv-1 and not even know it. and that's why it's all so confusing. wishing you well! hi i believe i have herpes. i had an outbreak (horrible) could not wear underwear and had to wear a dress just to walk. this is absolutely horrible and am surprised that no one has found a cure. why not? also i keep getting sores all over my abdomen (1 sore) and scarred my lips (swelled and another sore) could this be something else? i have never recovered from my first outbreak and am irritated all the time. i also have a dry rash on my back and front area that has not gone away. is all of this connected? please help. i have not dated and gained weight so no one would be attracted to me or want to ask me out. this is a very sad disease. please respond"	could i get genital herpes/hsv-2 by kissing someone who has it? or would i only get hsv-1 potentially that way? . i've read through a lot of data on herpes but am still confused about this. let's say that a woman has genital herpes. if i kiss her and end up contracting herpes from her will it be genital herpes/hsv-2 or would it be the more common hsv-1 herpes? . a shorter way of asking it is: can you only transmit hsv-1 through mouth-to-mouth contact?
many people have lower/normal body temperatures. you do not have to calculate a higher temperature concern based on this lower temperature. extremely high temperatures capable of causing problems will usually have a discoverable cause most likely a biological event. seasoned medical providers only use body temperature as just one of the evaluative guidelines but do not put a lot of emphasis on the measurement. people tend to fear fevers but fever is the body's normal response to fighting infection so in most cases it should not even be pharmacologically-lowered using drugs. it should be welcomed not feared.

hypothyroidism also called underactive thyroid disease is a common disorder. with hypothyroidism your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. the thyroid gland is located in the front lower part of your neck. hormones released by the gland travel through your bloodstream and affect nearly every part of your body from your heart and brain to your muscles and skin. the thyroid controls how your body's cells use energy from food a process called metabolism. among other things your metabolism affects your body’s temperature your heartbeat and how well you burn calories. if you don't have enough thyroid hormone your body processes slow down. that means your body makes less energy and your metabolism becomes sluggish.	what is hypothyroidism?

there are a lot of associations in medicine. if you have x condition you’re likely to suffer from y as well. if you’re at risk for a you’re also at risk for b and probably c as well. now we have a new connection to consider in my realm: it appears that patients with fibromyalgia have a high prevalence of rls — restless leg syndrome. fibromyalgia is a condition that affects the muscles and soft tissue. it’s considered the most common arthritis-related illness after osteoarthritis and its hallmark symptoms include chronic pain in the muscles fatigue sleep problems and painful tender points or trigger points at certain parts of the body. it can be difficult to diagnose because there is no single test for the ailment which is why doctors have to rule out other conditions before diagnosing fibromyalgia. more than 12 million americans have fibromyalgia. most of them are women ranging in age from 25 to 60. women are 10 times more likely to get this disease than men. because of the toll fibromyalgia takes on people physically it’s no surprise that patients have a harder time getting a good night’s sleep as they endure chronic aches and pain. but the link found between fibro patients and rls is intriguing. fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome share certain features: * women are more likely to suffer from fibromyalgia and rls. * there appears to be a genetic component because these conditions run in families. rls is equally a mysterious disorder in the sense that we don’t know exactly what causes it and as such we don’t have a magic bullet for curing it in everyone. sometimes an iron deficiency can be to blame for which there is a clear remedy. but many patients with rls do not fit into a tidy category whereby the direct cause is known. other problems that are sometimes linked to restless legs syndrome include kidney failure rheumatoid arthritis diabetes nerve damage anemia and parkinson’s disease but most people who seek treatment do not have any of these other problems. pregnancy accounts for many rls cases (and contributes to the gender disparity) and women who get rls during pregnancy often find that the condition vanishes after giving birth. the scientists who published the study on this association pointed out that fibromyalgia and rls share several characteristics. both conditions can include sensory alterations the use of antidepressants that can influence the dopamine system and beneficial effects for exercise. what’s more an important implication of the study according to the researchers is that restless legs syndrome is treatable with drugs that change the dopamine patterns in the brain. physicians are urged to ask fibromyalgia patients about symptoms such as leg movements when they are trying to sleep and unpleasant sensations in their legs. it goes without saying that alleviating these symptoms can enhance a fibromyalgia patient’s experience with sleep and overall quality of life. and it also should be noted that the recommendations for fibro patients are similar to those who seek relief from rls (or any sleep disorder for that matter). they include: * avoiding tobacco alcohol and caffeine. * getting regular exercise. * keeping your bedroom cool quiet and comfortable. the two problems with this study? for one the researchers determined the presence of rls among their participants through questionnaires. they weren’t able to factor out people with rls that can be attributed to medications they were taking at the time. and second because of the cross-sectional design of the study the researchers could not ascertain a simple cause-and-effect relationship. put simply further research is necessary to clarify a potential causal relationship between the fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome. i am however excited to see research in this area linking these two mysterious disorders and i look forward to more research.	is there a connection between fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome?
a cap or a crown is a dental restoration that covers an entire tooth like a new coat of enamel. a porcelain veneer covers the outside or visible face of the tooth. they are equally safe when used in the proper situations. for example if a tooth is badly broken down by decay and has no remaining support it needs a crown. if there is severe discoloration or chipping or misalignment of a front tooth a veneer may be the most appropriate treatment.	what’s the difference between a cap and a veneer? which is safer for your mouth?

the risk of pregnancy in using routine antibiotics and birth control pills (bcps) is very low. in fact antifungals (e. g. ketoconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin azythromycin biaxin) actually increased blood levels of estradiol--not decrease them. being late taking some bcps can also increase [the] risk of pregnancy but the risk is not large unless you entirely miss for two to three days. unprotected sex on active pills does not increase risk unless you had just completely missed several days of active pills. . i would urge you to do a reliable pregnancy test. for the most accurate answer you can do one test on the first day of your next pack. .	while on birth control i took an antibiotic and was late taking birth control pills. could i be pregnant if i had sex?

it's always worrisome when a loved one is experiencing painful scary symptoms like your husband's. in fact i always think it's harder to cope with these things when it's happening to my husband instead of me don't you? so many conditions could cause the symptoms you're describing. that's why your husband's physician is having him undergo an endoscopy. this test will help figure out what's going on so that you your husband and your physician can work together to put together a treatment plan. it's also possible the endoscopy is just one of several tests your husband's health care provider will run before making a diagnosis. it can be very hard to wait through all of this testing but hang in there. meanwhile remember to take care of your own health needs too. as the caregiver you're under a tremendous amount of stress and you don't want to get sick. be sure to eat right drink plenty of fluids and maybe go for a walk when you can. try to get plenty of sleep. you'll feel better and you'll be in a strong position to see your husband through this health crisis. best wishes to you!	something to worry about? colon cancer? . my husband is having an endoscope next week. he has has severe bloody diareha for years and he has massive swelling on upper left abdomen which started a few months ago. the pain is severe to the point where he feels as though he is splitting. in one month he has gained 30 pounds due to this mass on his side. he is 34 years old i am very concerned about the symptoms. i know we will find out soon but i'd like to know how to proceed after the endo and do his symptoms sound indicitive of cancer?
hi this is probably a side effect of snorting meth she may have throat inflamed and it would be tonsillitis also… this can be detected also by palpating the neck as the lymph nodes gets enlarged in response to inflammation of tonsils… ask her to garglewith salt and water tea with lemon and if there is inflammation of tonsils which you can also see from the mouth by openeing the mouth and pressing the tongue by a tongue depressor using a light source see if it is inflamed … in this case give an antibiotic like augmentin once every 12 hours.

that yellowish film you see probably is part of the healing process. as the body heals a wound it frequently produces an overabundance of proteins. these proteins often look exactly like your description: a yellowish film. this film often is described as thick sticky or gunky. as long as the area of the boil doesn't become extremely painful red or hot and as long as you don't start running a fever the healing process is likely proceeding normally. if you experience any of the above symptoms you should contact your primary care provider. you can gently cleanse the area with lukewarm water and mild soap. you don't need to scrub off the yellowish film. hope this helps!	should the boil form a yellowish film after drainage

the place to start is with proper skin care and this means sun protection every day all year round. after that i recommend using products that contain retinoids. you should also have your dermatologist evaluate your skin to better guide you as to whether or not microdermabrasion chemical peels or laser peels would be best for you. microdermabrasion is a superficial treatment that may help fine lines and wrinkles when used with the right skin care products. there are many different types of chemical peels available some are superficial and others can go to deeper layers of the skin. they should be done by your aesthetic/cosmetic dermatologist in order to have the best results and minimize risks.	i am 51 and am considering some facial treatments. what is the difference in microdermabrasion peels or other options?
one of the primary risk factors for malnourishment with ulcerative colitis is a decreased intake of food. when uc flares there is inflammation of the large intestine or colon and small sores form on the lining of the intestine and rectum. this causes persistent cramping pain. it also causes severe diarrhea alternating with the formation of hard stool and prolonged constipation. diet doesn't cause ulcerative colitis. but certain foods may make symptoms worse. so in addition to the normal loss of appetite that accompanies a flare-up some people purposely reduce how much they eat in an attempt to ease the symptoms or out of fear of symptoms getting worse. at the same time the body has an increased need for additional calories protein vitamins and minerals to aid the healing process. also the inflammation and diarrhea interfere with the reabsorption of water and minerals that normally occurs in the large intestine and there is a danger of becoming dehydrated if the fluid is not replaced. finally some of the medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis interfere with the body's ability to absorb and maintain the minerals it needs. for instance corticosteroids such as prednisone can deplete the body's calcium. medicines like sulfasalazine deplete the level of folate an important b vitamin.	what are the risk factors that cause malnutrition for someone with ulcerative colitis?
"okay so type 1 is common to oral area and type 2 is common to genital area. you just have type 1 on your genitals. it will not ""turn"" into type 2. your test will always come back positive for type 1 no matter where on your body it shows up. typical outbreaks happen during stressful or extra moist (for prolong periods of time). herpes outbreaks will become less frequent the longer you have had it. your partner is always at risk whether you have an active outbreak or not <negative_smiley> you can pass it days before you notice an outbreak. be honest with your partner - as you know this is a life long disease. always let your ob/gyn know. when you decide to have a baby they will give you a daily supressive med to keep from passing along to your child or you can opt for a c-section. good luck god bless and hope this helped."

it certainly warrants having a doctor check it out. you could be dealing with a hematoma -- a blood clot in the tissue that could compress a nerve or cause some other problem. (not to be confused with deep venous thrombosis which is something different entirely. ) you can start with a visit to your primary health care provider. he or she may order an x-ray or ct scan of your triceps to see if there's a hematoma hiding in the tissue of your arm. if there is your doctor may wait to see if the body successfully cleans up the excess blood cells. otherwise a minor procedure may be required to remove the knot. usually these types of big bruises heal up with no treatment at all. however given that you're still noticing a lump two months after the injury it doesn't hurt to have it checked out. wishing you well!	i hit my tricep and after 2 months the lump is still there should i be concerned? . i banged it pretty bad in a minor car accident and all the bruising has went away but the lump didn't and is still a little painful.

i am sorry to know about your problem. frequent urination is a common problem called overactive bladder. other than this mild pain in the urogenital region can be due to neural pain. masturbation usually does not cause these problems. i hope you had already taken a course of empiric antibiotics. i would suggest you try taking capsule tolterodine 4 mg and tablet nortimer (nortriptyline) 25 mg once at night for a month. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. for further queries consult an andrologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am a 27 year old unmarried male. I have a problem while urinating from past two years.  I have consulted my urologist, and we did many tests like urine culture, serum creatinine, and ultrasound KUB. After all these tests my doctor said there is no problem in my urinary tract. A few months later, I visited the same doctor, and he asked me to do thyroid profile test and uroflowmetry, but there was no problem with those test results. Finally, because of my frequent visits, my doctor did a cystoscopy, and he said everything in normal.Sometimes, I get a burning sensation in my penis when I urinate, from the past two years. I do not see any significant change in urine color. And sometimes I see some fluid in end of my penis; maybe it is prostate fluid. I frequently masturbate, minimum three times a day, from many years. I noticed that I get aroused without sexual stimulation. I also have little pain after ejaculation, and I feel that there is nothing wrong with the urinary system. I need to give more pressure to urinate, and I feel the penis does not carry the fluid properly. Can masturbation be the reason for all this? I am going to get married next year. Please help.
there are a number of things that could be contributing to your gas symptoms. the growling stomach you mention is actually your intestines contracting from the movement of air through the intestines. here are some potential causes of your gas: taking in air through drinking with straws carbonated beverages chewing gum smoking and eating hard candies. eating too many gas-producing vegetables such as cauliflower broccoli cabbage brussels sprouts onions artichokes beans and asparagus. certain fruits like apples pears and peaches may cause problems. the inability to digest certain foods like lactose in milk. not enough beneficial bacteria in your gastro-intestinal system. this webmd article provides more details on potential causes of gas. you may want to see a registered dietitian and/or write down what you eat to spot problem foods. and if you continue to have pain or discomfort a doctor visit makes sense.	my stomach always growls turns and feels bloated after i eat. i also have a lot of flatulence. what could be wrong? . i am not sure what is wrong with me. my stomach growls loudly and obnoxiously after i eat and it is very embarrassing not to mention the fact its very uncomfortable almost painful. i also have excessive flatulence in addition to this. i want to know what is wrong and i am tired of sitting in class with this issue it has been going on for at least 6 months now. i don't eat fast and i am definently not hungry and i have tried eating more frequent it doesn't help.
i would expect some inflammation and swelling but this sounds more than i have seen. i would give it some time as he suggests wear an athletic supporter 24/7 for a few weeks outside underwear to keep it snug -- gravity is not your friend here. also ask your urologist about taking anti-inflammation meds such as celebrex or over-the-counter but high-dose ibuprofen or aleve. maybe even ice up twice a day. stay in close contact with him.	2 months ago i had a penile implant. my testicle sac containing the controls keeps filling with fluid. will it go away?

ringworm is a fungus so allowing light and air to this area would not be a bad thing to do. if you do cover it when you are out and about do so loosely and allow some air circulation. this common fungal skin infection also called tinea corporis is only contagious by close direct contact so as long as you don't have a lot of wrist contact with someone else there is very little chance you will pass it on especially since you have been treating it for two weeks. it may take another few weeks before it completely resolves.	how long in ringworm contagious? . i have been treating it now for two weeks its on my wrist the size of a quarter. i have also kept it covered with a bandage but it seems to irritate it but id like to have the air hit it but not if im still contagious.

i'm sorry you're going through this and hope you feel better soon. i strongly advise you see your primary care provider as soon as possible to diagnose what is going on. it could simply be that you're young and working a lot and don't have time to eat. or it could be a symptom of a larger condition that needs to be treated. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose something like this from the internet. you need a physical exam and possibly some blood work to find out what's going on. you deserve to be treated if appropriate and live a full life. age 22 should be the prime of your life! i hope this helps.	as of lately i noticed a sudden weight lost(13lbs) i am always tired/sleeping even after sleeping a great amount. i am a petite 22 year old female. i never had such issues until recently. i sleep great amounts and yet i still feel very tired. especially when i do eat. i lost a total of 13lbs and i have no idea how. sometimes i do not even have an appetite. i also noticed a slight numb feeling on my right toe. at night i have trouble sleeping as well.
shingles is when the chicken pox virus stays dormant in the body and reawaken into a different and more aggressive form of the virus. this is a life long viral condition that can't be transferred to animals. animals can not have the same diseases or conditions as us because the biological composition is not nearly the same. the only way they can get infected is by the virus to evolve into same thing compatible with its immune system. the chemical recognition or better yet lack of will not allow them to become infected with human viruses.	are herpes and shingles in the same family. how long do shingles last and can it be transferred to animals

unresolved itching is a truly frustrating symptom for all patients to deal with. because this has been going on for some time you might want to get a medical evaluation to make sure you don't have a disease process that is causing the itching. the fact that you have identified stress as a possible trigger tells me that while it may not be the source of your difficulty it certainly could be making it worse. i would recommend that you look into stress reduction methods that are available in your area. some schools and universities offer programs in stress reduction meditation yoga etc. stress is hard on your entire body and could be negatively impacting other health systems as well as making your itching worse. see what you can do about getting a diagnosis and try to learn to manage your stress levels.	my lower leg has been itching and i’ve had slow-healing sores for five years. is it related to high stress at work?

any irritation of the skin in the diaper area can be considered a diaper rash. they are extremely common in babies especially those who have loose stools or who have very wet diapers (such as infants over 9 months). changes in a child's diet can also cause the stool to irritate a baby's skin even if she is changed right away. if the baby is not fussy it is likely not a serious rash and will probably go away after a few days of using a diaper cream or ointment. if a baby has a fever develops sores in the diaper area has bleeding or pus from the skin has a rash for longer than a few days or seems very uncomfortable it's important to have her checked out by the pediatrician.	what causes diaper rash and how is it treated?
good for you for quitting smoking! that is a true achievement to be proud of. in terms of the persistent cough one year later: that is a good question and i would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider (physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant). several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind. first depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus. although you're not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response. second smoking damages more than just the lungs. again depending on how long (and how much) you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle. if the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes congestion to occur. this congestion can cause a dry hacking cough - especially when you're lying down. i think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam. the cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time. best wishes to you!	why do i still get morning coughs a year after quitting smoking. no phlem. wakes me up at night. night and morning only.

I had my first manic episode 16 years back, for which I was put under psychiatric care for two months. Then again after a couple of years, I had some depressive symptoms for which I was prescribed Escitalopram 20 mg once daily and some ayurvedic herbs for two years. After that again six years ago, I had a second manic episode for which I was hospitalized for two months and diagnosed with a schizophrenic disorder, and was given Lithium carbonate 500 mg twice daily and Amisulpride 50 mg before bedtime. Due to some thyroid elevation problem, Magnesium valproate 200 mg twice daily was prescribed instead of Lithium carbonate. But from the past three months, I am experiencing loss of appetite, lethargy, weight loss, abdominal cramp, and acidity.My psychiatrist put me on Bupropion 150 mg once daily, which caused tremors and sweating. So he changed it into Clonazepam, which is causing acute indigestion. Please suggest some medicines as am losing a lot of weight and feeling lethargic.

prilosec 20 mg is the approved over-the-counter dosage by the fda for consumers to use safely. the medication should be used once daily according to the label on the product. it is important to realize that nexium and prilosec are two different medications and the strengths should not be compared as equal. different studies have been conducted for each medication individually to determine what doses are the safest and most effective for treatment. if you are taking over-the-counter prilosec and it is not effective for the treatment of your symptoms consult your health-care professional about your condition. do not assume that doubling the dose of the over-the-counter medication will have the same coverage as the prescription strength. while these two medications are both made by the same company you should only accept advice from your health-care professional about whether the dose of the over-the-counter medication should be increased.	instead of taking nexium 40 mg could i take prilosec 20 mg twice a day?
diet is not the only factor that increases blood sugar. if you don't have diabetes your blood sugar will be tightly controlled either by increasing insulin to combat high carb intake or utilizing stored forms from the liver and muscles to be put back into the blood stream. so even though you take in little carbohydrates your body will aim to keep levels within a normal range. when the diet remains low in carbohydrates and the stored sources run low the body then turns fat into glucose but this also produces ketones which can have unpleasant side effects. don't forget your brain needs glucose! according to the institute of medicine individuals need 130g of carbohydrate for the brain to run efficiently. i would check with your healthcare provider or registered dietitian for the appropriate diet for your condition. if you have diabetes it's best to see a diabetes educator to help with any changes in diet as medication is also likely to change.	am blood sugar 86 - ate water 4 hamburger patties 1/4 c almonds 1/4 c cashews 1/4 cup plain yogurt next am 99 how? . i have candida and have been monitoring my blood sugar to ensure it doesn't go too high and further my problems. i don't understand how i can go from blood sugar of 86 one morning to 99 the next when i had no more than 31 carbs all day. please help me understand where i'm making my mistake. . water = carb free. 4 hamburger patties = (<1 each). 1/4 cup cashews = 8 carbs. 1/4 cup almonds = 8 carbs. 2 tblsp plain yogurt = 11 carbs in a cup

any woman having sex without any form of contraception is capable of becoming pregnant assuming their male partner has viable sperm (and of course you are ovulating). a small amount of spotting 24 hours after sexual activity in no way means you are pregnant. this spotting could simply be minor trauma to your very sensitive and vascular tissue. if you have been trying to get pregnant wait until you miss your period and take a home pregnancy test. if the spotting does not subside you will need to consult your medical provider.	dpotting after sex. i was ovulating yesterday and hed sex with my husband. during the course of the day i feld slight cramping around my lower abdomen. tonight 24hours later i notice some spotting. its n brownish color. can i be pregnant?

types of prostatitis include: acute bacterial prostatitis. a sudden bacterial infection marked by inflammation of the prostate. this is the least common form of prostatitis but the symptoms are usually severe. patients with this condition have an acute urinary tract infection with increased urinary frequency and urgency need to urinate a lot at night and have pain in the pelvis and genital area. they often have fever chills nausea vomiting and burning when urinating. acute bacterial prostatitis requires prompt treatment as the condition can lead to bladder infections abscesses in the prostate or in extreme cases completely blocked urine flow. left untreated the condition can cause confusion and low blood pressure and may be fatal. the condition is usually treated in the hospital with intravenous antibiotics pain relievers and fluids. chronic bacterial prostatitis. this condition is the result of recurrent urinary tract infections that have entered the prostate gland. it is thought to exist for several years in some men before producing symptoms. the symptoms are similar to acute bacterial prostatitis but are less severe and can fluctuate in intensity. the diagnosis of this condition is often challenging. it's often difficult to find the bacteria in the urine. treatment includes antibiotics for four to 12 weeks and other treatment for pain. sometimes men are given suppressive low-dose long-duration antibiotic therapy. chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. this is the most common form of the disease accounting for 90% of the cases. the condition is marked by urinary and genital pain for at least three of the past six months. patients have no bacteria in their urine but may have other signs of inflammation. the condition can be confused with interstitial cystitis (a chronic inflammation of the bladder).	what are the different types of prostatitis?
i broke my spine at l4 l5 on top of a nerve with cyst. i had surgery and decided to take jobs where i could walk. well you always seem to end up dragging heavy things around which is not good for you. also do not go bowling - that a no-brainer but evidently i do not have one. i find walking is the best and i agree it is boring so. i walk in big stores because it is more interesting. wal-mart is great because it is so big you can keep a good pace. i have a huge herniated disc and nerve room involvement just where i had the spinal fusion surgery. i am in pain right now and the nerve block did not work. i am also a little scared because i do not know what is going to happen next. i went to physical therapy because the insurance required it before my nerve block. they could not work on my back because it was too swollen - but you might benefit you. i have been to other physical therapists and they were not that helpful. i really like this one - results physical therapy. they may be a chain. they will give you exercises (that make sense and help. ) good luck - do not forget to use an ice pack because that helps (i use frozen peas wrapped in a towel. thanks denise	what types of exercise are contraindicated for someone who has had a l5-s1 spinal fusion? screws were removed. my fusion has been complete for several years but i still have chronic pain. excercise can help but i'd like to know what not to do with having my l5-s1 vertebrae fused. also which types of exercise and stretching would be most beneficial? i have tried walking which gets painful for me and bores me to tears. i also am not fond of pilates.

"as you know i have no way of seeing your hand or feet sores but hfm is a possibility although it is rare as an adult (assuming you are an adult). strep can cause desquamation (peeling of the skin) of these areas so it is possible that this process is starting. read about ""scarlet fever"". a person on antibiotics for strep would be better but you would also improve (naturally) if you had a virus like hfm. since you were not tested to know one way or the other the mystery may remain. if your sore progress you will need to see your medical provider again for a visual examination."

this is a tough one because antihistamine use which is typically a product used to treat hives really can't be used in pregnant women. i would ask her how often is she getting the hives and is this related to something along the food allergy so she could avoid certain foods. a lot of people don't realize too when they change detergents they actually can get an allergic reaction and that might cause hives. sometimes pregnant women will figure well i have to go with a different detergent now that i am pregnant. now a lot of times it's that reaction that will cause this. ask if she has been to a doctor dermatologist to see if they are aware of the fact that she is breaking out like this. one of the great products that we have available is an oatmeal bath or aveeno products. that's great to kind of calm down them. but if it seems like it's getting more-and-more common and more severe she needs to go see her doctor to have it checked out even further.	i am pregnant with hives what can i take?
my friend had the same issue. once the doctor tested his testosterone adnd figured it was really low he was given cream to rub onto legs and then later on injections. but he then started growing a mustache and hair on chest which is somethin he didnt have before. low testosterone also makes one feel super low on energy for everyday life and also low sex drive and interest. hope this helps	i am a 22 year old male and i dont have facial hairs. am i normal or am i having low levels of testosterone? . i am 22 i have hairs growing all the other parts of the body like armpits pubic area stomach but don't have hairs on my chest and face and i also have enlarged breasts as i am little overweight. but i don't have any problem with my sex drive or erections. is it due to low levels of testosterone?
the only person that could answer that question would be a fertility specialist who is working with both of you -- someone who knows your husband's sperm count/motility and someone who knows if you are ovulating properly. testosterone may not insure fertility and vitamins will do little to influence your ability as a couple to conceive.	need information. i'm 42 my hubby is 43. he was taking testosterone pill(one under tongue)1 every other day but he also has been taking several vitamin compounds that help with infertility. what are our chances of conceiving naturally? thank you

if you're referring to a crack in the corner of your mouth where the upper and lower lips join you may be suffering from perleche known medically as angular cheilitis. perleche can be caused by a fungal infection in which case you'll need to see a doctor for medication to help it heal. the condition also can be caused by a deficiency of vitamin b so you can try taking a vitamin supplement (assuming you're not allergic to any medications or food colorings) or eating more green leafy vegetables which typically contain plenty of different b vitamins. because of the possibility this is a fungal infection i'd suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider for an evaluation. i wish you all the best!	i have a cut on the corner of my mouth that wont heal. what can i use to help?
so sorry to hear you're dealing with all of that. it can feel overwhelming. i admire your desire to get to the root of the various problems and fix them. that's a great attitude to take. unfortunately there are some health problems for which we can only treat symptoms not the cause. let me explain. congestive heart failure (chf) means your heart is not able to pump as strongly as it once did. as a result your blood cannot carry as much oxygen to the tissues as it used to. this problem causes your symptoms of shortness of breath (sob) edema and possibly the heaviness/pressure in your left chest. unfortunately chf is a chronic disease. there is no cure for the underlying cause. your thyroid disease is treatable with medications. i assume your doctor put you on medication or has outlined some sort of treatment plan for your thyroid disease. this is a case where the underlying cause of your symptoms (weight gain mental fog) can be addressed. i wish you all the best as you address your health issues in a constructive fashion!	diagnosed with thyroid disease mvp chf and told my body is unable to utilize the o2 taken in can you explain? . i am not one to just treat the symptoms i want to get to the cause of the problem and fix it if possible i just don't know where to start metabolic heart or lungs? the chf is stage c symptoms are fatigue sob heaviness/pressure l chest & arm nausea/indigestion mental fog dizziness intolerant to temp insomnia even with the bipap for sleap apnea wt gain 60 lbs edema l ft hand abd face unable to recline dysrhythmias elevated bpat times elevated pulmonary pressure.
well . in 2014 two very important rules change. the most important is that insurance companies will be forbidden by law from denying coverage to americans with pre-existing health conditions. right now insurance companies can lock people out of the market or price people out of the market. that will no longer be allowed come 2014. people will with a pre-existing health condition be able to buy coverage be able to participate in a pool. in order to make sure that that happens and that we have a solvent insurance pool there is an additional feature that says everyone needs to participate. so most people right now have access to employer-based coverage or indeed carry their own coverage or they qualify for a public program. a limited number of people are not in those categories at all and most of those folks don't have the finances to buy insurance coverage on their own so starting in 2014 there will be a personal responsibility provision that says everybody needs to participate. if you are in the exchange and need some financial assistance based on your income that will be available. if you have employer coverage you're covered. if you are purchasing insurance on your own you'll have an opportunity to purchase that coverage in the insurance exchange. if you qualify for public programs you're covered. so we think that the vast majority of people and this has been the case in massachusetts where they have an exchange set up with very similar rules the vast majority of people who don't have insurance really would love to have coverage for themselves and their families they just can't afford it. and those days will be over. if indeed somebody can afford coverage when we get to 2014 and refuses to pay for coverage there is a financial penalty and it's really paying for the health service that that person and their family may well access. what we know is if someone has an automobile accident and is taken to a hospital they're going to get health care. if they have a stroke or if a family member has cancer they will have health care. they just will be shifting those costs onto everyone else onto taxpayers and hospitals and everyone who buys coverage. so there is an employer responsibility piece there is a government responsibility piece and there's an individual responsibility component of the new health care law.	how much will i be fined if i don't get insurance?

natural estrogen is cardioprotective as it increases the level of hdl (high-density lipoprotein) and decreases the level of ldl (low-density lipoprotein). oxidation of ldl cholesterol is believed to be the initiator of atherosclerosis. estradiol and other estrogens are believed to inhibit this process. hormone replacement therapy - hrt rapidly increases the level of c-reactive proteins in the body a marker of inflammation associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. recently two major studies found that hrt in postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer. another study proved that hrt in postmenopausal women increases the risk of cardiac events and thrombosis. hence women should be advised to cease therapy postmenopause. however a detailed analysis showed that the time of initiating hrt postmenopause plays a crucial role. when initiated within five years of menopause in a healthy woman estrogen-based hrt has far more benefits than adverse outcomes. the pros of hrt includes: reduces symptoms of menopause. reduce osteoporosis dementia and colon cancer. improves cardiovascular system. the cons of hrt are: doubles the risk of thromboembolism. doubles the risk of breast cancer. so pros and cons are to be evaluated before initiating hrt in postmenopausal women. for more information consult a cardiologist online --><link>	Hello doctor,I have a question. Estrogen shows cardioprotective effect before menopause. But, it increases the risk of CVS diseases if taken in oral contraceptive pills. And, they say that oral contraceptive pills should be avoided after 40 years because of CVS complications. I am not getting it. If it is cardioprotective, then why cannot it be given after 40 when estrogen levels in the body decrease? Also, I wanted to know, whether these side effects of oral contraceptive pills are dose dependent. Because, normally in young women estrogen is cardioprotective, but if given extra from the outside, it is increased in the body than required and so, it cause complications. Is this true? Please explain.
"a fever is the body's natural way of fighting an infection. a fever does not need to be ""broken"" or even treated especially a low-grade fever like 101. 3. i see children every day with fevers in the 104-105 range. no problems. no brain damage. and no need to really treat them unless you do so clearly for comfort. did you know that cool baths can actually increase the fever? when the thermal sensors on the skin detect that the child is cold the brain will respond and attempt to increase body heat. fever is good and should not be feared. with that said the cause of the fever cannot be determined unless the child has a proper medical examination. a hospital er is really not the best place and you will likely wait. and wait. and wait until you are seen since mildly-ill people go the back of the line. go to an urgent care facility if you want or you can just wait it out. please spend some time and re-educate yourself about the medical benefits of fever in children. i can assure you that it is quite different than what you mother or grandmother taught you to believe."	how do you break a fever on a two year old and when should i take her to the hospital if i cant get it to break. she has had a fever for two days now so far the highest temp being 101. 3°f now its around 100°f and i cant get it to break with meds ive tried a cool bath still nothing she also has a cough with the fever could it be because he two year mollers are coming in idk what to do i never had this problem with my son

the primary cause of toxic shock syndrome is a toxin produced by the bacterium staphylococcus aureus. two conditions are necessary: the bacteria need an environment in which they can grow rapidly and release toxins (such as a tampon saturated with blood menstrual sponge diaphragm or cervical cap that has been left in the vagina for a very long time). then the toxins must have a way of getting into the bloodstream. sliding a tampon into place in the vagina may make microscopic tears in its walls rupturing tiny blood vessels. a superabsorbent tampon -- especially if it's left in place too long or if it is used when the menstrual flow is light -- can dry out the vagina making such tearing even more likely.	what causes toxic shock syndrome?

there are several other reasons to be having nipple discharge besides pregnancy or breastfeeding. some of these can include: 1. elevated prolactin level (hormone that is elevated during breast feeding to make the milk) due to medications--there are medications which can raise the blood prolactin level which then causes milk production. the most common ones are anti-psychotics and other psychiatric meds. sometimes the older blood pressure medications or even very high levels of thc have been implicated. 2. pituitary adenoma--this is a benign growth inside the pituitary gland which stimulates the production of prolactin. the pituitary gland is where prolactin is always made. 3. estrogen--in some women estrogen (e. g. birth control pills) can increase milk production. 4. breast stimulation--if nipple play is a consistent part of sex it can raise prolactin levels just as a nursing baby can. 5. other type of breast discharge being mistaken for breast secretions/milk--this is more often the case if the milk is coming from just one breast or just a couple of ducts in the nipple. you really should see a gyn or your local county family planning clinic. they will do a blood test to measure prolactin level to see if it is elevated. if the problem is on one side only then a breast ultrasound or mammogram depending upon your age can be ordered. if indicated a ductogram may be needed if the discharge if from one duct only. if you are having a lot of milk you should get checked out.	i never breastfed my four children and i know i am not pregnant. so why would my breasts be producing milk?

we spend years worrying about unplanned pregnancy fearing that our contraception efforts might fail; now that we want to get pregnant we worry that that our contraception efforts may have worked too well. could there be long-term effects of contraception that might be keeping us from conceiving? let's review them briefly and put your mind at ease. 1. combined hormonal methods (e. g. birth control pills the patch and the vaginal ring). these methods are all similar and do not have any long term impact on fertility. we expect your periods to have returned to your normal cycle (whatever that means for you) within 3 months of stopping all of these methods. 2. progesterone only methods (the progesterone only pill the 3 month shot the 3 year implant). we also expect these methods to wear off in 3 months. the shot is a little different in that it is 3 months after the next shot is due (since each shot works for 3 months this would be 6 months after the last shot). again no long term impact on fertility 3. intrauterine device (iud). the iuds currently on the market in the us have a wonderful track record with regards to fertility (which has not the case years ago with an iud that is no longer available). although fertility may be present immediately with either of the two iuds currently available it would be reasonable to expect the progesterone based iud to take about 3 months to clear your system as well 4. diaphragms condoms and spermicides. these methods are only effective when you use them so fertility is immediately restored when you do not use them. condoms have the additional benefit of protecting against sexually transmitted diseases as well. so where are the concerns regarding fertility? some of these methods protect wonderfully against pregnancy but offer no protection against sexually transmitted diseases the real villains with respect to fertility. for most women the transition from their birth control method to trying for pregnancy should be fairly smooth. . the methods of birth control generally donot affects the fertility.	could my previous method of birth control affect my fertility?

stage 2 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm hg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm hg or higher. blood pressure is expressed as the systolic blood pressure “over” the diastolic blood pressure. for example normal blood pressure is “120 over 80”. assigning “stages” to blood pressure was the idea of a national committee dedicated to raising awareness and treatment of hypertension. in their system stage 1 is blood pressure that’s high (140-to-159 systolic or 90-to-99 diastolic) but not as high as in stage 2. the higher stage expresses the more serious health risks from untreated severe high blood pressure. however some experts argue that the term “stage” is misleading because it suggests that blood pressure steadily gets worse in stages which is not always the case.	what is stage 2 hypertension? . stage 2 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm hg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm hg or higher. blood pressure is expressed as the systolic blood pressure “over” the diastolic blood pressure. for example normal blood pressure is “120 over 80”.

i don’t think that there is quite enough research yet to justify the claim that red peppers can treat hypertension. the simple answer is that there never is one “super food” that should be emphasized more than any other to treat any health condition. i would suggest looking into the dash diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). the dash diet emphasizes fruits vegetables fat-free or low-fat dairy products whole grain products fish poultry and nuts. it’s also lower in red meat sugars and sodium. this diet has been shown to lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people. a healthy eating plan such as the dash diet along with a consistent cardiovascular exercise routine can be part of an effective treatment and management plan for hypertension. consult with your doctor further and please visit the following website for more information: <link>	is red pepper a good supplement to treat hypertension. i have read that a ingrediant in red pepper is very good at treating hypertension

the first step in controlling hives is to identify the cause if possible. once you have identified the source of the problem try to avoid exposure to it in the future. a mild case of hives often disappears on its own after a few hours. a longer-lasting case should respond to the manufacturer's recommended dosage of an over-the-counter oral antihistamine. if your hives don't disappear in a few days see a doctor. if you develop symptoms of angioedema or anaphylaxis get medical help immediately. for chronic or especially troublesome outbreaks of hives your doctor will probably order a course of prescription antihistamines. treatment with oral corticosteroids will sometimes reduce swelling when antihistamines don't work but they are usually reserved for more severe cases. if you have the subsurface welts of angioedema you may require hospitalization.	what are standard treatments for hives?

so sorry to hear your husband's going through this. nagging rib pain is no fun! yes his symptoms certainly could be caused from leaning on that fence railing while fishing. i hope he reeled in a big one for his trouble! since he's had all the usual heart testing and was told his heart was in good shape i'm going to guess he's got a case of costochondroitis or an injury to the cartilage between his ribs. leaning against a sharp object such as a fence railing could cause a mild tear or irritation of the rib cartilage. rib cartilage will repair itself eventually. unfortunately it may be mighty ouchy until the healing is finished. your husband can take over-the-counter pain relievers such as anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen naproxyn or plain aspirin for the pain. hope this helps!	my husband was leaning on a metal rail and now that part of his chest has been sore for a month. a little over a month a ago he leaned his chest (the part right below left pectoral) on the railing of fence for about a half hour to an hour long while fishing. he has been complaining that that he has constant aching there since he did that. not a sharp pain but just a constant nagging ache. he has since gone to get chest xray ekg bloodwork etc. to rule out his heart and they found nothing. could it be caused by leaning on the rail?

ouch! having both elbows injured at the same time can't be fun! the bottom line is this: if you're concerned about your elbow not feeling better after 6 weeks then there's nothing wrong with going back to the doctor and having it re-examined. if nothing else it will give you peace of mind. it's possible the elbow that wasn't x-rayed sustained a soft tissue injury. these can be very painful and slow to heal. it sounds like you have full range of motion with that elbow which is good. in other words you can bend it fully. that's always a good sign. still when in doubt check it out. you can start with your primary care provider. he or she will take an x-ray if needed and hopefully get you on the path to being pain-free. good luck!	injured elbows 6 wks ago. one xrayed & stitches. both still tender & one not xrayed hurts most. tiny bones protruding mo. both elbows are still sore and the one not xrayed or examined most hurts most. the tiny bone on top and bottom that are visible when bending arm across in front of myself stick out more than my other elbow. should i be concerned after 6 weeks and/or have that elbow looked at again?

many people learn to sleep with a mask mostly used to darken their environment. i am sure that you could modify a sleeping mask to be gently padded in order to keep your eyes closed. make sure to lubricate your eyes in the morning and before you go to sleep since a dry-eye can be very problematic. hi this below could well be your problem the info come from the uk’s daily mail. suffers from nocturnal lagophthalmos a condition which means sufferers are unable to fully close their eyes when they sleep. doctors have describe the condition as a form of facial paralysis which can lead to dry irritated and damaged eyes. sufferers produce fewer tears to wash away debris such as dust and bacteria which can collect in their eyes which leads to blurred vision and can make them more susceptible to infections. it is not always known what causes the condition although infections genetics traumas and strokes can all lead to the problem. solutions include strapping the eye shut by laying an adhesive dressing strip vertically from the upper eyelid to the cheek. eye patches are recommended while eye masks can also be used. do hope this helps you. good luck	how make my eyes stay shut while am sleeping. when i am sleeping my eyes are half way open. what can i do.
where did all the quarter-pounders go? suddenly half-pound hamburgers are all you see on restaurant menus anymore. how is this a good thing? sure you could split the burger with someone but what are the odds that your meal companion is also going to want a burger? the other option is to cut it in half and take the other half home but you aren’t always going to be able to safely deliver the leftovers to your refrigerator within two hours. plus you probably don’t want to eat a hamburger two days in a row. sounds a little nutty but we actually played this out this scenario at the table a few weeks ago when my daughter wanted to order a hamburger in a restaurant that only offered half-pounders. we ended up telling the servers to make a quarter-pounder patty instead for her (still paid for the half pounder though). over the next few weeks we noticed that several other restaurants only offered half-pound burgers as well. i was hoping we were going in the opposite direction and eating smaller burgers not larger ones. share the monster burger and you would still be getting around 400 calories 23 grams of fat and 10 grams of saturated fat. perhaps it’s simply better to look for a more healthful menu option.	why should i be careful ordering a hamburger?

"a tubal ligation procedure (getting your ""tubes tied"") involves cutting and sealing or plugging the fallopian tubes that run from the ovaries to the uterus. this procedure does not affect your ovaries' ability to function and produce hormones and eggs; it merely makes it impossible for an egg and sperm to meet in the tube. therefore a tubal ligation shouldn't affect your menstrual cycle. i'd suggest you consult your gynecologist to find out what's going on with your cycle. take care!"	getting a tubal ligation can it make you stop having a period? i have had one since i got mine done over a year ago.
yes actually that is completely normal for ibs. irritable bowel syndrome (also sometimes called irritable bowel disease) includes an array of different types of bowel problems. in general ibs refers to a condition in which the large intestine (bowel) becomes inflamed and irritated. this can produce symptoms of pain indigestion and changes in stool. the pattern of symptoms for each person with ibs is different. some people tend to experience more constipation with ibs while others experience more diarrhea. but often a person with ibs struggles to cope with a blend of these two extremes. it's not uncommon for ibs to cause constipation one week and diarrhea the next. your husband may find he needs to make dietary changes to help manage his ibs. he may need to find the right amount of fiber that helps soften his stool enough to avoid constipation but not so much it makes the diarrhea worse. ibs is an unpleasant condition and your husband undoubtedly can use all the support you can offer. wishing you well!	husband has been diagnosed w/ibs. it involves diarrhea & sometimes it involves constipation. is this normal?

one of the hardest parts about controlling anxiety is that severe anxiety can actually cause physical symptoms that lead to more anxiety. many of those with anxiety start to worry about their health because the symptoms can be so disabling that it's hard to convince your mind that anxiety could be causing them. this is often the case with vertigo. vertigo itself is not technically an anxiety symptom but dizziness – which is often confused with the idea of vertigo – very much is and it's actually a surprisingly common one. since vertigo is almost exclusively caused by hyperventilation the best way to stop the feeling of having vertigo is to make sure that you're not hyperventilating anymore. often this is easier said than done. in the middle of an anxiety attack it's very hard to re-gain control of your breathing. but there are tricks that make the process easier now the trick here is a nice brown paper bag this you put over you head and re-breath your output works all the time. do hope this helps you. good luck ps try getting your life together that would help cut down your problems.	can stress and anxiety cause vertigo. i took a test and my stress level was diagnosed as 74 percent when i get stressed or anxious i tent to dig in my ears i have been diagnosed with anxiety severe panic disorder and agoraphobia of which i am alone 10 to 12 hours a day 4 to 5 days a week. and lately i have been under an enormous amount of stress the last 3 to 4 weeks financial worries having enough food the anniversary of my moms death and last night i was forced to drive last night can all this cause vertigo?

out of nearly hundred person having sex with hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) positive person hardly less than one may get infected. the chances of acquiring hiv after sexual exposure is less than one percent. i would suggest you to get hiv rt-pcr (real-time polymerase chain reaction) and elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for hiv- 1 and hiv- 2 antibody from two different laboratory. as far as progression of the disease is concerned hiv-rna would be positive. false positive or negative do not occur every time. be positive. revert back with the test results to a hiv aids specialist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,My ex-partner had HIV three years ago when I was along with him. But, he informed me regarding this very recently. He did not make me aware of his condition. We were not careful always. After getting to know, I checked on internet about its signs and symptoms and found that I had all of them three years ago itself. I got a rapid blood test done and it came negative. Got a HIV test done and that result too came negative. I am convinced that my HIV status has progressed. I read about false positive tests and false negative tests. As my HIV tests fall under false negative I am aware that the doctor will not help me. I am much worried and in need of some guidance. Thank you in advance.

"exactly how much exercise is needed to lower cholesterol has been a matter of some debate. in general most public health organizations recommend at a minimum 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise such as walking jogging biking or gardening. but a 2002 study by researchers at duke university medical center found that more intense exercise is actually better than moderate exercise for lowering cholesterol. people who exercised vigorously also raised their levels of hdl -- the ""good"" kind of lipoprotein that helps clear cholesterol from the blood. ""we found it requires a good amount of high intensity exercise to significantly change hdl "" says william kraus md an assistant professor of medicine at duke and lead author on the study. even though moderate exercise was not as effective in reducing ldl -- the ""bad"" cholesterol -- or increasing hdl it did keep cholesterol levels from rising."	how much exercise does it take to lower cholesterol?

there are many seasonal reasons for the increase in the number of cases of otitis media (middle ear infections) but the no. 1 culprit has got to be colds. colds are due to viruses of course and kids are notorious for collecting them. the children that i see in day-care pre-school and the elementary years are usually active members of the “cold of the month club. ” colds are the no. 1 predisposing factor for ear infections. if we could prevent or at least control colds there would certainly be fewer ear infections. for generations researchers have tried to come up with an effective vaccine against colds but since there are over 200 different viruses — viruses that change/mutate — a vaccine is not likely any time soon. there are some good things about colds — really. colds are usually minor and self-limiting in about a week. these little annoying viruses do stimulate the immune system and a stronger immune system can fight off the more serious attacks. so even if we could prevent all colds it may be messing with mother nature and make things worse. like it not colds are here to stay at least for the foreseeable future. the cold and flu season is closely tied to the ear infection season or as i call it snowtitis. as the weather gets colds windows close and people tend to stay inside more. in closed spaces viruses are more likely to spread. if it is raining outside schools do not let the kids out for recess. ventilation in some schools is inadequate and hygiene is often non-existent. the janitorial staff will empty the trash but it would be rare for them to routinely disinfect surfaces. bathrooms may be clean at the start of the school day but tend to look like those outdoor privies in mumbai by lunch time. some children are more ear-infection prone. if one or both parents had lots of ear infections the apple may not fall far from the tree. children who go to day-care or preschool at an early age are more prone to get sick. some of those viruses may set the stage for middle-ear infections. after age six when kids have 50 or so colds under their immunity belt they get considerably fewer middle ear infections. breast-fed children are less likely to get ear infections than children who are bottle-fed and children who are given a bottle of milk to hold at bedtime are also more prone. children who are exposed to cigarette smoke tend to have more ear infections. there have even been studies that show that families who heat with wood stoves or fireplaces in the winter have a higher incidence. smoke of any type is not good for kids. the last risk factor worth mentioning is pacifiers. several european studies have shown these to be an ear-infection risk in children under four. i suspect kids over four are not using them at least i hope they are not. remember that ear pain is not necessarily an ear infection. parents and grandparents have been telling kids for generations to cover their ears when they are outside to prevent ear infections. this practice will not prevent ear infections but can prevent some cold-related ear pain that some (not all) people can experience. the sensory receptors in the ear canal can really fire up from a cold breeze. if you are cold-sensitive wear a hat or ear muffs but don’t think it is going to ward off infections. oh and don’t tell this to your grandma. i don’t want to get any nasty postings. when you are getting out your winter clothing snow shovels windshield ice scrapes be prepared for a few trips to your medical provider. you may want to consider getting a home otoscope to add to your winter supplies.	why do middle ear infections increase in the winter?

severe heartburn and asthma often go hand-in-hand. recent studies show that up to 89% of those with asthma also suffer from severe heartburn known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). gerd generally occurs at night when the sufferer is lying down. normally a valve between the esophagus and stomach prevents stomach acids from backing up into the esophagus. in gerd the valve does not function properly. the stomach acids reflux or back up into the esophagus; if the acid reaches into the throat or airways the irritation and inflammation can trigger an asthma attack. certain clues that suggest reflux as the cause of asthma include the onset of asthma in adulthood no family history of asthma no history of allergies or bronchitis difficult-to-control asthma or coughing while lying down. if your doctor suspects this problem he or she may recommend specific tests to look for it.	can heartburn “trigger” asthma?
with bipolar disorder you alternate between episodes of depression and mania. in between you may return completely to normal or have some remaining symptoms. the extreme mood changes may come on suddenly or appear more slowly. during a manic episode you may be abnormally happy energetic or very irritable for a week or more. initially you may feel incredibly productive or creative. you may feel powerful and seductive and think there is nothing you can't accomplish. but as a manic episode progresses you may behave wildly and irresponsibly spending a lot of money getting involved in dangerous activities and sleeping very little. you may also have a hard time functioning in your job and relationships. after a manic episode you may return to normal or your mood may swing in the opposite direction and you may feel useless hopeless and extremely sad. when you are depressed you may have trouble concentrating remembering and making decisions. you may have changes in your eating and sleeping habits. and you may lose interest in things you have enjoyed in the past. some people become suicidal or harm themselves during episodes of depression. some feel as if they can't move care or think. men tend to have more manic episodes while women have more episodes of depression. 6 initially stress may trigger depression or mania. but as the illness progresses mood swings may not be caused by any specific event. without treatment your bipolar disorder may get worse causing you to move more often between mania and depression. people with bipolar disorder are more likely to have one or more risk factors of cardiovascular disease including obesity high blood pressure and diabetes. 7 your physical health will be watched closely by your doctor. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get bipolar disorder?

most individuals with ocd experience some symptoms of the disorder indefinitely with times of improvement alternating with times of difficulty. treatments include cognitive behavioral psychotherapy behavioral therapies and medications. behavioral therapies for ocd include ritual prevention and exposure therapy. prevention of rituals involves a mental-health professional helping the ocd sufferer to endure longer and longer periods of resisting the urge to engage in compulsive behaviors. exposure therapy is the process by which the individual with ocd is put in touch with situations that tend to increase the ocd sufferer's urge to engage in compulsions then helping him or her resist that urge. cognitive/behavioral therapists help patients change the negative styles of thinking and behaving that are often associated with the anxiety involved with obsessive compulsive disorder. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are the medications that are most commonly used to treat ocd. these medications increase the amount of the neurochemical serotonin in the brain. (remember that brain serotonin levels are thought to be low in ocd. ) as their name implies the ssris work by selectively inhibiting (blocking) serotonin reuptake in the brain. ssris have fewer side effects than clomipramine an older medication that is actually thought to be somewhat more effective in treating ocd. ssris do not cause orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when sitting up or standing) and heart-rhythm disturbances like clomipramine can. therefore ssris are often the first-line treatment for this illness. examples of ssris include fluoxetine (prozac) paroxetine (paxil) sertraline (zoloft) citalopram (celexa) fluvoxamine (luvox) and escitalopram (lexapro). when the improvement that people with ocd experience is not optimal when an ssri is the only medication prescribed the addition of a neuroleptic medication like risperidone (risperdal) olanzapine (zyprexa) or aripiprazole (abilify) can sometimes be helpful. ssris are generally well tolerated and side effects are usually mild. the most common side effects are nausea diarrhea agitation insomnia and headache. however these side effects generally go away within the first month of ssri use. some patients experience sexual side effects such as decreased sexual desire (decreased libido) delayed orgasm or an inability to have an orgasm. some patients experience tremors with ssris. newer often called atypical neuroleptic medications tend to cause fewer side effects than many of the older medications in this class. the most common side effects of atypical neuroleptics include sleepiness dizziness dry mouth and weight gain. sometimes people can be more sensitive to the effects of the sun while taking these medications and therefore should take care to wear adequate sunblock whenever exposed to the sun. less commonly side effects of atypical neuroleptic medications can result in painless although abnormal muscle movements like tremors stiffness and very rarely permanent muscle twitches called tardive dyskinesia. studies on the effectiveness of treatment of ocd in adults have variable results. some indicate that medications response prevention and cbt are equally although only mildly to moderately effective in treating this problem. cognitive behavioral group therapy (cbgt) has also been found to be an effective treatment for ocd. research on treating ocd in children and adolescents suggests that while medications are clearly effective in treating this disorder the improvement that is experienced as a result is quite mild. however clomipramine tends to be more effective than the ssris and the individual ssris tend to be equally effective. as in adults people under 18 years of age tend to improve more significantly when treated with a combination of medication and cbt.	what are the treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd)?

spacers are great tools especially with inhalers lately. many people have had changes in their inhalers. the older inhalers used a different type of gas or what we called a cfc gas. that was actually banned last year due to environmental laws. so inhalers that people would use for their asthma have actually changed and now they’ll see the letters “hfa” after them. there are some differences and one of the biggest ones is the fact that the spray comes out differently. so i’ve had a lot of patients come back telling me that their medication doesn’t work or well the other thing i found out is that they’re not really using their inhaler the right way. they have to retrain themselves. the spacer’s a great opportunity especially for children or older adults who may not have a steady hand and can’t coordinate their breathing the right way. it’s a plastic tube and you put the inhaler on one end and your mouth on the other and when you spray it the medication goes into this chamber and therefore you can breathe in and out and get your breathing down; so therefore the medication travels to where it needs to go. it’s well worth the money. i know sometimes a lot of people don’t wanna purchase it because it’s usually not covered under insurance; but they’re washable and they’re really great and with the kids they come with a little fun mask or little you know cartoons on it to make it seem like you know it’s not this traumatic experience. but they really do benefit in helping people get the right amount of medication.	is a spacer needed to effectively use an inhaler?
nighttime heartburn tends to leave acid in the esophagus longer and therefore may cause more damage than daytime heartburn. nighttime heartburn can also result in chronic insomnia. many people can find relief by: avoiding foods that can lead to heartburn such as alcohol chocolate and spicy or fatty foods. not eating anything for two to three hours before bedtime. chewing gum in the evening to boost saliva. putting blocks under the top of the mattress to elevate the head four to six inches. taking antacids which neutralize the acid in the stomach; h2 receptor antagonists which reduce the production of acid by the stomach; or a proton pump inhibitor.	what can i do for nighttime heartburn?

hi you just need to think back it must be something you have opened using thumbs and forefingers logically these you would open something with could be a chemical fertiliser or something else that's given you this reaction. see your doctor and take it from there. good luck	i have a red rash with red bumps on the backs of my hands mostly clustered around the base of my thumb and forefinger. . i can't think of anything new i've come into contact with that i would be allergic to. a few of the larger bumps are almost look like small scrapes but they're not. they don't particularly hurt or itch. i've had them for about a week. i was sick with a bad cold recently. they don't seem to be spreading but they also don't seem to be getting better. they're contained to my hands as far as i can tell.
the answer really needs to be individual. you need to decide from a personal point of view from a social point of view and a religious point of view what is best for your child. i used to say that if the father’s circumcised from an identity point of view it’s always good for the son to be because when he looks in the shower looking up at dad it’s nice that part a matches part a they bond that way. but the truth is there’s not any absolute clear reason to have to have it. yes better hygiene. yes it’s easier to maintain with cleanliness the risk for penile cancer is lower in circumcised men but that’s extremely rare in this country. if you maintain normal hygiene penile cancer is unheard of. so the benefits are really more social we do know there are some studies that it’s rarer to contract hiv and other illness because the circumcised penis the skin becomes a little bit thicker so it’s a little less likely to be something during sex less chance for infections. the uncircumcised penis again has more risks as far as scarring as you get older where it scars down or you have to have a circumcision or other technique to open it and also concerns over hygiene. but realistically in this day and age if the boy is clean there’s no biological need to have it it’s really more of a personal or religious social.	should i or should i not circumcise my little baby boy?

"tubal ligation is considered a permanent form of birth control. it's highly doubtful you could get pregnant 13 years after having your tubes tied. a more likely culprit in your lack of a period would be the onset of menopause. before jumping to that conclusion however you'd be wise to take a home pregnancy test just to be safe. and then you'd be well advised to take a trip to the gynecologist to find out what's going on for sure. if you are in fact in the beginning stage of menopause (called "" perimenopause "") your gynecologist can advise you about what to expect over the next few years. wishing you all the best!"	if a woman had her tubes tied 13 years ago can she still get pregnant now. i havent had a period in four months.

some people call a transient ischemic attack (tia) a mini- stroke because the symptoms are like those of a stroke but do not last long. a tia happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or reduced often by a blood clot. after a short time blood flows again and the symptoms go away. with a stroke the blood flow stays blocked and the brain has permanent damage. a tia is a warning: it means you are likely to have a stroke in the future. if you think you are having a tia call. early treatment can help prevent a stroke. if you think you have had a tia but your symptoms have gone away you still need to call your doctor right away. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what is a transient ischemic attack (tia)?
"ouch! getting a tat is painful enough without then experiencing a hard lump underneath it. i'd suggest you see a health care provider about this. it's possible the lump is scar tissue formation but it's impossible to tell without a physical exam. granulomas are a known complication of tattooing but these generally are smaller bumps in the skin. if the tattoo ink is placed too deeply in the skin it can cause scar formation. your tattoo also may appear raised. again it's impossible to know what's going on without having a health care provider perform an exam. at the very least getting a professional opinion will help set your mind at ease. hope this helps! something went awry you should see a dermatologist. i am a professional tattoo artist and in all my training i have never heard of this you can't inject that much ink and it doesn't synch up with scar formation or normal infections. most likely an irritant got into your skin via your fresh tattoo could be environmental or from an insect best to have a doctor look! this exact thing happened to me after getting tattooed sleeve on my arm. it happened in the ""ditch:"" (inner elbow area) about 1 month ago. i also couldn't lower my arm due to the tingling pain sensation in the area and now i have these hard bumps. some are getting slightly smaller but i want to know what will happen. will my skin look smooth and normal again in that area?"	i got a tattoo on my forearm and a hard lump formed under my skin. it was painful but not any longer. what is it? . the lump formed 2 days after i got the tattoo and it was painful to the point where i had to keep my arm elevated because if i lowered it i felt a shotting pain up my arm and tingling also. the pain went away after 3 days but the lump is still here after 6 months. what should i do and what is it?
well i'm not going to sugarcoat it. a cystoscopy isn't the most pleasant experience you'll ever have. on the other hand it's not as painful as say a big incision in your abdomen. based on feedback from male friends who have had a cystoscopy i can tell you they describe the discomfort of the procedure as: pinching and pressure. they say it's not so bad they felt they would have preferred sedation especially since the procedure only takes a few minutes. according to my friends the discomfort lasts about an hour or so but there's no pain or burning on urination afterwards. for the urodynamic test you probably will have a urinary (foley) catheter placed and then your bladder will be filled with fluid. in my experience as a nurse many men have told me the sensation of having a catheter placed was quite uncomfortable. those who could relax and focus their attention elsewhere seemed to tolerate the procedure better. and that is my advice to you. as much as possible focus your attention on your breathing. take long slow deep breaths. focus on making your navel (belly button) rise and fall. it may sound wackadoodle but this relaxation technique really does work. also try to hold a mental image in your mind of you walking out of the clinic getting into your car and driving home. this will help remind you the discomfort is only temporary and soon will be over with. i know you'll breeze through these procedures just fine. wishing you well!	have cystocope and urodynamic test tomorrow what should i expect as far as pain? am pretty scared! . have pretty sever bph and am a male age 53 what can i expect?

sinusitis and tonsillitis are not technically contagious. exposing someone else will not necessarily give them you exact same disease. it is the germs (bacteria viruses) that can be contagious but exposure to those germs will not necessarily result in the same or any disease since everyone's immune system is different. viruses are the most common pathogens and most respiratory viruses that cause sinusitis or tonsillitis are thought to be transmittable by close contact for a day before you know you are ill and for 2-3 days later. mono is a virus that can cause tonsillitis and mono is contagious for a longer period of time. again exposure does not imply that someone would get anything else by a simple cold. strep can cause both tonsillitis and sinusitis and this bacteria is contagious as long as you are contagious or until the end of your antibiotic course. strep will not just jump out of your throat or nose onto someone else but sharing drinks kissing sneezing in someone's face can certain expose others. if their immune system is susceptible to strep they can certainly get it. sinusitis and tonsilitis are not contagious diseases. so you may not worry of affecting anybody in your close vicinity.	how long are you contagious to other people when you have sinusitis and tonsilitis?

i have gone through your history. based on your history your erectile dysfunction is due to side effects of fluoxetine. erection problem can be psychological or organic (problem with blood supply of the penis) or drug-induced. cialis (tadalafil) will help if you have any problem with blood supply of the penis which is not the case with you. you should not take fluoxetine with trazodone and cialis. i suggest you try taking trazodone without fluoxetine. if possible consult your psychiatrist and ask him to modify the medicines for you. i think cialis will not help at this stage. for more information consult a urologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I suffer from psychogenic erectile dysfunction, and I take Fluoxetine for depression from the past 11 years. Recently, I took Trazodone for this problem, but I had to wean myself off Fluoxetine completely. I took Trazodone for two weeks, and I started getting full erections, but my depression came back with a vengeance. And I started having dangerous side effects of Trazodone, so I stopped taking it and went back to Fluoxetine. I took Cialis for a week or two, and I was able to get full erections. But this week, again I am not getting full erections, and my mood is very distressing. I was fine for a while after taking 5 mg of Cialis. What should I do? Will Trazodone work for erections while I take Fluoxetine and Cialis? Will it give a boost to get hard erections like before? I just do not understand, everything was fine, but it feels like my brain pattern changes often. I feel very aroused for a while, and then I do not. Can you please give me some advice?

"finding the cause or causes of hives is very clinically difficult. there are no tests that would conclusively determine the specific cause. you can due hundreds of tests and perhaps get a few things that show up positive but that does not prove this is the specific cause. there are no tests for ""rare causes"" unfortunately. of course you and her mother are frustated. who wouldn't be? frustration does not make it any easier in finding a cause so the next best thing to do is just treat her for hives with something that works. and something that she can take every day."

aerobic exercise is great to help expend calories and boost metabolism to promote weight loss. keep in mind however that you can’t “spot reduce” weight loss meaning that you can’t do a certain exercise to target weight loss from a particular part of your body. the surgeon general recommends 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise 5 days per week 60 minutes is even better if your goal is to lose weight. these recommendations are cut in half however if you do vigorous intensity exercise instead of moderate intensity. also be sure to also include strength training into your routine as well. visit this cdc website for more information on exercise recommendations.	is aerobics a good exercise to loose fat in belly?
no diabetic neuropathy typically affects the toes first then gradually affects the foot ankle then shins etc. it has to do with the nerves in the legs being the longest and therefore receiving the greatest cumulative effect of lost nerve conduction caused by chronically elevated blood sugar levels. the sensitivity in the nerve of the tooth usually indicates a dental problem so a dentist is the one to see about it. people with diabetes are at increased risk for dental problems mostly because of the negative effect of chronically elevated blood sugar levels on the immunity. the white blood cell response to oral bacteria is weakened by the high blood sugar and dental infections become more likely.	i am experiencing some sensitivity in the nerve of my tooth. is this common with diabetic neurapathy?

genital herpes is suspected when multiple painful blisters occur in a sexually exposed area. during the initial outbreak fluid from the blisters may be sent to the laboratory to try and culture the virus but cultures only return a positive result in about 50% of those infected. in other words a negative test result from a blister is not as helpful as a positive test result because the test may be a false-negative test. however if a sample of a fluid-filled blister (in the early stage before it dries up and crusts) tests positive for herpes the test result is very reliable. cultures taken during an initial outbreak of the condition are more likely to be positive for the presence of hsv than cultures from subsequent outbreaks. there are also blood tests that can detect antibodies to the herpes viruses that can be useful in some situations. these tests are specific for hsv-1 or hsv-2 and are able to demonstrate that a person has been infected at some point in time with the virus and they may be useful in identifying infection that does not produce characteristic symptoms. however because false-positive results can occur and because the test results are not always clear-cut they are not recommended for routine use in screening low-risk populations for hsv infection. other diagnostic tests such as polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to identify the genetic material of the virus and rapid fluorescent antibody screening tests are used to identify hsv in some laboratories.	how are genital herpes diagnosed?

the most common cause of bad odor coming from the vagina is a condition called bacterial vaginosis also called gardnerella. the odor stems from an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the vagina that causes a strong fishy odor. the odor is worse after intercourse because the ph of the semen causes more of the odor to be released. prescription pills or cream can usually eliminate the bacterial imbalance. in premenopausal women a not uncommon cause of bad odor is a forgotten tampon. removal of the tampon will correct the problem. gentle cleansing of the vulva with clean water is usually sufficient for hygiene. any soap can be irritating to the vulva and in some cases can cause dermatitis skin irritation or rash. in most cases douching is not recommended. a very strong or unusual odor should be evaluated by a clinician. yes; i was taken off of estrogen without a gradual stop- just kind of cold turkey. i had one intercourse experience after a year of being off estrogen and the odor came. my general health care provider could not help me. i found a gynocologist who would see me.

rest relaxation and regularly scheduled pain medicine are the best treatments for most broken ribs. rib fractures usually result from a blow to the chest or back (as in a car accident or a fall). a broken rib can even come from vigorously swinging a golf club or strenuous coughing. broken ribs can be extremely painful. often the pain from a rib fracture is worse when taking a deep breath. severe broken ribs require evaluation and treatment at a hospital; usually these cause so much pain that a person naturally seeks medical attention. the key to recovery from broken ribs is pain control. the pain from a rib fracture results in “respiratory splinting ” or voluntarily reducing the depth of breathing. some experts believe this increases the risk for pneumonia or other lung problems. pain medicines may allow deeper breathing and help someone with a rib fracture get back to normal activities more quickly. pain medicines can include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) like ibuprofen or naproxen but controlling the pain of broken ribs may require stronger opiate pain medicines like hydrocodone or oxycodone. most rib fractures heal completely within six weeks but many patients can return to normal work and leisure activities much sooner than that.	how do i recover from broken ribs? . rest relaxation and regularly scheduled pain medicine are the best treatments for most broken ribs.

the transit time is quite variable in all people. there are no set times. food can remain in the stomach for two hours or so then progressively travel into the intestinal tract where it may process for several hours. or days. in babies the transit time is surprisingly rapid. babies often poop while you are feeding them! in some adults the transit time can be days especially in older people or people prone to constipation. transit time can be influenced by the type of food ingested the volume/size of meal the amount of water/fluids and the amount of fiber/solids. spicy food may be faster than you anticipated. a heavy thanksgiving dinner may bloat you for a day or more. this is a very interesting question. there are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system. to start the type of food matters. some foods are more complex requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them. on the other hand other foods won’t have to go through such a rigorous process and may be digested and metabolized relatively quickly. fiber for example has a decreased intestinal transit time which means that it spends less time in your intestines and may be passed through faster than something else. the answer also could depend on other factors like age ethnicity and gender. you have to consider that people’s digestive systems can be different or work in slightly different ways. did you know that some people have longer intestines than other people? certainly that might influence how long it takes for food to digest. also individuals may have different levels of microbes present in their intestines that can influence how food is digested too. how long it takes food to digest depends on a lot of different factors. dosent it only takes 30 mins?	how long does it take for food to pass through the stomach and small intestine to the large intestine?

yes some women do experience spotting with heavy exercise. this can represent either a less stable lining of the uterus or polyps/fibroids. let's look at both possibilities. an unstable lining of the uterus can arise from hormonal forms of birth control (e. g. pills/patch/ring/shot). it can also happen if the woman has an overly thickened uterine lining. a too-thick lining can develop if the woman is missing ovulations is perimenopausal and/or is very heavy set. classically a too thick lining will also suggest itself if there are erratic or very heavy menstrual periods. the presence of uterine fibroids or polyps of the uterine lining can also make a normal sized lining be easier to have spotting. classically there may be spotting between periods or after intercourse. bottom line if the spotting persists or increases you should see your gyn or local family planning clinic for follow up. there is no overt reason for you to stop your planned running--unless it prompts increased bleeding.	i have always had regular periods. for the past two weeks i have been spotting when i run every day. is this normal?

depression is depression defined by a series of symptoms that involve changes in sleep energy concentration appetite etc. one does not need to have a reason to develop a depression though if there is a particular event that may have precipitated it (e. g. a loss a separation) that may be relevant to the psychotherapy and understanding one's vulnerabilities to depression. not everybody who has a loss or stressful event occur develops a depression so the thinking is that someone either is or isn't biologically vulnerable to developing depression. depression is different from normal grief or sadness. grief or sadness related to an event does not involve disruptions of sleep and appetite or thoughts of suicide. in fact normal grief can become complicated by a depression which in turn can interfere with the resolution of the grief; so in other words depression is a syndrome involving many components and whatever causes it (we don't really know) it should get treated. when the syndrome involves strong physical symptoms (sleep energy concentration not functioning thoughts of suicide) medicines are especially likely to be helpful.

hormones are drugs that can affect the growth of prostate cancer cells. hormone therapy is sometimes used with radiation treatment or surgery to help make sure that all cancer cells are destroyed. chemotherapy is the use of powerful drugs-either injected or taken as pills-to destroy cancer cells. many men decide to have chemotherapy for treatment of late-stage prostate cancer but researchers are studying whether chemotherapy should be used before or after surgery to treat early-stage high-risk prostate cancer. 11 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat prostate cancer?
"baby : your baby is still very small only about 0. 014 inches to 0. 04 inches in length. the embryo probably in about its second week of development has multiplied to about 150 cells. your baby is being nourished by secretions from the uterine lining. layers of cells already are specialized according to functions. the outer layer will become the nervous system skin and hair; the inner layer will be the breathing and digestive organs; and the middle layer will become the skeleton bones cartilage muscles circulatory system kidneys and sex organs. mom-to-be : you're probably expecting your period this week and if it doesn't occur it might be one of the first signs that you're pregnant. you may also notice light spotting as the embryo implants itself in your uterus. you might not feel any different yet but the amniotic cavity which will be filled with fluid and the placenta which will bring oxygen and nutrients to nourish your baby are forming in your uterus. tip for the week : try to eat healthfully which means choosing a variety of foods from the recommended food groups and drinking at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. but you don't really need to ""eat for two.

treatment with antiviral drugs can help people who are bothered by genital herpes outbreaks stay symptom-free longer. these drugs can also reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when they flare up. drug therapy is not a cure but it can make living with the condition easier. there are three major drugs commonly used to treat genital herpes symptoms: acyclovir (zovirax) famciclovir (famvir) and valacyclovir (valtrex). these are all taken in pill form. severe cases may be treated with intravenous (iv) acyclovir. formulas applied to the surface of the skin provide little benefit and doctors don't usually recommend them.	what are the treatment options for genital herpes?

a thorough physical exam and a series of tests may be required to diagnose crohn's disease. blood tests may be done to check for anemia which could indicate bleeding in the intestines. blood tests may also uncover a high white blood cell count which is a sign of inflammation somewhere in the body. by testing a stool sample the doctor can tell if there is bleeding or infection in the intestines. the doctor may do an upper gastrointestinal (gi) series to look at the small intestine. for this test the patient drinks barium a chalky solution that coats the lining of the small intestine before x rays are taken. the barium shows up white on x-ray film revealing inflammation or other abnormalities in the intestine. the doctor may also do a colonoscopy. for this test the doctor inserts an endoscope-a long flexible lighted tube linked to a computer and tv monitor-into the anus to see the inside of the large intestine. the doctor will be able to see any inflammation or bleeding. during the exam the doctor may do a biopsy which involves taking a sample of tissue from the lining of the intestine to view with a microscope. if these tests show crohn's disease more x rays of both the upper and lower digestive tract may be necessary to see how much is affected by the disease.	how is crohn's disease diagnosed?

"the flu (influenza) viruses influenza viruses cause the flu and are divided into three types designated a b and c. influenza types a and b are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates of hospitalization and death. influenza type c differs from types a and b in some important ways. type c infection usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public-health impact of influenza types a and b. efforts to control the impact of influenza are aimed at types a and b and the remainder of this discussion will be devoted only to these two types. influenza viruses continually change over time usually by mutation (change in the viral rna). this constant changing often enables the virus to evade the immune system of the host (humans birds and other animals) so that the host is susceptible to changing influenza virus infections throughout life. this process works as follows: a host infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the virus changes the ""first"" antibody no longer recognizes the ""newer"" virus and infection can occur because the host does not recognize the new flu virus as a problem until the infection is well under way. the first antibody developed may in some instances provide partial protection against infection with a new influenza virus. in 2009 almost all individuals had no antibodies that could recognize the novel h1n1 virus immediately. type a viruses are divided into types based on differences in two viral surface proteins called the hemagglutinin (h) and the neuraminidase (n). there are at least 16 known h subtypes and nine known n subtypes. these surface proteins can occur in many combinations. when spread by droplets or direct contact the virus if not killed by the host's immune system replicates in the respiratory tract and damages host cells. in people who are immune compromised (for example pregnant individuals infants cancer patients asthma patients people with pulmonary disease and many others) the virus can cause viral pneumonia or stress the individual's system to make them more susceptible to bacterial infections especially bacterial pneumonia. both pneumonia types viral and bacterial can cause severe disease and sometimes death. antigenic shift and drift influenza type a viruses undergo two kinds of changes. one is a series of mutations that occurs over time and causes a gradual evolution of the virus. this is called antigenic ""drift. "" the other kind of change is an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin and/or the neuraminidase proteins. this is called antigenic ""shift. "" in this case a new subtype of the virus suddenly emerges. type a viruses undergo both kinds of changes; influenza type b viruses change only by the more gradual process of antigenic drift and therefore do not cause pandemics. a diagram that illustrates both antigenic shift and drift can be found at <link> and shows how both mechanisms can lead to antigenically diverse virus strains. the 2009 pandemic-causing h1n1 virus is a classic example of antigenic shift. the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has indicated that novel h1n1 swine flu has an rna genome that contains five rna strands derived from various swine flu strains two rna strands from bird flu strains and only one rna strand from human flu strains. they suggest mainly antigenic shifts over about 20 years have led to the development of novel h1n1 flu virus."	what are the causes of the flu?

ivf is the most common type of art and there are other variations on the basic procedure some of which remain controversial. people should learn about both the benefits and risks of any medical procedure. intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi): a single sperm is injected into an egg. if the egg is fertilized and develops normally it is then transferred to the uterus. this has been a significant advance in treating men with low sperm count or disorders related to sperm movement. couples who undergo the procedure should be aware that if their infertility is caused by a genetic defect that defect could be passed to the child. pre-implantation genetic diagnosis: an individual cell from a growing embryo is removed and used for genetic screening during ivf. blastocystculture: a blastocyst a developed embryo is cultured and transferred to the uterus after five or six days compared with the three days for typical in vitro fertilization. cryopreservation: human eggs and embryos are frozen so that they can be kept viable. they are stored in liquid nitrogen at 320 degrees below zero. assisted hatching: an opening is created in the egg shell surrounding the embryo to help it implant in the uterus. this procedure has not been shown to be beneficial for everyone undergoing art. those who may benefit from assisted hatching include couples who have preserved embryos their own or donated by cryopreservation couples in which the mother is of an advanced age or couples with a history of multiple failed ivf attempts. the fda does not regulate individual art procedures but the agency has cleared devices for use in art procedures. examples are biopsy devices dissection needles sperm and embryo delivery catheters and solutions used to process and maintain sperm eggs and embryos.	what other assisted reproductive technologies (art) are used to treat infertility?

i understand your symptoms and your question. it may be peripheral neuropathy. i would like to know your age and whether you have diabetes. if you have any back pain radiating to the legs then it can be a spinal problem. i suppose you do not have back pain. the second possibility is hypothyroidism in which there can be such symptoms. if not checked then you need to check thyroid profile. you should get ssep (somatosensory evoked potential) and ncv (nerve conduction velocity) studies of both lower limbs. we will know the function of the nerves in the lower limb. you can get it done at any electrophysiology laboratory. you should get free t4 and tsh done (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to rule out thyroid problem. i suppose you would have done b12 levels before starting the injections. regarding medicines the dose that you are taking now is not adequate. i would suggest you tablet trigabantin 300 mg (gabapentin) twice a day after food and tablet pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. you may feel little giddiness after these medicines but that will settle in three to four days time. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I have been suffering with tingling and needling sensation in my feet from the last one and a half year.

with the conversation i understand that you are a 33 year old male suffering from cough especially during the months of september and october through the years. therefore it is clear that you are suffering from allergic bronchitis. it is considered to be seasonal. this cough exacerbates in specific months like september and october in your case. during such exacerbation it is advisable to take a steroid bronchodilator and an antibiotic. in your case decadron (dexamethasone) is the steroid proair hfa aerosol (albuterol) is the bronchodilator and zithromax z-pak (azithromycin) is the antibiotic. accordingly antibiotic should be prescribed only if infection is present and if there is yellow or green colored sputum production fever and chest congestion. bronchodilator in the form of aerosol spray helps to relieve bronchospasm and to get rid of any inflammation associated with it. i would suggest you to continue with the aerosol spray as prescribed by your doctor. check for few days. if the symptoms of cough recur then start the antibiotics. when the allergic bronchitis exacerbates you can use proair inhaler and seroflo inhaler (combination of fluticasone and salmeterol) or budecort (budesonide) inhaler together. the two inhalers have a specific way of usage. you can check it with your physician. for further information consult an allergy specialist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,For the past three years, I have been suffering from allergic cough.

a typical pregnancy is nine months long but to give your baby a healthy start think of it as twelve months -- including the three months before you get pregnant. this means that when you start thinking about trying to conceive you should: see your doctor for a prepregnancy checkup. don't forget to ask about things like family medical history risk of birth defects genetic conditions and chronic illnesses. discuss all the medications you take and make sure they're safe during pregnancy. in addition to eating a healthy diet (lots of leafy greens lean proteins and fiber) boost your nutrients with a prenatal vitamin. it's particularly important to get sufficient folic acid before getting pregnant. this nutrient helps prevent birth defects like spina bifida. look for a multivitamin that contains 400 micrograms of calcium. if you smoke quit. smoking poses a host of risks to a developing baby including birth defects and low birth weight. it also doubles your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy. get checked for hepatitis b and c sexually transmitted infections and hiv. get any health problems -- like diabetes and high blood pressure -- under control. if you are seriously overweight talk to your doctor about how to maintain a healthy weight.	what should i do before i get pregnant to ensure a healthy pregnancy for me and my baby?
you are engaging in some very very risky behavior by having any sexual contact with a prostitute. since you do not know the hiv or other std status of this woman it would be wise to curtail this activity in the future. while it would be unlikely to contact hiv in this manner you may need to be tested for your own peace of mind. if a condom breaks during oral sex you would be susceptable to any oral disease this person may have some of which may be sexually transmitted.	can you contract hiv from fingering a girl who is? . i recently fingered a prostitute and she took it out bc she said she's afraid there are germs. hence my fear of her being hiv positive! after that i played with her clitoris and it was wet. . can i contract hiv that way? i did not see any broken skin on my fingers but could it still be possible? also after i touched her i may have touched other parts of her body in which my mouth may have touched too. can i contract hiv that way too? . lastly what happens if a condom breaks during oral sex?
there is a drug interaction between gabapentin and hydrocodone in which when taken together the bioavailability of hydrocodone is reduced by as much as 22% but the bioavailability of gabapentin is increased by as much as15%. to avoid this interaction since you already seem to be having side effects from the gabapentin you should take the hydrocodone at least an hour before you take the gabapentin. this will allow you the pain killing effects while avoiding a major interaction. i'm not a nurse but the other answer from the nurse was incorrect in this case. when in doubt try several drug interaction checkers. they're all over the web. cheers.	how long after you take a gabapentin 300mg tablet should you take a lortab 7. 5mg? . i take gabapentin 300mg 3x a day and when i have serious pain i take the lortab 7. 5mg i usually wait about an hour after i take the gabapentin and then i take the lortab i did that this evening and for some reason i'm having unusual nausea and shakiness in my upper extremities. could you please tell me how long i should wait before i take the lortab? and what can i do to stop the shakiness?

now don't tell you mother or grandmother but the answer is no. going from a warm work-out area to the cold air is not going to cause illness so you can stop worrying about being sued. it is an old and medically-disproven belief that cold air drafts or chills lead to illness. if that were true think of all the aleuts laplanders and siberians. you would think they would be sick all of the time. as a matter of fact many are healthier. the finish and swedes even bake themselves in a sauna and then run out and roll in the snow or jump in an ice lake. crazy? maybe but the practice is harmless. they feel that it is is healthy. maybe they are correct. as a wrestling coach your contaminated mats are much more of a health hazard so before those boys head for the locker room make them disinfect those mats and make them take their work-out clothes home to be properly washed.	can athletes get sick going outside immediately after working out? . i coach a college wrestling team. two days a week the athletes are not permitted to walk from the practice room thru the weight room and into the locker room instead they have to walk outside and around to a side door and then walk into the building then finally to the locker room. is this a health risk? i dont want to be sued for putting my athletes at risk but i would need medical documentation to prove this is hazardous to the college.

the affordable care act is not socialized medicine. people will continue to buy insurance policies from private in many cases for-profit insurance companies -- not the government. the law puts in place new regulations on how insurers must operate but the government has no role in authorizing care. if you have private insurance now you'll continue with similar coverage. the advantage for someone like you with chronic illnesses is that no longer will insurers be allowed to cancel your policy deny you insurance or charge you more for coverage because you're sick. like always authorization for specific medical procedures will be dictated by the rules of your health plan.	i have type 2 diabetes and have been seeing a doctor for treatment. . how is socialized medicine going to affect my prescriptions and tests that i have done at least twice a year? i also need another knee replacement possibly at the end of next year. what type of authorization from the federal insurance plans will everyone need over the age of 60?

"i have no way of determining over the internet based solely on your symptoms if you have a cold or ""something else"". this requires a hands-on medical examination and a more thorough medical history. antibiotics have absolutely no effect on colds which are viral. unless you have a secondary bacterial infection (bacterial sinusitis bacterial pneumonia etc. ) antibiotics are not needed or helpful. people with asthma are more prone to secondary infections and since there are over 200 different viral strains known to cause colds once can certainly get back-to-back different viral infections all having a similar array of symptoms. this often happens during the fall-winter months -- the cold season."	i have had a cold for the last 3 weeks is it really a cold or is it something else? . cough (varies from non productive to productive). nasal congestion. headache. i have already been on antibiotics. i do have asthma.

keep in mind that your blood pressure can vary naturally throughout the course of a day. exercise or physical activity has a tendency to raise blood pressure so refrain from taking a reading afterwards. stress can influence blood pressure too. in fact white coat hypertension is a phenomenon where the anxiety of visiting with a doctor can raise blood pressure where it wouldn’t be elevated otherwise. make sure that you are measuring your blood pressure on a regular basis and at the same time of day controlling for as many confounding variables as possible. for these reasons measuring your blood pressure first thing in the morning works well for some people. also because your blood pressure can vary it’s important to obtain many readings to observe a trend or pattern. the best way to check your blood pressure is manually through trained medical personnel. the accuracy of automated electronic blood pressure machines can vary depending on the quality of the device. some machines may need occasional calibration or maintenance too. to determine the accuracy of your home device take it with you the next time you go to the doctor and have a trained medical person measure your blood pressure manually and then compare it with your device. it is normal for blood pressure to change nearly every time you take it regardless of the time of day. the most important reading would then be the average reading so just take your bp a few times a day and write it down. as long as your average blood pressures are in the normal range minor daily fluctuations are usually not that important. my moms blood pressure is 56 over 40 what	what's best of day to check your blood pressure. my pressure changes all the time when i check it at different times. i'm 74 and a active person. thomas

that would depend on many factors especially the location of this fluid. if the fluid was in your ear canal the fluid can be aspirated or vacuumed out. if the fluid is in your middle ear space the area on the other side of your eardrum then this fluid usually does not drain per se but is reabsorbed over time. some fluid can drain down the eustachian tubes but most will just reabsorb over time. some medical providers will use nasal steroid sprays or even decongestants to help but studies have shown that they may or may not help. surgically fluid can be trained by inserting tubes - pressure equalization tubes.	how to drain fluid from my ears

i'm sorry you're dealing with this. skin rashes can be painful and annoying. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose what this might be without performing a physical examination. from what you're describing this sounds like some type of dermatitis. i doubt it's warts because they usually are not painful or scaly. fortunately many types of dermatitis can be treated with a prescription cream that will heal up the scaly patch of skin. once it heals up the pain should go away. i'd recommend you make an appointment with your primary care provider or a dermatologist the next time this flares up. that way you'll get an accurate diagnosis. best wishes to you!	i have a sore patch of skin thats scaley bumpy and peels i have had it for months and have no idea what it is. this atch of skin is on the outter art of my palm towards my wrist i have had it for months probably close to a year now i have not treated it with anything. it's dry and and sore and has bumps sometimes it will be healed and not be dry or sore however the bumps are small and always there. when it gets really dry it peels and then typically heals and does not bother me for awhile. i have no i dea what it is but the small bumps almost seem like tiny planter warts.

the medical professional administering the injection draws up the corticosteroid into a syringe. a local anesthetic (such as lidocaine) may simultaneously be drawn into the syringe. next the area to be injected is selected. typically the skin over the area to be injected is sterilized with a liquid solution either alcohol or betadine. sometimes the area is topically anesthetized by rapid cooling using a spray such as ethyl chloride. the needle of the syringe then is inserted into the tissue to be injected and the solution is ejected from the syringe into the area of inflammation. the needle then is withdrawn and a sterile bandage is applied to the injection site.	how are cortisone injections of soft tissues given?
most helpful answer symptoms of poison ivy reactions to the skin in dogs can include raised bumps or swelling of the skin. the dog may become very itchy and the skin may also become inflamed. i'm a little late to the game but yes dogs can get poison ivy with a similar reaction that humans get. and don't forget that the dog can pass the oil to you and then you can get poison ivy if you're sensitive to it. if your dog has been in an area that you know has poison ivy or off in the woods where there is likely to be poison ivy you should wash their coat immediately and be sure not to touch the dog yourself until all the oil from the poison ivy plant is washed off. dogs definitely can get poison ivy it's just pretty rare. it's because it has to get past their fur or be ingested to even come in contact with the dog in a way that could affect them. most of the time pets can recive poison ivy just don't pet them until its gone if they are itchy it's probably fleas. imo they cannot get poison ivy.	can a dog get poison ivy?

bph (benign prostatic hyperplasia) is an enlargement of the prostate gland. this gland surrounds the tube that drains the urine from the bladder. the symptoms of bph can be caused by a tensing of the enlarged muscle in the prostate gland which blocks the passage of urine. this can lead to such symptoms as: a weak or start-and-stop stream when urinating a feeling that the bladder is not completely emptied after urination a delay or difficulty in the beginning of urination a need to urinate often during the day and especially at night a feeling that you must urinate immediately.	what is bph?
"in a new study published in radiology german researchers have proclaimed that they can use mri and mr spectroscopy imaging to actually predict who will benefit most from lifestyle changes. the answer involves how much intra-abdominal and liver fat you have. the scientists performed mri scans on 243 (99 men mean age 47 years and 144 women mean age 44 years) before and after nine months of a healthy lifestyle-intervention program with a goal of shedding 5 percent of original body weight. the participants reduced their fat intake to no more than 30 percent of total calories and walked at least three hours per week while generally engaging in moderate physical activity each day. all of the study subjects were considered at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. they had a bmi of 27 or greater impaired glucose tolerance and/or a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. in addition to the mri scans researchers also measured insulin sensitivity since people who have type 2 diabetes don’t respond appropriately to insulin (a hormone secreted by the pancreas that is crucial to glucose metabolism). after nine months in the healthier lifestyle program scientists found that: * 71% of the men and 58% of the women experienced improved insulin sensitivity and along with this they shed lots of intra-abdominal fat (19% reduced in women 20% in men) and liver fat (35% reduced in women 44% in men) while the overall body weight decreased by 3-5%. * the study subjects who fared the best with shedding fat started out with lower baseline levels of intra-abdominal and liver fat. * participants who did not experience an improvement in insulin sensitivity dropped much smaller amounts of intra-abdominal fat (4% reduced in women 6% in men) while men shed 15% of their liver fat and women actually gained 22% more liver fat. here are some take-home messages to help guide you on your quest to live your best healthy lifestyle: 1. it’s not just how fat you are but it’s where the fat is at that counts. fat that is carried primarily on the lower half of the body (hips thighs buttocks) is metabolically different than intra-abdominal and liver fat. excessive inner belly fat is highly associated with a higher risk of heart disease type 2 diabetes and some cancers. it is also associated with an increased level of inflammation which is often a precursor to these medical conditions. 2. mind your middle. grab a tape measure right now and whip it around your tummy across your belly button. your goal is to keep your waist size under 35"" for women and below 40"" if you’re a guy. want to know if you’ve got too much inner belly fat? first look in the mirror. if you’re more apple shaped (versus pear shape) you may have too much intra-abdominal fat. second lay down on your back on a flat surface. intra-abdominal fat doesn’t move since it’s wedged underneath your abdominal muscle. simply look down and if your belly is protruding like you’re pregnant (this includes you guys) then you have excessive inner belly fat. if you have a normal amount of inner belly fat you should be pretty flat across your pelvic bones. 3. practice girth control. clearly the best way to manage your intra-abdominal fat is to prevent weight gain in the first place. it becomes much easier to pack on the pounds inside your abdomen after the age of 40. if you’ve already accumulated fat inside your abdomen here’s how to get rid of it: * consistent intense exercise: combine daily 30 or more minutes accrued of aerobic activity with intervals of intensity along with weight lifting 2 x week. you need both. the aerobic activity with intensity intervals will prompt intra-abdominal fat cells to release their fat fuel and decrease the fat load. the weight lifting increases your ability to burn calories faster and more efficiently. * strategic nutrition: most americans consume between 400-600 grams of carbs daily mostly processed junk. try to limit your carbs to no more than about 200 grams per day. eliminate junk carbs (processed foods white carbs — white bread pasta rice potato) and prioritize whole foods such as veggies watery fruits and whole grains along with lean protein sources. control your portions keeping your total daily caloric intake appropriate for either weight reduction or maintenance. 4. people are different. this study does underscore the fact that people are indeed very different. we have unique family histories medical experiences body shapes and fat distributions."	why do some people lose weight faster than others?

getting your tubes tied (also called tubal ligation ) is considered a permanent form of birth control. so it's unlikely you're pregnant. if the pain is severe you certainly should seek medical attention to determine the cause. several conditions can cause the type of pain you're describing so an accurate diagnosis is important. once the cause of the pain is determined your health care provider can provide you with treatment options. i usually recommend people first try to get an appointment with their primary care provider. however if you can't get in to see your regular health care provider -- or if you begin experiencing other symptoms such as a fever nausea or vomiting -- then by all means head for the er. best wishes to you!	i had my tubes tied 6 years ago but i have been expriencing serious pain in my lower left side could i be pregnant? . my menstrual ended on 10-23-12 i've been having intercourse every day and today which is the 28th the pain started should i go to the emergency room?
anything that is hitting the two+ year mark in your pantry you should probably think about tossing. over time spices lose their flavor. if you continue to use old spices you are essentially putting colored dust into your food. buy as much of your spices in the bulk section of your local market or natural food store as you can. you will pay so much less and you can buy the small amounts of what you need. instead of paying $7. 00 for a jar of turmeric you may pay $0. 20 for the 2 tablespoons you will actually utilize this year. there are a few items that last longer than others. whole nutmegs whole cinnamon whole peppercorns or other whole items can last up to a year longer than their already ground counterparts.	how long is the shelf life for kitchen spices?

"my best answer is: you should not discontinue simvastatin without consulting your physician. a stress test alone cannot tell you there is ""no build up"" of plaque in your arteries. i'm glad your stress test result was good but your total cholesterol number is a bit high. it's not outrageous though and that fact warrants a discussion with your physician. if your health care provider feels you need to be on a cholesterol-lowering drug there are many alternatives to simvastatin. your provider can advise you how to discontinue the simvastatin and start a new medication if needed. you might also check out webmd's heart disease community to see how others have handled their borderline high cholesterol issues what medications they take and how they talked to their doctor about their choices of cholesterol-lowering drugs. take care! i would ween myself off of the medicine and cut the pill in half and take half for a week. the next week i would take half of a half then take half of a half every other day for a week. the fourth week i would discontinue altogether. i would tell my doctor if or when i had a visit. i think w/this drug you could probably just stop taking it all together but of course i am not a doctor. it's not like a blood pressure medicine though. i had horrible side effects (ttp bruising platelets dramatically dropped muscles hurt brain fog tired) from this drug. i will never take a statin again. i believe there are other more natural things out there that will work. my cholestrol was 225 when i was put on it. good luck! i applaud your attitude to this dangerous drug. i would suggest you do a lot of research on the subject. dr. duane graveline's book 'lipitor thief of memory' is a good start: www. spacedoc. com there are a lot of links to other doctors surgeons and researchers who are skeptical of statins. i went through all the test in the hospital. i was told i had a heart of a 27 year old. my doctor did not believe the test as he could not control my blood pressure. they went in and found a blockage--widow maker. they did a stent. surgeon stated i would have been dead within 30 days. so much for test. you can try red yeast rice and naicin. naicin taken twice a day can lower according to my doctor. i take both and my readings are 90/72. try it capsules do not cost very much. these books i have found to be very resourceful. the statin damage crisis/ by duane graveline m. d. the great cholestrol myth by jonny bowden ph. c. n. s. and how statin drugs really lower cholesterol james b. yoseph and hannah yoseph md. i urge you to do your research carefully."	how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. .

"well your best bet honestly is to contact your surgeon's office and ask them directly. they can look the information up in your chart. but i can tell you that ""bladder sling"" is a term normally used regarding bladder suspension surgery in women with prolapsed bladders. a bladder sling restores the urinary bladder to its correct position within the pelvic cavity. (men with urinary incontinence after prostatectomy may also have bladder sling surgery. ) in lumbar fusion surgery the approach normally is from the back. (did you lie face-down for your surgery? ) the abdominal cavity is never entered so the positioning of your bladder is of no consequence. you likely did have a foley catheter inserted to drain your bladder for your comfort during surgery but this probably was removed before you even woke up from surgery. i hope this helps!"	is a bladder sling used for lumbar fusion surgery? . i think i remember my surgeon saying he used a sling to keep it out of the way when working on the cage? damn drugs. my mind was a haze.

technically yes. herpes simplex is directly contagious and can occur on the buttocks itself so if you used a toilet relatively soon after another person who had active herpes simplex on their buttocks you can end up getting exposed on your buttocks. the herpes virus can remain viable on certain surfaces for hours so it is biologically possible. if you are female and have herpes on your genital/vaginal area it is not likely this part touched the toilet seat so the source was mostly likely direct contact with another person who has herpes.	can you get herpes simplex 2 from a contaminated toilet seat?
since you are in treatment with both a psychiatrist and a psychologist and you have tried as you said many medications without sufficient help. you also indicated that you have serious agoraphobia which keeps you in your home. what is the treatment plan to handle your agoraphobia? i think this needs to be discussed especially with your psychologist who would seem the one with special expertise in this area. you might also consider getting a second opinion from another psychologist who might have more of a behavioral orientation which would help you take small steps toward leaving your home. i understand that this could be difficult to do but you really need someone who can offer you a treatment plan to properly address your primary symptom which appears to be the agoraphobia.	i am extremely agoraphobic despite help from my psychologist psychiatrist and medication. why else can i do?

the fatigue you feel from having cancer and receiving radiation therapy can be overwhelming and keep you from doing the things you normally do such as going to work or spending time with family and friends. it's also unpredictable and can seem different from day to day which makes it hard to plan around it. it can even interfere with how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. sometimes doctors can discover other causes for the fatigue. when they do the cause can be treated. there are things you can do to make fatigue less disabling: take care of your health. the level of fatigue you feel is often related to the condition of your health at the time of treatment. review with your doctor how well you are following your treatment plan not just for cancer but for other health conditions you may have. be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. get plenty of rest increase your level of physical activity and continue to eat a nutritious diet with plenty of protein. work with a counselor or take a class offered at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy reduce stress and use distraction to not focus on the fatigue. prioritize your regular activities so you can do the ones that are most important to you first when you feel less fatigued. maintain a balance between rest and activities. too much bed rest can make you more fatigued. but don't over-schedule your activities without allowing time to rest. talk with your family and friends and ask for their help. if fatigue is interfering with your job discuss your situation with your employer and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. keep in mind that the fatigue related to radiation therapy will most likely be temporary and will pass several weeks after your radiation treatment ends.	what can i do about fatigue that results from radiation therapy?

hepatitis c infection is the leading reason for liver transplantation in the u. s. accounting for 40% to 45% of transplants. hcv routinely recurs after transplantation and infects the new liver. approximately 25% of these patients with recurrent hepatitis will develop cirrhosis within five years of transplantation. despite these findings of recurrence the five-year survival rate for patients with hcv is comparable to that of patients who receive transplants for other types of liver disease. treatment for recurrent hepatitis is not a simple issue. interferon is an immune modulator (modifier) that may promote rejection of the transplanted liver. furthermore interferon may not be well tolerated by patients who just underwent transplantation and are taking many different kinds of medications.	can liver transplantation be done for hepatitis c?

it sounds like there may be some abnormal sensitivity to cold. this can be a reversible situation that responds well to desensitizing toothpastes like sensodyne or prescription-strength fluoride treatments done at home. however it may also be an irreversible pulpitis situation in one or more of the teeth that could require root canal. either way your dentist needs to check out the problem and may need to take x-rays to be sure! bottom line: make an appointment to see the dentist.	after eating ice cream i have been having pain in my back molars when something cold touches them. what could be wrong?
"hyperthyroidism is a condition in which an overactive thyroid gland is producing an excessive amount of thyroid hormones that circulate in the blood (""hyper"" means ""over"" in greek). thyrotoxicosis is a toxic condition that is caused by an excess of thyroid hormones from any cause. thyrotoxicosis can be caused by an excessive intake of thyroid hormone or by overproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland."	what is hyperthyroidism?
hives are produced when histamine and other compounds are released from cells called mast cells which are normally found in the skin. histamine causes fluid to leak from the local blood vessels leading to swelling in the skin. hives are very common. although they can be annoying they usually resolve on their own over a period of weeks and are rarely medically serious. some hives are caused by allergies to such things as foods medications and insect stings but in the majority of cases no specific cause for them is ever found. although patients may find it frustrating not to know what has caused their hives maneuvers like changing diet soap detergent and makeup are hardly ever helpful in preventing hives and are not necessary for the most part. having hives may cause stress but stress by itself does not cause hives. in rare cases (some hereditary others caused by bee stings or drug allergy) urticaria and angioedema are accompanied by a striking decrease in blood pressure (shock) and difficulty breathing. this is called anaphylaxis. ordinary hives may be widespread and disturbing to look at but the vast majority of cases of hives do not lead to life-threatening complications.	what causes hives?

"congratulations! aao means you were ""alert and oriented"" when examined. the ""x3"" means ""times 3 "" which indicates you were alert and oriented to ""person place and time. "" we frequently use the aao designation when assessing a patient's mental status such as after a possible head injury. if you've ever had a health care professional ask you the questions ""what is your name? "" ""do you know where you are? "" or ""what day is it? "" then you were being screened using the aao technique. i hope this helps! it probably means ""alert and oriented x 3"". the ""3"" is time place and person. it means that 1. you know what time or date it is 2. you know where you are and 3. you know who you are. don't you hate when medical providers use abbreviations? it used to be worse. they used to use latin! aaox3 means that the person is a=alert a=awake o=oriented x3= to place (you know where you are) person (you know who you are) time (you know what date it is or day whatever the health care provider asks you) in ems we use aaox4 which also adds event (you know what happened) for instance if you were in a mov (motor vehicle accident) do you know how it happen were you awake at all times or did you blacked out and don't remember what happen. that usually can mean that the person sustained some trauma to the head or the person could of passed out and that caused the accident. anyways hope this helped."	an indian internist used the letters aaox3 and then went on to say what aao stands for. i couldn't understand an idea? . he read from a chart: cvs or cns aaox3
hi masturbating with a sex toy would not be classed as having sexual intercourse it would be best if you go get checked out though or try using some coconut oil(extra virgin) is best and good at helping to clear up what could be a yeast infection that does not want to leave you. but also try these for help. <link> <link> <link> <link> <link> also google sea salt and the vagina. vaginal itching natural cures includes sea salt fungi live in air in soil on plants and in water. some live in the human body. only about half of all types of fungi are harmful. some fungi reproduce through tiny spores in the air. you can inhale the spores or they can land on you. as a result fungal infections often start in the lungs or on the skin. you are more likely to get a fungal infection if you have a weakened immune system or take antibiotics. fungi can be difficult to kill. for skin and nail infections you can apply medicine directly to the infected area. oral antifungal medicines are also available for serious infections. so you can get a yeast infection from many sources and also remember we do carry many yeasts around on our body's as we need them. do hope this helps you. good luck	tampon pain/irritation. i am a 20 year old woman who just recently had penetrative sex for the first time. it was with a toy but it was washed before and after. i noticed itching in my vagina a few days after the sex. i was on my period however and using pads. when the pads stopped so did the itching. it's been about 5 months and i have been unable to use tampons comfortably since. they either itch burn or i can tell that they are in. . is it possible that this is related to my sexual intercourse?
most helpful answer the flu (influenza) and the common cold are caused by different viruses. the flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. the common cold is often caused by rhinovirus infection although a number of other viruses also can cause cold-like symptoms. influenza and the common cold have similar symptoms and it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. in general the flu is worse than the common cold and symptoms of flu including fever cough sore throat muscle or body aches and extreme tiredness tend to come on suddenly. people with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose although the flu also can cause those symptoms. influenza infection can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death while colds are usually milder and generally do not result in serious health problems. the best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year. also good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands can help stop the spread of many germs that make us sick.	can a cold develop into flu? . i've had a cold for about 4-5 days now and just yesterday i got a headache and had a wave of nausea a few hours later. this morning i woke up very sore despite having slept in my normal position and having done little physical work the previous day. i've had on and off nausea all day and am feeling warm. has my cold turned into the flu?
epilepsy is a disorder that is primarily diagnosed by history (the character of the episodes) and complemented by the results of other tests such as an mri and eeg. in over half of the cases no cause of the epilepsy is found. for most patients genetic testing is not helpful. there are rare cases of epilepsy where the cause is identified through genetic testing but it is not recommended for the great majority of individuals with epilepsy.	do you recommend genetic testing for a child with epilepsy?
if the symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least two weeks you should schedule a visit with his or her doctor to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to make sure that your child receives proper treatment. a consultation with a mental healthcare professional who specializes in children is also recommended. a mental health evaluation should include interviews with you (as the parents) and your child and any additional psychological testing that is necessary. information from teachers friends and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. there are no specific tests -- medical or psychological -- that can clearly show depression but tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents) combined with personal information can be very useful.	how is depression diagnosed in children?
a complex study published in may 2011 involved about 18 000 women and 1330 episodes of contraceptive failure. researchers looked at the data on women both during months of contraceptive success (i. e. not getting pregnant) versus contraceptive failure to see if taking antibiotics made any difference. the bottom line: contraceptive failures did occur but it was no more likely to occur if a woman was taking oral antibiotics. warning: it is well known that one particular antibiotic rifampin does definitely change the metabolism of many oral contraceptives. the study excluded women on that medication because the interaction of rifampin and contraceptives is well established. if you’re taking rifampin you must use a second form of birth control. even the best largest studies can’t say with 100% certainty that a super-rare event can’t occur. it could be that in very rare cases antibiotics could somehow affect the way oral contraceptives work. so if you want to be super-safe using two contraceptives is never a mistake.	do antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives?
brown spots on the hands and face have been called liver spots. but there is no connection whatsoever between these spots and the liver. these brown areas of pigmentation are actually due to sun exposure and skin aging. hydroquinone is a bleaching molecule that can help lighten the spots. however it is only available in only 2% strength over the counter. if this kind of product does not work for you see your physician to obtain a prescription for a 4% hydroquinone treatment which may work faster and more effectively. lastly laser treatments may ultimately be the best way to resolve these brown spots.	what kinds of the otc products are best for getting rid of liver spots?
the causes of ulcerative colitis is not known. to date there has been no convincing evidence that it is caused by infection or is contagious. ulcerative colitis likely involves abnormal activation of the immune system in the intestines. the immune system is composed of immune cells and the proteins that these cells produce. these cells and proteins serve to defend the body against harmful bacteria viruses fungi and other foreign invaders. activation of the immune system causes inflammation within the tissues where the activation occurs. (inflammation is in fact an important mechanism of defense used by the immune system. ) normally the immune system is activated only when the body is exposed to harmful invaders. in patients ulcerative colitis however the immune system is abnormally and chronically activated in the absence of any known invader. the continued abnormal activation of the immune systems causes chronic inflammation and ulceration. the susceptibility to abnormal activation of the immune system is genetically inherited. first degree relatives (brothers sisters children and parents) of patients with ibd are thus more likely to develop these diseases. in the last 1 to 2 years there have been multiple studies using genome wide association scans investigating genetic susceptibility in ulcerative colitis. these studies have found there to be approximately 30 genes that might increase susceptibility to ulcerative colitis including immunoglobulin receptor gene fcgr2a 5p15 2p16 ormdl3 ecm1 as well as regions on chromosomes 1p36 12q15 7q22 22q13 and il23r. at this early point in the research it is still unclear how these genetic associations will be applied to treating the disease but they might have future implications for understanding pathogenesis and creating new treatments.	what causes ulcerative colitis?
yes starting october 1 you can start shopping for a new health plan through your state's health insurance marketplace. if you buy coverage by december 15 2013 your plan will go into effect january 1 2014. the cost of your health plan may be lower than what you're currently paying particularly if you qualify for a tax credit. it's also likely that if you buy your own health insurance now (meaning you don't get coverage through an employer) that your benefits may be richer than what you have now. you can get a good idea about whether you're likely to qualify for a tax credit and a ball park figure of what your insurance may cost under aca by plugging in some basic information into webmd's health insurance cost calculator.	i can no longer afford my health plan. will i be able to decline my plan and sign up for the affordable care act.
it is uncommon to follow a low glucose diet as it is found in many carbohydrate foods and a true allergy is rare. table sugar or sucrose is made up of two simple sugars fructose and glucose. fruits and vegetables also contain both fructose and glucose. lactose the sugar in milk is made up of the simple sugars glucose and galactose. glucose is also part of corn syrup high fructose corn syrup honey and other syrups. you may have been advised to follow a low sugar diet or low glycemic diet. that would mean choosing whole foods without added sugars such as fruits vegetables whole grains lean meats unsweetened dairy products. check labels for words that are code for sugar such as maltose dextrose brown rice syrup high fructose corn syrup malt syrup molasses cane sugar corn sweetener raw sugar fruit juice concentrate syrup honey and evaporated cane juice. for more on hidden foods with added sugars see this article <link> this article reviews a low glycemic diet <link> always check with a healthcare provider when following a restricted diet.	i am trying to stay away from glucose. i need a food plan that doesn't have glucose.

most helpful answer the answer here isn't quite as straightforward as you might think so let me try to explain. it's true an ecg doesn't look inside the body the way an angiogram does. however an ecg does trace the heart's electrical conduction system. if an artery in the heart has become blocked and caused a portion of the heart muscle to die this can affect the electrical conduction system. and that damage in turn would be reflected on an ecg. that's probably why your relative's cardiologist is going directly to angioplasty. actually the physician likely will perform an angiogram first then do the angioplasty immediately afterwards. instead of having to undergo two procedures your relative will only go through one. that's healthier in many ways. it reduces infection risk and your relative will only have to recover one time instead of two. if your relative has any questions about why his or her cardiologist is choosing this particular treatment your relative should speak up. every patient has a right to know why a procedure is being performed what the expected outcome is and what the recovery will be like. communication is key in getting great medical treatment and sometimes that communication has to start with the patient. best wishes to you and your relative!	can a doctor decide that if there is any blockage in blood vein by doing ecg? . one of my relative had a chest pain n hospitalized immediately. he has been monitored closely by a cardiac doctor and by doing an ecg the doctor concluded that he has a block in blood vein and need to be removed by doing angioplasty. but he never done angiogram!
sinusitis may be classified in several ways based on the time span of the problem (acute subacute or chronic) and the type of inflammation (either infectious or noninfectious). acute sinus infection (also termed acute sinusitis caused by infection) is usually defined as being of less than 30 days duration. subacute sinus infection as being over 1 month but less than 3 months. chronic sinus infection as being greater than 3 months duration. there is no medical consensus on the above time periods. infected sinusitis usually is caused by uncomplicated virus infection. less frequently bacterial growth causes sinus infection and fungal sinus infection is very infrequent. subacute and chronic forms of sinus infection usually are the result of incomplete treatment of an acute sinus infection. noninfectious sinusitis is caused by irritants and allergic conditions and follows the same general time line for acute subacute and chronic as infectious sinusitis.	what are the types of sinus infections?

penile pumps and there’s mechanical devices that you can use those are all good for erection. and they work great. before the days of viagra that was a common operation if a guy had diabetes or a prior pelvic surgery and he couldn’t get an erection and injections didn’t work we had amazing results with penile implants whether inflatable or mechanical. and almost all the men who had those implants were thrilled with them. in the old days you had about one out of a hundred would break and you’d have to go back and fix it. either the pump would go bad or a line would erode or something would go wrong or leak. the newer advances in products are so much better. they not only increase they not only fill length but fill girth and they are far more reliable with rare risks of complications. but with the advent of these new medications out now most men don’t need that. there’s still a need for it and there’s still experts around the world that specialize in that and get great results. but that doesn’t change the length or the width of the penis. it just simply restores the ability for rigidity.	do penile pumps work?

"reasons for abnormal thyroid hormone levels will depend on what the cause of the intrinsic thyroid disease is to begin with. in hashimoto's thyroiditis where the body makes antibodies against the thyroid gland levels of circulating thyroid hormone may vary depending on the status of the hashimoto's disease. in grave's disease patients can vary from overactive to underactive thyroid hormone over time. in people with thyroid nodules determining whether the growth(s) on the thyroid gland are malignant or not may account for variations in thyroid hormone levels. in people for whom a medicine such as lithium is suppressing the circulating levels of thyroid hormone levels may vary depending on the use of lithium. lastly in people with dietary deficiencies of iodine production of thyroid hormone can be affected. thyroid hormone is at best a weak treatment for depression and low thyroid hormone is usually ""the"" explanation for depression only when tsh levels are extremely high. in someone without existing thyroid disease i would not attach a lot of importance to thyroid hormone levels unless the tsh level was very much higher than 10."	twice in the last 5 yrs my thyroid medication totally quit working. why would this happen? my depression is unbearable.

hydrocodone is a potent pain medication that is highly-addictive. it would not be likely that a medical professional would prescribe this opiate as an antidepressant or so that you can feel euphoric and more energetic any more than a medical provider would give you an amphetamine to speed you up. even people with chronic pain should be wary of addicting themselves to opiates.	can hydrocodone be prescribed as an anti-depressant? was on it for pain and it worked 10x better than my antidepressant. i was on hydrocodone for pain after my 6th hernia operation and i found that it worked 10x better than my current anti-depressant lexapro. i found myself being more patient happier and was no longer taking afternoon naps which i found myself doing every day with the lexapro. i did get a euphoric feeling when i first took it but it wore off after about 10-15 min and i was full of energy for the rest of the day. can my psychiatrist prescribe this to me instead of lexapro for my depression?

you have most likely genetically inherited your acne. however your breakouts may get worse when you eat more of certain foods. many studies have been conducted concerning the connection between diet and acne. and so far the most conclusive evidence is that a high glycemic index diet (a diet high in refined sugars) can worsen acne breakouts. some data also suggest that dairy foods can worsen acne due to presence of certain androgenic hormones in cow's milk. if you notice a link between when you consume dairy and the severity of your acne you may benefit from eating dairy substitutes and products that don't contain casein or whey.	could the acne on my back have anything to do with my diet?

gluten is a protein found in wheat and grain products. people on a gluten-free diet often avoid wheat rye and barley; though there is also debate on whether to avoid oats as well. a gluten-free diet allows for fresh fruits vegetables meat/poultry/fish and many dairy products. unprocessed beans and nuts are also acceptable as well as products made with rice corn and soy. if not buying fresh food it’s important to always read food labels to look for foods specifically labeled as gluten-free. for example foods like cereal bread and lunch meat may or may not contain gluten so the only way to know for sure is to check the packaging. the food industry can use gluten in many products that don't seem like they would contain gluten so it's important to always read the label first. having a family history of food allergies could mean that your granddaughter may have a genetic predisposition to having food allergies as well. it may be beneficial for her to try an elimination diet to identify any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that she may have. the basic premise of this eating plan is to initially restrict eating to very basic foods and then to gradually reincorporate more foods. the person doing this can then better discern which foods trigger a negative response when added back into their diet. review this webmd article for more information on elimination diets and also consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before implementing drastic dietary changes. well she has celiacs disease (non life threatning disease) but she can not have wheat so feed her corn based products like ( some chex mix cerals corn tortillas some soups any thing that says gluten free on the label	my granddaughter has to have a gluton free diet what can i feed her? . she has stomach pain alot and she has a cousin (her aunts child) that is allergic to gluten so they want to put her my granddaughter on a gluten free diet to see if this helps her. i need to know what i can and cant feed her and what i can substitute so she still gets nutrients she needs. with out it costing me an arm and a leg im on a rather small income but want to do whats best for her.

most helpful answer a gastroenterologist is a licensed and highly-trained physician. many were primary care clinicians before they specialized. while a vaginal exam may not be integral part of his/her practice finding the underlying reason for undiagnosed abdominal pain may require more than just a short trip up the colon or down the throat to the stomach. pelvic causes for abdominal pain are really high on the list so this clinician is most likely being very thorough. they are definitely allowed to do this exam if there is a justifiable reason to do so. now if your podiatrist or a chiropractor wanted to do a vaginal exam i would call that highly-suspicious.	are gastroenterologist allowed to perform vaginal exams on a patient who complains about abdominal pain?
the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is a time of stress and may be difficult for family and friends. here are some tips for family and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer: feel free to ask the doctor questions if you accompany your loved one to her appointments. be prepared for changes in your loved one's behavior and mood. medications discomforts and stress can cause her to become depressed angry or fatigued. encourage your loved one to be as active and independent as possible to help him or her regain a sense of self-reliance and confidence. be realistic about your own needs. be sure you are sleeping enough eating properly and taking some time off for yourself. it is hard to offer much help when you are exhausted. if you take care of your needs it may be easier to meet the needs of your loved one. don't hesitate to ask other family members and friends for help. they will appreciate the opportunity to help.	what should family and friends keep in mind when someone has breast cancer?
those problematic moles can be surgically removed easily by your medical provider (if they do this type of procedure) or a dermatologist. there are many methods to do this but most are either a shave biopsy or an excisional biopsy. larger ones may require a tiny stitch or two; smaller ones may just be cauterized. this is definitely not something you can do a home. the moles will then be sent to pathology to be tested to make sure they are benign. there are no non-surgical ways of removing them.	i have hanging moles on my neck that hurt at times and are just plain irritating. how can i get rid of them?

For some time now, probably 6 months or more, I also began feeling that my legs were heavy and just general weakness all over, not really muscle weakness. I am also a gastric bypass patient and have a history of low B12, iron saturation and low vitamin D. To complicate matters even more, I went to an orthopedic spine specialist about a month ago, due to the stiffness in my neck. I was unable to turn side to side and this has been going on for several years, like 5 or more. Also, I have a sharp pain between my shoulder blades. My cervical MRI shows moderate facet joint arthritis, small central spur on C5-C6 and some compression of the spinal cord. Even more complicated is that the MRI showed thyroid nodules and the ultrasound reported as typical of a multinodular goiter. My TSH was 4.18.I visited my family doctor and he said that the twitches were probably from low vitamin B12. He gave me an injection yesterday and took blood to measure B12 and vitamin D. My vitamin B12 is more than 2000 and vitamin D is 9. I am going insane thinking that I have some horrible neurological disorder with the twitches and tingling in my calves, general fatigue and heavy feeling of my legs when I walk. My primary care physician did a strength test on arms and legs and said it was normal. Can low vitamin B12 and vitamin D cause these symptoms? I just feel weird and scared.
"i agree with your doctor. herpes simplex (cold sores) are typically only contagious and transmitted during a active outbreak. since millions of people on this planet have latent herpes virus in their system those children will be eventually exposed by someone. a classmate or day-care cohort. most likely sometime in their lives. should they get it it will not likely be from a loving grandmother who just wants to kiss her grandchildren. new parents are worried about everything but this is one virus that is unlikely to come from you. about 50% of the people who get one cold sore will never get another the rest of their lives so should we advise they never to kiss another person? most people like you can have periodic outbreaks but the infrequency of your events show that you have an excellent immune system that is suppressing this virus. my advice for you is to kiss those grandchildren when you do not have an outbreak and my advice for your daughter is to ""get real"". a grandmother's love cures more boo-boos and i suspect your kisses will be risk-free."	i had a cold sore once. can this be passed on to my grandchildren if they kiss me or drink or eat after me? . a few times in y 64 yrs when i have had a cold sore. can i pass this to my grandchildren by kissing or letting them drink after me. my physician said i would have to have an outbreak for the children to catch it from me. my daughter doesn't believe it and the babies are always wanting to kiss grammie please help as i feel like they will be fine i kissed my own babies (5 of them) they drank after me no one ever got a cold sore.
for people with obstructive sleep apnea (osa) a cpap machine can be a life-changing device. i’ve written about the importance of regularly using your cpap machine before but there may be even more benefits to use of a cpap. most people with osa aren’t aware that they stop breathing multiple times during the night. this results in fragmented poor sleep as well as low blood oxygen levels. osa has been associated with an increased risk for myriad health problems including hypertension heart disease mood and memory problems — even difficulties driving. cpap stands for continuous positive airway pressure and cpap machines are the most effective and helpful treatment currently available for patients with osa. a new study in the journal sleep suggests that cpap therapy can do much more than improve sleep: patients who regularly use a cpap machine felt significantly less fatigue throughout the day. patients who regularly use a cpap machine also had much more energy. patients felt considerably less daytime sleepiness particularly patients who had previously been excessively sleepy or fatigued. scientists aren’t certain how and why cpap therapy can have these additional positive effects but they think that cpap may reduce inflammation which in turn reduces fatigue. whatever the reason this is great news for people who have osa — and even better news for people who are already using cpap machines to improve the quality of their sleep. i’ve said before that the cpap machine isn’t exactly the most attractive or sexy addition to your bedroom. but in addition to completely transforming the way a person with osa sleeps it also has the potential to help people feel less fatigued and have more energy throughout the day. we already knew that cpap improves the quality of sleep of many many people — and spares their partners hours of listening to the snoring and loud breathing that can accompany osa. this study just gives us a few more reasons to recommend that patients with osa use their machines every night. the amazing machine that could. i use a bipap every night and it has made a significant difference in the way that i feel - at least in the morning. unfortunately in addition to sleep apnea i have severe hypersomnolence and i often fall asleep at my desk during the day while working. i can really feel the difference when i fall asleep without using my bipap and my throat is often dry and sore. yes! i have sleep apnea. when should my bipap or cpap machine be used?	i have obstructive sleep apnea. do i need to use my cpap machine every night?

ultimately all hernias are caused by a combination of pressure and an opening or weakness of muscle or fascia: the pressure pushes an organ or tissue through the opening or weak spot. sometimes the muscle weakness is present at birth; more often it occurs later in life. poor nutrition smoking and overexertion all can weaken muscles and make hernias more likely. anything that causes an increase in pressure in the abdomen can then cause a hernia including obesity lifting heavy objects diarrhea or constipation or persistent coughing or sneezing.	what causes hernia?

"when someone is making strong nutrition claims like this i always ask people to inquire about the research used to support the claim. many times people without a health or science background translate information into something that is not accurate. green leafy vegetables contain oxalates but there is no evidence that these foods are bad for health. there are instances where someone may need to limit oxalates such as those who are prone to kidney stones but this is not a concern for the general ""healthy"" population. most people can include green leafy vegetables like those in smoothies as part of a healthy diet. in fact it is encouraged! the 2010 dietary guidelines recommend green leafy vegetables along with those that are orange (sweet potatoes carrots etc. ) starchy (potatoes corn) and other vegetables like cucumbers and zucchini. variety is always best to meet nutritional needs and maximize health. if you are concerned about oxalates check with your health care provider."	i saw an article which said that consuming green smoothie every day may be devastating for your health is that true?
rh sensitization can occur when a person with rh-negative blood is exposed to rh-positive blood. about 90% of women who become sensitized do so during childbirth when their blood mixes with the rh-positive blood of their fetus. 1 once exposed a mother's immune system produces antibodies against rh-positive red blood cells. for more information about events and procedures that can put you at high risk for rh sensitization see the what increases your risk section of this topic. the minimum amount of blood mixing necessary to cause sensitization is not known. but many women become sensitized during pregnancy or childbirth after being exposed to as little as of rh-positive fetal blood. 1 fortunately rh sensitization can almost always be prevented with the rh immune globulin injection. when an rh-negative person's immune system is first exposed to rh-positive blood it takes several weeks to develop immunoglobulin m or igm antibodies. igm antibodies are too large to cross the placenta. so the rh-positive fetus that first triggers maternal sensitization is usually not harmed. a previously rh-sensitized immune system rapidly reacts to rh-positive blood as during a second pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus. usually within hours of rh-positive blood exposure smaller immunoglobulin g or igg antibodies are formed. igg antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. this causes rh disease which is dangerous for the fetus. some rh-negative people never become sensitized even after exposure to large amounts of rh-positive blood. the reason for this is not known. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes rh sensitization during pregnancy?

i think it depends on his eating overall. if he eats a variety of food but just doesn't like food really sweet that may simply reflect his personal preferences. but if he eats very few foods it could indicate a sensory issue or that he is super taster (not serious -- just more sensitive to the tastes in food). if you feel his nutrition and growth is affected see his pediatrician for a referral to a feeding therapist who can help you figure out what is going on. good luck!	you asked: my son is 6 year old he don't like to eat those food which taste sweet is there any disorder in his taste bud

well that's difficult to say. it probably means nothing. yellow is the color we expect urine to be. if you take a vitamin supplement these can sometimes give the urine an almost fluorescent color a very bright yellow or yellow-green. that's just due to the dyes in the vitamin. if you've eaten anything recently with yellow dye in it that could also be a reason for bright yellow urine. sometimes very colorful urine indicates dehydration. the more concentrated urine is the darker or richer the color of it is. if you have no other symptoms such as pain with urination abdominal pain or lower back pain your bright yellow urine probably doesn't mean anything in terms of your overall health. if you develop any problems urinating or if the bright color persists then by all means consult a medical professional. hope this helps!	what does it mean if my urine is bright yellow?
no. you are born a certain way based on your genetics. if you don’t like your genitals then choose different parents. if you’re fat down there then you can lose weight and improve the length of your penis but there is nothing you can do taking herbs will not improve your penile length weights on the end of your bed while you sleep will not improve it the vacuum devices that they sell will not do it. you are born with what you’re born with and rather than stress and fret about problems or perceived inadequacies you really should be focusing on ways of finessing what you’ve got to make yourself and your partners happy. what you can do is be healthy take care of yourself learn other techniques to enhance the relationship it’s not just all about penile length there’s other things that you can do during lovemaking that will enhance pleasure for the female partner if that’s what it’s all about. if it’s just simply wanting to feel proud in the shower in front of other guys then you just have to understand that that’s who you are that’s how you were born and rather than spending your energy and time focusing on what you don’t have focus on what you do have.	will herbal supplements enlarge my penis?

high fever and chill are indicative of infection indeed and as we have a cause rightly evident there are chances that you may be developing hydronephrosis (accumulation of urine in swollen kidney) in the right kidney and a secondary infection following stasis of urine (stoppage or reduced flow of urine) in the kidney leading to nephritis. though urine culture generally picks up infection in the bladder nephritis is more of a clinical diagnosis with pain and tenderness in the renal angle and high grade fever accompanying it. ideally you should be started on prophylactic antibiotics to control the infection sooner before septic features or septicemia may occur. i think you should take a second opinion from another urologist too. for further information consult a urologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am a 41 year old woman, and started having severe lower back pain and nausea about a week ago.

I was not able to get an appointment until yesterday.  Two days after my ER visit, I began having severe chills and running fever as high as 101.5.

Because the stone is blocking the ureter. But, urine I am passing is clear and uninfected. Please help.

well i have tried to look up on line what the 10 or 13 herbs are without success. the problem with taking in herbs in general are they are not regulated and many times physicians don't know what the ingredients are. having said that there are not too many products that are found to be harmful to the unborn fetus. plus if you are not feeling well we many times will say it is ok to take different medications during pregnancy. cough drops are one that usually will not cause any specific harm. the real question is when did you take the medication? how much did you take becuase these all have a say if there is any harm to the fetus. in teratology there are three things you must have in order for the fetus to be harmed. 1. the drug must be a known teratogen 2. the dose must be high enough to cause harm 3. the timing must be correct- that period of organogenesis. accutane is the perfect drug that we know is harmful even at the human dose. it has all three characteristics. for you i don't have the exact answer. you should ask your physician to investigate. the real issue is you will find out soon enough when your baby is born. in all likelihood your baby will be just fine.	are ricola cough drops ok to take during pregnancy?

acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease. normally acne develops between the age of 12-25 years. however acne is not limited to any particular age group. as people grow and become older or in younger people acne is becoming a point of concern. acne is known as the disease of the pilosebaceous units (psus). psus are found underneath the skin surface but are more in number on the face back and chest. psus consist of oil glands (sebaceous gland). these oil glands secrete oil to the skin which makes skin moisturized and soft. but in case of any pathophysiological changes in these glands due to external or internal factors can lead to acne this can be either be blackheads or whiteheads. for more information on this you can visit drugsdropship24. the acne triggering factors are listed below: oil glands are over stimulated by increase secretion of sex hormones called androgens that release in both boys and girls during adolescence. diseases like polycystic ovary syndrome and cushing's syndrome hormonal changes due to menstruation pregnancy or hormonal therapy like birth control pills cosmetic mostly moisturizers and oily preparations genetics pathogenic invasion like propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis secondary physical factors such as diet personal hygiene (dirt sweat) and stress incidence of acne on the basis of age: acne affects 90% teenagers. acne generally begins with the onset of adolescence when androgen concentration begins to increase in the body on the basis of gender: acne is more common in males than females during puberty. however during adulthood due to hormonal changes women become prone to acne.	what causes acne?

after an operation cardiologist and my doctor decided to put me under statines and cardioaspirine and i followed their prescriptions for one year since i noticed that i have muscular problems and strange troubles when i streched them. one time i had to stay in bed for 3 days without force like if it was a serious atack of flue. after i read that this was a side effect of statines i decided to stop and to change my life. one year after and 10kg less i just pass an exam and the cardiologist says to me that everything is perfect cholesterol is under the limit cardiogram and an effort test have been without any problem. the doctor says to me to continue absolutely with statines and cardioaspirine as i didn't say to him that i stop to take them since one year for me is a good sign. the results are obtained like this: with exercice and with a strict dieta. every morning from 7 to 9 i do exercices in a fitness center. one part with a group one part alone with all the machines. in one year i frequently arrive to make exercices that many young people can't and i'm like an exemple for that center as i am 70 years old. i only take a rest one time a week. about dieta i avoid all industrial food like cakes or pastries but also bread rice potatoes pastas and pizzas (especially in the evening) i only eat meat one time a week (frequently chicken with a glass of wine) the other days only fish and 4 o 5 different vegetables cooked in the oven. two to 4 meals a week with nuts and seeds of any kind. (15 different sorts in a very small quantity as together it can be 150 grams). i was never feeling so well and i'm still actifve in my company. frankly statines are the contrary of what we need as they provoke muscular problems and other different sicknesses and this can impeach you to make the exercice that you need. it's really a non-sense medication! you are becoming impotent and more sick instead of beeing better. when i heard that actually there is a campaign among doctors and medias to prescribe statines even for chieldren it's really like a crime. the level of cholesterol has been invented by doctors payed by the producers of statines and not by indipendent doctors. remember.	how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. .

hi this is from the mayo clinic. for someone who doesn't have diabetes a normal a1c level can range from 4. 5 to 6 percent. someone who's had uncontrolled diabetes for a long time might have an a1c level above 8 percent. when the a1c test is used to diagnose diabetes an a1c level of 6. 5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates you have diabetes. a result between 5. 7 and 6. 4 percent is considered prediabetes which indicates a high risk of developing diabetes. for most people who have previously diagnosed diabetes an a1c level of 7 percent or less is a common treatment target. higher targets may be chosen in some individuals. if your a1c level is above your target your doctor may recommend a change in your diabetes treatment plan. remember the higher your a1c level the higher your risk of diabetes complications. your find more at this link. <link> if this dose not show blue just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck ps yes get exercising and look up what to eat to get back on track try googling the diabetes diet you should find all the help you need.	my a1c test showed my number at 6. 7 can i improve my number with diet and exercise? i do not want to take medication

sorry you're experiencing this. bloating is especially uncomfortable! usually pale or clay-colored stools indicate a lack of bile in the stool. however the color change can also be related to consuming anti-diarrheal medications like kaopectate. if your symptoms persist or get worse i'd suggest you see a doctor. sometimes clay-colored stool can indicate a blocked bile duct (such as from a gallstone). if your scelera (the white parts of the eyeyball) start turning yellow or your skin gets yellowish or if you spike a fever or start vomiting you should seek immediate medical attention by going to the emergency room. these could be signs of a serious bile duct obstruction. i hope you feel better soon!	i have a pale clay looking stool with the consistency of caulk bloating and stomach pains. . i have not changed my diet or habits lately.

the warnings are a bit more urgent for pregnant and lactating women who are vegan. having a vitamin b12 deficiency particularly has been shown to impair neurological development in infants nursed by vegetarian mothers. a lack of vitamin d and calcium also can result in bone demineralization in breastfeeding women. similarly young children (under 5) reared on vegetarian and vegan diets can suffer impaired growth. that's because of a vitamin b12 deficiency which can also result in anemia and rickets. yet a well planned diet can meet all the nutritional needs. absorbable calcium is critical too for vegans and ovo-vegetarians to protect against weak bones that can lead to osteoporosis.	is a vegan diet safe during pregnancy?

yes. television stimulates brain areas that interfere with sleep; it also suppresses the release of melatonin a natural hormone important in day-night cycling. children and teens especially tend to use even-more stimulating gadgets near bedtime. video games include rapid graphic images. computers cell phones and ipads support thousands of interactive applications that connect kids socially without any particular “off time. ” children with cell- or web-connected devices in their bedrooms get not only the sleep-depriving effect of bright screens at bedtime but may also continue to play games and communicate with friends well after what parents might have thought was “lights out. ” there are significant social health and educational consequences facing kids who aren’t getting their needed 8-10 hours of sleep every night. underslept children do poorer in school often exhibiting “add-like” behavior. they have more trouble getting along with friends and family and are more likely to struggle with obesity and depression. many teens who feel sleepy consume huge servings of coffee to stay awake which can further disrupt their normal sleep rhythm and leave them even more sleep-deprived.	can too much computer or tv time at night adversely affect children’s health?

the actual minimal number of calories that you can safely eat long term depends on your basal metabolic rate (bmr) which is the energy necessary for your body and its organs to maintain normal function while simply at rest. although there are equations to calculate bmr such as the harris-benedict equation these are all theoretical estimations and your actual number could vary. there are other more accurate methods to calculate your bmr through either direct or indirect calorimetry techniques that usually measure gas exchange between oxygen consumption and co2 production. you could do an internet search to find test facilities near you for these methods if you’re genuinely curious otherwise the bmr equations might give you a good enough estimate. you’re correct in stating that 1 200 calories is typically the conventional lower threshold value given and i think that it’s fair to use as an estimate for most of the general population (again your actual number will vary). by far however 800 calories per day would be considered a very low calorie diet (vlcd) because it would be very hard to meet your nutritional needs with so few calories. this type of diet would generally not be recommended for individuals who are not obese and who don’t have proper medical supervision. your doctor will take your specific circumstances into consideration before helping you decide if you should go on a vlcd and you may need to work with a dietitian to develop a specific eating plan to help ensure that you meet your nutrient needs while following the diet. it’s important to note that although vlcds have been shown to lower weight and help with obesity-related conditions like hypertension diabetes or high cholesterol in obese individuals; they don’t seem to be any more effective than a more modest dietary eating plan long term. you will likely regain any weight loss after going off the vlcd unless you transition into a healthy eating plan while incorporating regular exercise which is another aspect of why medical supervision from your doctor or a dietitian would be essential.	what is the minimum number of calories a woman can safely eat long term (up to two years or more)? . i’ve seen numbers ranging from 800 to 1200 (even here on webmd) where 800 might be the break between low calorie and very low calorie and 1050 is where your body enters starvation mode. . 1200 is the conventional number but is this in keeping with modern understanding? if a person opted for 800 without supervision would this be safe and sustainable long-term provided it was followed with proper transition and maintenance?
your doctor will probably prescribe several medicines after you have had a transient ischemic attack (tia). medicines to prevent blood clots are typically used because blood clots can cause tias and strokes. the types of medicines that prevent clotting are: antiplatelet medicines. anticoagulant medicines. cholesterol -lowering and blood pressure -lowering medicines are also used to prevent tias and strokes. antiplatelet medicines antiplatelets (such as aspirin aspirin with extended-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel ) keep platelets in the blood from sticking together. aspirin is most often used to prevent tias and strokes. many studies have shown that aspirin helps prevent strokes and reduces the risk of another tia in people who have had their first tia. other antiplatelet medicines (such as clopidogrel) may be used for people who cannot take aspirin or for whom aspirin has not been effective. aggrenox a medicine that combines aspirin with dipyridamole is a safe and effective alternative to aspirin to prevent tia and stroke for some people. 9 anticoagulants anticoagulants prevent the production of certain proteins that are needed for blood to clot. if you have atrial fibrillation you will probably take an anticoagulant (such as warfarin ). anticoagulants are more effective than antiplatelets in preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. 4 both anticoagulants and antiplatelets increase the risk of bleeding. warfarin (such as coumadin ) has the highest risk of bleeding problems but the risk is lower when the dosage is closely monitored. if you take warfarin don't suddenly change your intake of foods that are rich in vitamin k. vitamin k can interfere with the action of anticoagulants making it more likely that your blood will clot. for more information see: anticoagulants: vitamin k and your diet. cholesterol-lowering medicines experts recommend that most people who have had a tia take statins which lower cholesterol. many studies show that statins significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a tia. statins even protect against stroke in people who do not have heart disease or high cholesterol. 5 for more information on these medicines see the topic high cholesterol. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat transient ischemic attack tia?
