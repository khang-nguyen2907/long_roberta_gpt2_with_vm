0	It's useless chicken soup. It's hardly helpful. But the theory about bells is thought out. The market always has its own operating cycle, and the most dangerous thing is that you have a moment of doubt about the concept of the cycle.
0	I'm curious to see a group of readers who play the five stars in this book... and the psychology guide puts a video clip on Wang Mingyang, reading the novel and finding out that it's a little bit of a cynicism...
0	Can you talk a little more?
0	If I can't help it, it's a bad one. I don't usually score.
1	It is difficult to tell a book of 22 months and 10 kilometres of journeys in which beauty and hardship require me to put myself down to experience.
0	It's no big deal. Wenqing's dream.
0	I don't want this kind of story to be on TV.
0	It's too fake. It's like ice.
1	It's watery, it's watery, it's watery, it's all available, it's wastey.
1	It's written about our high school and university life in the 90s, especially in the upper secondary sector, and it's resonant, it's very real and it's very moving.
0	And look again, it's so embarrassing, it's so ugly, it's hard to read. It's an international joke to catch up with Aileen.
1	It's very easy to read, it's very easy to play, it's unfortunate for the lady to be weak, and it's a good thing to be close to her. And it's nice to be her sister! Hong Kong has a very small culture.
0	It's a very thick book, isn't it?
0	People who don't have character, of course, can't write anything good.
1	A lot of movies haven't been seen. So it's just a glimpse.
0	It's just a pen. It doesn't get much out of it.
1	There was a guy who wanted to do a movie.
1	We'll see the book after the movie.
0	Maybe I'm old enough to accept the incompetence of the plot, the language...
1	It's hard to read many times, it's slow, it's slow, it's easy to read, it's good to see, it's sad to feel the story. The author's work is deep, it's white-faced, it's written down on paper, it's a lot of intense scenes and emotions, but it's in a way that the princess's love, when she's asleep, it's beautiful, but it's the last time she's seen the story, and it's hard to see, even if you're a princess, to live in the royal shackles, to do what the princess should do, to love, or even to compromise her love. Perhaps the most exciting part of the story is that I've been able to love, to leave on the night when she's asleep, and to know how much love can be cut off, to see the princess's sleep face, and that's the last part of her life.
0	At the middle school teacher's level, there's no need to block him at his theoretical level, and it's recommended that the government pay to keep him as a symbol of democracy.
0	Friends recommend... reading the first two chapters, losing the battle, the level of YY in H... such a man is too familiar to see you in every post!
0	Ray!
1	It's solid.
1	This book is especially suitable for authors, not just writers, novelists, etc., to read and learn. In fact, as an audience of fans, I see a lot of things. At least I can keep my sober mind away from the scoundrels.
0	It's a disappointment. The writings in Ming Xiao Creek are the same. There's no progress at all. Language is still so childish. It's a terrible book.
1	In fact, in the advance of history, the author’s point of view is gradually recognized, and the logical sequence is clear. The British’s unique sense of humor is interesting, but the theme is still heavy “whatever the cost, it is worth as long as it guarantees that the world they expect will never be realized”.
1	The road to a desperate destiny.
0	The author's car sarcasm.
0	It's an interesting subject, but the author says a book and doesn't seem to say anything.
0	It's the usual language drama, as a youth novel, and it's the same as a woman's head. I don't have any sense of introspection in a man like me. It's the best movie in the original/film/net.
0	I can't.
0	Copying and selling copyrights.
1	Grab a touch of your touch, write it down, get a point of view, get a point of argument, and then you're gonna have an approximate prototype.
0	The author really learns Chinese? The whole story of bedmaking and killing is so boring that he can't see where love is, can't feel it, can't feel it, can't feel it, can't feel it, can't feel it, can't feel it, can't hurt it, can't write it. It's too childish.
0	I'm after it, Ray!
0	It's normal.
0	Translation is really a mess. It's probably the translator's deliberate attempt to imitate it, and there's a lot of sick sentences. Too many adjectives are omitted so that sometimes he doesn't know who he's talking about. There are a few mistakes, one where Alexander saves his father, says things in his own account, and one where he's talking about his father, but he's using a good name.
0	Almost couldn't read.
0	What do you like about him?
1	Great recommendation! That's a good novel.
1	Well, we're usually normal fools.
1	I stand before you for life and death, for good and for evil, and therefore for life. — Bible The Book of Judgment, 30:19.
1	Neither Ho Hsiao-hyun nor Chu should be missed.
0	Close to chatting.
1	It's always the desire to part.
1	It's a good book. It helps.
1	It's really sad to see it all... the sense of desolation in everyone's heart and the tiny, lonely pond inside everyone's heart.
1	Summer '07. One day, he went out to eat and drink, had a high drink, vomited and had a long time. Sleeping half-night, waking up at 3:00 a.m., couldn't sleep, so he picked up this long-saled book under the bookshelve. He liked Huang In-woo's great historical view.
0	I don't understand.
1	Rubber. Pistol.
0	It's no wonder it's not included in the Collection of Taiding. It's like writing on a title written by a high school student. Making such a thick copy is a fraud. Such a 100-page piece of writing is not worthy of such in-depth discussion.
1	Full of business history and common sense fully appreciate the lack of common sense of business.
1	Whatever the institutional analysis, this is a book of history, not of institutional economics.
0	He's so pretentious, he's got to say something. A short chapter says she doesn't want to believe it. She won't believe it. She doesn't want to think about it. She's tired and tired. She's got three seconds of silence. She's got a cold and heartache, and she's got three seconds to come. I don't think the author's words and pain in this novel. She's got mountains in her eyes, springs, ice, ink, water color, running light, moose, mackering, springs. And if they have a doge in their eyes, I won't be surprised.
0	It's a big recommendation, you son of a bitch. It stinks and it's long.
0	Three readings, giving up... and Napol's gonna cry when she sees it, and it's not Sherwood Anderson.
1	You don't have to say good books.
1	There's only that part of the book. There's only that part of the five stars.
1	Don't read Rusty.
0	What's in the last chapter... what's in every chapter...
1	It's a very good book, Inspector Chu of Istanbul.
0	The B4 is slashed and plasticized, and it's supported by the plain man's Hong Kong version!
1	The book prepared for the Society was read only in the sense of fear, fear and crisis, as if it had been written yesterday 20 years ago.
0	You said you wouldn't read that book.
1	It's getting better in the back! The first time Nietzsche's cured, the reader's cured.
0	Bullshit.
0	"Not as good as ""Brother."""
1	It's not easy.
0	Disappointment!
1	There's a warm side to the barbarous youth.
0	Is it supposed to be the way a textbook should be?
0	The translation can't be worse.
1	"""A road from home to home never ends."" From the small village on the coast of Ireland to New York, and then to the orphan train, and then to Minnesota, and then to Minnesota, Vivian's fate was so painful and so painful that he met those kind of nice people. The accident with the German boy allowed Vivian to relive and start a happy life, while the German child was killed again. When Vivian lost his beloved Vivian, he treated everything without giving up his whole heart and life without water, until Molly came along and changed the old Vivian of ninety-one years old, who was no longer alone in his late life, but began to embrace a changing society, learn online, start looking for the daughter of the year and feel warm and warm with his daughter!"
0	It's a pity you don't have any dry goods.
1	Because there's not much interest in what Geek's been looking for, and it's only now that it's too late, and it's too late to say anything about the '60s.
0	There is a dearth of language, so ancient novels are literal studies, and it is clear that some of the details written are modern and lack historical content.
0	The first family in Israel has a history.
0	Not very much of a notebook.
1	It's a one-year hiatus.
0	I'd love to, but Lee Myung-hye and the old man of the Year, who is too popular to be married, are so inexplicable to the coolness of the lily between my sister-in-law and Sanqing's other woman that it's not easy to write simply because it's a poetic language that can cover up the emptiness in the house, waste an epic story and a strong, high-strengthed character that doesn't say a word to the lady, and abandon it with determination.
1	Reason in the language structure (grammatical, logical, rhetorical) is mental unconscious (in Freud sense) rationality — which is the basis of Lacon’s theory, but, after all, it can only be a guess, and it is only a coincidence that it is the cause of some phenomena. This is what is called a transitional interpretation, which goes beyond human consciousness, and the interpretation of unconsciousness is, of course, only an “over” interpretation, but this excessive definition is questionable.
1	It's the one that says Martin's favorite.
0	Translation sucks.
0	Just look at the ancient part of history, the textbook narrative, there's no depth in many places. Little gains, like Song Dynasty, are richer than you think, and Ming Dynasty is clearer than you know.
0	It's easy to start with, and then it's dragging, and then it's three pages and then it's eating. And it's good to be eating, but the whole story is flat and white, and it's just a shake.
1	I was inspired by Professor To's sense of history and its deep weakness for the past, which has already taken place.
1	The script beats, and some other places are pretty good.
0	Huang In-woo's expression always gives me the feeling that, instead of being stunned, rhetorical, strong and strong... each time it comes to the key point of the principle, it suddenly slips away.
0	Can't understand the author's mind.
1	The mirrors are so cute, the images are easier to reach than the words.
0	It's easy. It's very normal.
0	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
1	It's more delicate than a movie.
0	That's stupid.
1	A good post-travel note, although not beautiful language, allows me to draw a picture of what he sees. Travel is a theme, not a walk.
1	I can't watch it anymore.
1	In my heart, hide one of you.
1	Let's get it up to date.
0	It's not dry.
1	Chinese, read it again. It's a matter of purpose. This time, it's a bit of a problem.
0	I can't accept a story like this. It's a hypothesis to read a novel, so it's too limited to something historical. It's better to look at Song's history.
0	It's really bad, but it's bad. It's bad for the writer to write. It's bad for the character to be white. It's boring for the character to write. It's boring for the story. It's hard for the writer to understand the original Confucian character, which has the power to enter the world and the virtues of the interior. It's too naive for the writer to look for a delicate balance in this tension and accomplish the twin goals of his career and reformation.
1	It's a book in the Grand Prix.
0	I can say that, although I can't stop spitting, I'd like to know what I said. Staying in Chengdu, found on the inn shelf.
1	"""The tension"" is particularly important in the larger context of the new wave, but it's so pale that you can only use a vanity to make a statement like that. How many people want to see it?"
0	Comrade Autumn Rain has studied the treatment of natural languages and has produced such a book using his own algorithms.
0	It's a bit of a waste of time.
0	Fitzgerald's detective novel. It's between the ages and the generations of culture. It's a really unpleasant reading experience.
1	Grim.
1	I don't understand.
1	I don't care if it's out of date or not.
0	Three.
0	There is no good difference between traditional goods such as books and music, and traditional goods such as pots and pans. The former will also be a world of Winner-take-all.
0	Unfortunately, I didn't finish this book. Maybe it's not my taste.
0	It's been a long time since the Ring was supposed to be six points.
1	"""The freedom to be granted only when it is known in advance of the good that freedom can bring, cannot be called freedom."""
0	Why don't you try the readers first?
1	Let's get in there and get to the basics of video photography.
0	I don't care how it's written, it's a good one, and then it's a cliché.
0	Any cat or dog can publish a book.
1	I don't like it any more.
1	Go back and go back.
1	Good book.
0	Looks like Dad's bookshelf. Hey, you've been watching novels all night long.
0	It's all bullshit!
1	"""People think it's good, but they don't like it."""
0	There's a bit of chatter.
0	It's nice to be young.
0	Sneak down your ass.
1	It's interesting to watch Podria talk about movies, isn't that what you've never seen?
1	Israel's entrepreneurial climate is beyond Chinese comprehension.
0	It's a garbage novel.
1	The bulk of the selections were excellent, especially before the new media era, when almost every work was excellent. The best impressions were by the Wondermen, the Tunnels, the Lonely Space Disk and the Penitential Joker IV. The Penitent Joker built a short anti-Utopia, while the Chevalier turned back on the beautiful, new world-style anti-Utopia, and the Space Discreet was a sort of extra-civilistic space romanticism (comparable with the Dark Forest Theory). There were a few pieces of the new era that were a little weaker, but they were also good overall, such as travelers, and one that was constantly loop's, which had the world's absurd, meaningless, existential tone (though at the end of the story had been reversed in an infamous way with the Orientian Curtain); and King Martin's sand, which, as in the past, had the shadow of the death of all the fire from behind it.
1	It's all funny.
0	I don't know, I can't understand.
1	The first half is a classic story about movie identity, film language, and the second half about story types and styles is out of date.
1	"It's really a big part of the healing system, looking at it this week, and it's gone. It's a good story, it's full of people, it's not like the soap opera that's in ""Agatha"" is suddenly slaged, it's a lot worse than Agatha. At the end of the day, Hung is dead, Jotai's dead, it's sad."
1	I remember hearing that my teachers at the School of Economics were divided into two parties and thought they were working in the field, but they only learned about the struggle between political and Western economics. The joke, read in a book, was that there was a real difference between politics and the West.
0	I see nothing but despair and ignorance, beyond my comprehension.
0	Seeing a piece of garbage that no one wants to clean is eternal?
0	It's not mine.
0	The Korean war was rife with a “patriotic” interpretation. The post-Gazpa Party was uncircumcised, probably because of commercial factors.
0	That's Popper.
0	Almost all of the comments were sent on November 8, suspected of being painted by the Navy. They could have been given to Samsung, but they could have been balanced by a star. The content itself could have been used as a copy. But many of the names had been translated differently, especially when the images explained that the names in the text were not in line with each other, the reading experience was bad, and they were not recommended for purchase. (Additional: 2 December 2016: the publisher has contacted me to apologize, to be honest and to correct the errors, and I think it is possible to give an opportunity to interested friends to see a new version after the error has been corrected.)
0	It's a bad translation.
1	The relationship between Gen-Jing and Choi-Jing has finally made real progress, and the reasons for Choi's earlier actions have come to light in order to find out where he is. Choi-Jing is willing to give up his life for the sake of hiding from Him, but he was shot twice and died.
0	It's the living people who want to see, but it's only the false gods.
0	Hanson's writing is a rat's shit, and he's in the Navy. He's got a wrong name!
0	It turns out how important the cover and review of the book is. It's too bloody.
0	The book should be made into a game or a movie, rather than a novel. The owner's tour of the United States of America is free to pass through a strange upgrade; there are perverts of the size and size of Boss, and the biggest Boss are still alive, and the blood trinkets are two or three times the previous. So it can be a game. The view of slavery and freedom, which looks like the extraordinary country of the Mirrors, is big, and a little bit of black humor is occasionally inserted into it, so that the author will make a film with a model. Most important, the third view is still good, reflecting America's core values, and the Oscar for the good will not be able to reject it. However, as a novel, there is a lack of depth.

0	I don't know why so many people recommend it.
0	The only highlight of this book is Pushkin's poem.
0	It can be said that it's rubbish, it's nothing, it's completely unreadable, and anyone can publish a book these days...

1	It's simple, it's too hard.
0	Copy that.
0	It's not very nice.
0	Translation negative rolls.
0	It's very aggressive. It's very simple. The Bean Pants are not lying to me.
0	Last week, the airport used to go to the bookstore. It was Chen Quan and Han Xian who recommended it. It happened to be a trip. Two pages were turned, and the Left Master's drawings were still so easy. They reread it while he was in a hotel. They fell in love with President Han's logic and life experience. They didn't mean that you could make it out of the two monuments. They needed to feel the culture.
1	The book gives a very profound and detailed account and analysis of why China is urbanizing, why it is urbanizing along with industrialization, how it is urbanizing its population and how it is urbanizing its land.
1	From the perspective of the film industry, there is no human background to the scientific fiction of cold and hard school.
1	The city is a container that melts into the whole ecology.
1	After reading the book that was noted in order to write an article, I wanted to thank the article for the opportunity it gave me.
0	It's a bad translation.
0	It's just like in the old flower stream south wind, of course, that's a lot of names. I can't read this story five years or seven years ago, just for a little girl who has an illusion about love. So it's pretty general. It just uses Tibet as a vehicle to attract people. It's very fine. It's a good picture.
1	This post is part of our special coverage Egypt Protests 2011.
0	For those who think it's a good book, I have a deep sense that we're not reading the same book or not in the same space.
0	It's been a long week, and on a Sunday night, when you want to watch the bl at home at night on your summer vacation, you've got a million words in your head.
1	I'll read it. I'll hide it.
1	The last 100 pages of tears have not stopped... and it is strange that the latest tears have been destroyed.
0	Almost one day, hearing chapter 11, and then trying to pull the author out and boil it. That's the low-class novel of the low-recreation era, and it hasn't been written yet.

1	There is no soul, so there is no need to look back.
1	Be professional, not always emotional.
0	The choice of time on the plane, though somewhat disappointing. Although Mr. Dan Brown is more mature and older in creating tension and advancing a multi-line scenario, the story has no soul — even if he finally moves out of the path of God as a man — and is not able to impress my heart, giving me the impulse to take deep breaths.

0	It doesn't feel so good. The author is still in the prime of his life, with a lot of generalizations and a lot of sticky sentences; and he is ashamed to write in dialects, not sufficiently dynamic, and not as far as vision is concerned. It's not really literature, it's a very well-written diary.

1	This is the fastest book I've ever seen, and every detail is real. I'm sure I'll see it again.
1	A lot of old ideas are worth thinking and thinking about. It's half-reading. There's a great deal of agreement on the conclusions of old money.

1	I'm reading this January 2009 edition, as I always liked it, but why don't you ask your sister, does ISBN want to change it when you reprint it? If it doesn't change, give me a message. How can I pass a note when the same standard number comes out?
0	"The theme for the Five Stars, the combination of disaster, politics, and human love, is just a feeling that the Hong Kong play ""Don't be a Hong Kongman in the Next Life"" and the ""Rounds"" are the context, but, like the hot reviews, ""Let the author write a Story Club,"" and the author was a party journalist, and he only sings praises, and I didn't feel the pain and struggle of people in the great port of escape at all."

1	At any time in your life, anyone who has the idea of a civil servant in politics should take a look at the book and see what happens to someone who has more than one human being, and who has less than one. When you return home, you should recommend to my father and ask for my life.

1	Everyone in their struggle is the same.
1	At last, it took a lot of time to read it, because it was a little more obscure at first. I'm sure the author must be Pagan, because theory used in it was all 20 cs, Lacon, psychiatric.
0	Even after reading it, it really sucks.
0	It's a little light and heavy.
1	No sex is sexy enough. You can feel it, it's even more interesting.
0	The book is not long, it can be finished in two hours. The story is full, but it is not well described, the revenge of the father and the mistrust between the two, and it becomes insignificant after the divorce. It is important to focus on the self-protection of the woman's masters, who do not believe in men because they are weak, and so do the fear. The choice depends on what they want.
1	The core idea is: Uncle Liu's heart is weak, Wei Wu Emperor's hero. After all, the Han Books are full of nonsense, and the triads are full of condescensions... I read too little and I was deceived.
0	It's white enough.
1	The expectation for this book comes more from the trust in the author's writing, which is a text that brings history to life. It feels like it's based on that belief that serious historical facts are viewed in a distance. The world is already so cruel, why not so lightly.
1	I read it at the Trade Library.
1	The new edition is better than this one.
0	By contrast, the man who left Hong Kong this evening is a perfect, pure angel. The book's three-faced.

1	Books are good books.
1	Justice beats evil. It's a faith.
0	I can't do that. I don't know much about capital, I see it in the clouds. Before I was the boss in the industry, I wanted a piece, but the situation was no longer under everyone's control.
0	I don't want this to be my last book of yours.
0	It's not a lot to read. It's a dog's blood. It's not surprising that you're so handsome and handsome, but you're here to pick up young stars and kidnap them. It's not a commercial show.
0	A few better than the sad coffee shop song. It's the most famous one, the translation face I hate most.
1	Life is precious.
1	Psst.
0	Translator sucks. It's the same story.
0	I can't read it at all.
1	Hsiao-hyun's film is a gift to this age. From his film, we can see ourselves, see the times, and be closer to the world. Reading Sea-Boiling Time makes me love Hsiao-hyun even more, and, as he reads, fills up all the movies he did not see before. It's a wonderful journey to find himself and then to understand himself better.
0	It's a general saliva book. Thinking of the Four-Old Books before, it's too much to do.
1	The year '07 marked 'I want to read', when Hiromi turned it all over and liked the sequence of Goo-mi's writing, just to explain what he wanted to say in the back of the memory photo, he said:
1	The plot was interesting, and the character of the male and female masters was encouraging.
0	This one's a little rough...

0	It's basically a 25-27 review. You have to get a little bit of memory on the same day.
0	It's pure black for this motherfucker.
1	It's super fun.
0	I hate conspiracy theory and unrealistic analysis. Negative.
0	What the hell?
1	The book is controversial.
1	One of the most commonly mentioned words is “synthetic error.” Monetary policy is the most effective regulatory tool at the inflation stage, but when there is deflation, monetary policy is rendered ineffective and policy stimuli are required.

1	Perhaps, in the knowledge of Hollywood, people have been stuck on the surface, which makes us yearning for, and the light that it brings out, may be blistering behind them.
1	It's a consistent and non-continuous little story that tells us there's always a way out of China.
1	It's very neat. I think it was bought in the city's monsoon, and now it's gone.
1	"Unlike ordinary movie reviews, every article is used to talk about life in a few movies. Words are simple and warm and imaginative. The end of the article ""The Smell of Autumn Swordfish"": the taste of bitterness, the taste of cheapness, the taste of drink, the taste of life."
1	Listen.

0	Feels like there's no fear for nature, sometimes we're called the “strong country”, glass... the book seems to be particularly evident in this hidden sense of inferiority... whether the giraffe has nothing to do with the shock he himself has... and does not like her sense of superiority!
0	It's ugly. Standard Mary Sue.
1	To be re-read. Especially when you're in love with a movie.
1	Every chapter looks good. It's just too little to hate. But that's it. That's it. It's all there is to be told in a white place. The war came to see Xiaozu's humor and the clarity of fate. Has the war ever affected his shooting? The answer is the positive mud in the mud, the post-war Xiaojin really became the mud in the mud. I've been watching his movies before, and I've known him in the war, and then I've read his words, and I've loved him more than I've ever thought in his heart. 53 movies in my life, The Weeds are 50th, and the last one is the smell of Autumous Fish.
1	It's been two or three months, and it's finally finished. Fine, dark literary works have to be read in order to get into the situation created by the author.
1	Son of a bitch!

0	Translator's like shit.
1	Israel is indeed a remarkable country, especially compared to the Arab countries around it. But the book could mislead a large part of the population, and Israel’s militarization and defeat, and it must not be overstretched.
1	Wang's book looks at people as if they want to take pictures and likes words like this.
1	Compared to the desktop, no deletions have been found.
0	A book goes up to one-fifth, is flat, is boring, is boring, doesn't find any attractions, is completely fluid, and is abandoned. It is decided not to trust the recommendations of the Internet, because it is not clear which readers are real and which are skin-skinned. In fact, the books are good for marketing. In a small range of fans, they are well rated under filters, and authors and fans look happy.
1	After reading the first article, he was shocked by the fact that his novels were a literal illustration of life on the ground. Bad luck, coldness, numbness, and frustration. In Carver's view of life, he had almost a vision of “bad things are about to happen, bad things always happen” and that bad things happen, no one knows what to do, just drink, or stay on the couch, or that the novel ends, and that's even worse.
1	The first half is in the library at the University of Agio, and the second half is on the Kindle.
0	Seeing 14 nights of books, thinking of those Mary Sues who died at the bottom of their hearts and did not hesitate to read over and over again, there was no hesitation. The authors had the idea to transform the picture, to make it more air, to make it more perfect and to make it more efficient. Yet, either the atmosphere is not enough, or the writing is too late, but it is too obstinate. The value of the losers is also the value of the losers. For 14 nights, the pits they dig themselves are filled with tears. If you look at this again in a few years, there may be some reflection. For me, just let me go and do what I want to be.
1	Odyssey in the white darkness. The highness of human nature, the lowness, the weakness, the stench and the tenacity of the soul, the loss and the pursuit. Instead of getting cold in the back, it moves, because what ends is not despicable evil, but faith, hope, love.

0	Shut up! Boring!
1	It's solid.
1	It's so fucking hard to read!
1	It is rare to have one of the layouts and the content of the Xinhua Bookshop in Quanshan to buy it.
1	Nervous, wonderful, ups and downs and downs, simplified and beautiful. A delicate description.
1	In the history of the world, China is inclusive, open.
1	It's a little hiking diary, but it's interesting to read, and it's perfect to read it in the middle of the night when you can't sleep and run a train. This linear narrative, the limitless extension of attention, the connection between the sight and the body, is a hiking.
0	I've given up. It's too hard to read. Let's watch the play.
1	I bought it in high school. I went through it a lot.
1	Well, it's better to have a comparison of the original script.

0	Sci-fi novels should be novels in the end.
0	Not one of the most ugly novels in the world.
0	It's really amateur, and it's getting extreme, but it's good when it's a joke.
0	It doesn't match the publicity.
1	When you're done, you're really dizzy. It's hard to find out that you want to go deep into the kernel of desire just because you want it. Reading, watching movies, playing philosophy, you have to use it to look at your own life, though sometimes it's not worth talking about it.
0	It's full of love.
0	It's very mediocre.
1	English version read
0	It's really ugly.
0	For the year of hastyness, it's like a random story. It's true that the boys and girls in the story are beautiful, rich, and they may have grown up, or lost the feeling of simply appreciating the good story, and they're rarely touched after reading it. This is the one I don't like most in nine-night aphid novels.
1	A lot of good policy advice.
1	The light from another angle.
0	"The author's mood is so strong that there's no merit in it. The more lonely it gets, about two-thirds of it is completely unreadable. The maximum word in the book may be ""man"" or ""woman"" and can imagine the pain of reading."
0	Tell me more about the common sense you know in the second year of junior high.
1	It turns out that will can be freedom beyond humanity.
1	Nice to meet you.
0	Toshino, why don't you go back and write your reasoning?
0	Personally, I think it's a really bad novel.
0	It's much better than a movie, but it's still full of dog blood, and there's a lot of change in style after entry.
0	Words are good, but they're just piled up. The layout's fine, but it's also because the whole story's about the art. It's about the art.
1	1. Not much has been read, because the book has come a long way from the modern economic model, both in time and in form. 2. Endorsement of a country's rapid economic development is closely linked to fewer constraints (and few rules of a small profit group) and more demand. 3. Economics is not a science, but a discipline. 4. The macroeconomic concept of the book makes it difficult for me to go straight.
1	The Western Europe film was picked by the Germans. They had a writer and writer named Karl fork.
0	Tastes like wax.
0	Earlier literature referred to works that could be accepted and loved throughout the world, regardless of race-coloured beliefs, and later, more and more people could only boast of over-interpretation in specific circles, for which I would always be kind - huh.
1	That's right. There's love, there's marriage, there's life and the past.
0	It's a little random for a trip.
1	I couldn't agree more about the relationship between the film and the original. The end of the book was good -- his death wasn't possible, but it was necessary. I think it was really enviable to have it.
1	Expensive.
0	The current account, the diary, the food needed for six months is boring. It's not done, it's not going to be able to see the month of May, it's not going to look better.
0	The clouds are still dead. It's okay. The dogs are bleeding.
0	It's a miracle to have a book like this!
0	I can't even read it anymore.
1	Foughty.
1	The masters choose the readers. Life is a confluence of words, isn't it?
1	I still like him.
0	The translation of this version is hard to swallow.
0	With all due respect, it's nothing. It's over in four hours. It's not as good as his comment on the Chinese voice.
0	The author is too careful to write a novel to be educational, and it turns out it's not the same. That's what's going on. It's a card shop. It's a good idea.
0	I am the Pharaoh of Egypt,
0	I don't know how to write.
1	It's a good writing, though the man's a bit of an asshole.
1	After that, it felt better than the horse, the Xie translation, the English translation and the original text were still to be read.
0	Read a little more about popular readings. The bright spot is the confluence of imagination. The drawback is language, logic, and character. And when the summer of lunch is over, the spring and evening bragging is on fire.
1	That's a good yellow cover, Les.
0	I hate watching the DPD fight.
1	The final chapter is the best.
0	I don't know. I don't like it.
0	The theory of looting in the name of freedom. Of course, the Fays theory isn't useless, it was for three stars, it's too trashy for a translator, it's two more stars.
0	That's a good idea.
0	It's a mess. It's a pity for the fine drawings. And, uh, turn the mountain.
0	It's really disgusting to look at the three countries and think about the book again.
1	Tiny.
1	You have to read the series.
0	"Not good. The encyclopedia of encyclopedia entries doesn't deserve to be called ""historical history."""
0	It's nothing. It's a random trip. It's so expensive.
1	Nai said...
0	Except for a half-life, the rest of Eileen is ignoring.
1	Both novels and films are worth looking at. But the details of novels can be much better, different from the scripts.
0	I can't watch anymore.
0	It's attracted by a good beginning, because it's the same confusion, running away, looking for itself, but it's disappointed with the way a book describes a man's diary, but it's like a 30-year-old writing a diary like a high school student, and it's a little childish and self-satisfying.
1	It's too professional for me as an outsider, but it's possible to look at the list after the book, explaining many of the terms that are often found in film reviews such as “Leave” and “Mountage” and “Long shot”.
1	Deeply shallow, coupled with examples, short words. The first part of the process takes time to rewrite every memory I learn, and the second part of the knowledge is a little rusty.
1	When someone finishes the novel and wonders how dark the true human nature is, it's the fact that everyone doesn't want to be seen, rips off the moral veil, and everybody's rudeness. In Pascal's words, people have intellectual reeds. When they can't get fed up, it's not normal for the animal to be exposed. Who cares if it doesn't see reason and dignity? The genetics of the creature are self-serving, and the will to survive dominate the human race from ancient times to the present.
1	Tears are the last means of communication. No conversation is possible, but even so, should we try it?
0	The raider was just a thief.
0	20100729
0	That's the time. It's very simple.
1	The gunpowder is focused on the idea of socialism, but it is also a human disease. It is the ability of the reader to have a strong sense of introspection, the fictional protagonist to become a true self-proclaimer, and self-analysing the blade to see the blood.
1	Pain is your wealth.
0	A woman's character is real, not as noble as those women, and that's what real life is like.
1	Readability is great, the content of books is excellent, and even the names of male and female masters are their own.
1	Beautiful.
0	Don't read the book, Day and Day.
1	I'm impressed.
0	First person
1	"It's like every writer in the script is talking about ""The Thousand Hero."" The next one's going to read this."
0	It's water and it's basically blind, bb.
0	It's boring.
1	Using geopolitical architecture as a narrative perspective, historical geography as a way of dissolving textual narratives. As the author said, “through this perspective, we have gained a possibility to look at changes in the nature of empires.”
1	This biography is very interesting.
1	100,000 litres of tears and a long, long life.
1	It would be helpful if you wanted to write a story with no merit in the rules. If you wanted to write a story that was amazing, you had to have a depth of thought.
1	Let's use the current popular language: it's not a story, it's loneliness!
0	Being accustomed to a situation of despair is worse than a situation of despair per se.
1	Writer's trip.
1	To be honest, it's not much!
1	It is clear from this that the definition of a small government is not less to talk about, but less to deal with than it should be. A series of measures have been taken at the top of the US to avoid a financial crisis and, in the wake of the crisis, various bills have been put in place.
0	It's not a book of travels in the true sense of what I think. Perhaps the author's personality is so fragile that the whole trip of the book is just like the way she talks about her grief, so I don't have any of the pleasures of being so far away throughout the reading process. Not very much.
0	Don's got nothing to say. May the wind blow over and blow away 10 miles of peaches.
1	It's far and wide. History must now take into account the results of research in other fields, particularly in the natural sciences, so as to give a higher perspective to the history of human formation and development.
0	It's the first book I can't even read.
1	Hailey Library
0	It's just China's history, in fact, only the Spring and Fall Wars and Chu Han, and it's more appropriate to change the title to half an hour of comics. It's perfect for children to read, and for those who don't want to read history and want to brag.
0	We do not want to repeat the third time, and we do not yet have the capacity to maintain the proper version, but the dignity of the attack must not be lost.
0	The front desk is bored, because the breaks seem to be suitable only for leisure. Friends and neighbors say that the book was read out of the lingering belief that “believing this author is more than that”, but in fact I still don't see any flashpoint until the end of the day. Now, it's time to play two stars.
1	Sergio.
0	Custamers.
1	The ancient emperors of China are not dictators, and the emperors are bound by His Majesty's authority.
1	It's a novel, though.
0	"I don't give two stars because it's bad, if it's a novel alone, it's 70-80 points, but if it's a hymn, it's bad. The story can't be good, the characters can't be rich, but I just feel that it's not written with heart or emotion, and it's just written around an inexplicable set-up called ""Sophie Love O'Yon"". It's just a quick-food novel."
1	Two-by-five worlds.
1	It's a good book. It's basically a critical depiction of the city's historical development.

1	Since it was an interview rather than an academic dissertation, it did not go far enough. The focus on Piara and Kasovitz, especially by Piara, was a surprise.
0	The second-chicks and the second-chicks. The second-chicks and the second-chicks. The second-chicks and the second-chicks. The second-chicks and the second-chicks and the second-chicks of the kings, when they end up out there, are they moral and principled?
1	Look at this book and listen to Eric.
1	Writers are crafts, not art; if they cannot be filmed (buildings), script writing (design drawings) will be meaningless.
0	It's almost all the expressions I don't like. It's a little bit interesting after the palace.
1	Tell me the truth.
1	Nothing. But there was.
1	Read it word for word and write a book review.
0	The text on the chart is too large to affect its intuitiveness.
0	The author has worked hard to explain the serious problems of the current economic system and to urge government reform, and does not want to think about how hard it would be to cut taxes, increase local fiscal revenues, and convert the already marketed UNESCO weight into welfare. The TUC is not a Democratic Party, the Chinese government is not a financial team, socialism is not capitalism, and it is ours that the government breaks free exchange rates.
0	It's a novel that's enough to lower the overall level of the song.
1	I fear that there will be no opportunity to choose what I really like. It is a simple book. There is no big reason. There is nothing strange about it. The author’s words remind me of all the trips that have taken place before, real, ordinary, fresh memories. Traveling is always more familiar, more understood, and more aware of what I need. Traveling is only to come back, and there is more choice. Like the author’s touch in the last chapter, all the stories on the way are just a beautiful part of life. Those who know, encounter, enrich our lives, and make us more aware of our lives. And, similarly, our courage is affecting others, making the people around us rich. Let’s do it. Whether young or not, we need the opportunity to choose the life we want.
1	It's finished. It's been a long day. I've been trying to read. I don't want to do anything.
1	Stranger books.
1	Jajonko has analysed his film so thoroughly that it can be seen in the book that he is deeply worried about the rapid development of society, that he is trying to find his pace through the film, which is different from the rhythm of the big picture of profit-only images, which, as the cover says, is the way he leads to freedom.
0	I've read this intimeout, it's a column set. It's like it's tickling in the boots, it's not going to hit the point, it's obviously advertising.
0	It's not very detailed. It's a terrible script.
0	I don't know if it's a question of translation.
0	It's such a pain in the ass on the cover. The translator's dead.
0	There's nothing worth looking at!
0	Why don't you go back and read Zhang's book for half a day? You can't be a cow from overseas Chinese history!
1	Looked at five of the same series of films the previous two days, and then went on to this series of history books. This is an explanation of the Middle East problem from the source.

1	Top.
1	Shake it.
1	The book can't be reprinted.
0	Personally, it's boring.
0	It's like a run-off account for junior high school students.
0	It's a terrible story.
1	“They do not want to forget, and most importantly, they do not want the world to forget, because they understand that their experiences are not meaningless and that the concentration camps are not an accident or an unforeseen historical coincidence.” War is over. War is just beginning.
0	This is a concept that deserves to be understood: it's about being sufficiently aware of and prepared for risk; it's all about wind control. The whole book is scattered and I'm finished. And it's been a long time. I don't think it's worth taking much time to read it.
1	It's good. It's better than a novel.
1	It's a benefit. Just waiting for the book on the safe to come out of the book.
0	That's enough for once. It's getting boring.
0	The Girls' Revolution
1	It's very useful, and it's very useful to see a film in a recent state, and it's useful to see a review. It's a different film review, which, after all, is used as a textbook, and each case is advanced by a theory, which then analyses the beauty of the film through a theoretical layer.
0	My black history.
1	It's also a professional request.
1	"After the story of Bath, called ""A Little Good One"" in the Cathedral, Carver rewrites the end in particular, and the story is more focused and begins to redeem itself. For example, in ""What are we talking about when we talk about love"" Carver also likes to set up some open-minded acupunctures, smart little ones, and in the Cathedral the sound of the extraterrestrials is like those religious rituals that fall into the real cathedral. I can never understand religion, they are too sacred to me, but I love their mystery, and they touch me from time to time when I think it's time to wash the lead."
0	Many of the concepts, the translation of titles and the versions now in use are not quite the same.

1	It's easy to understand. It's awesome!
1	It's a life of sorrow and joy. Vivian's life cannot be decided by himself, but we can be more tolerant about our lives. Keep your spirits up.
1	Some of them were selected. Some: (i) the artistic value of the Mountain Legend was sorted out in the memory images. (ii) there was a sense of the importance of the role and role of “datashops.” (iii) there was interest in earlier Chinese films such as “Spring of Small Cities”.
0	I'm drunk. Why can't the bean petals brush the negative centipede?
0	"After reading ""Change Mountain"" it seems that Taiwan youth are still very determined and intriguing, and it may be that Taiwan, after years as a Japanese colony, is culturally clearly influenced by Japan, but has no connection with the mainland and a little bit in the middle. To be honest, there is a general feeling that the text is diaphragm, small capital + stacks, and as a traveler on a bicycle, it is not as good as ""Don't die."""
0	At first, I looked at it, and then I found out it wasn't my type, and the grass turned to the end of the book.
0	What's so good about this three-faced novel? A boy and a girl born three days ago, the author must be a big, dark girl. Did you get the pickles from the kids' school tomorrow morning?
0	"I'm probably never going to be able to appreciate the novel, and there's only one thing in the whole story: ""That night I learned what love is."""
1	The popular book, which describes the concepts involved in the various financial statements, provides more inspiration in the latter part, where the three tables are linked together to project the image of the enterprise.
1	Psychopsychologically dichotomy. Sometimes it feels like I'm me.
1	It's painful to be calm.
1	The language of calm and restraint is often more powerful.
0	Fake's gonna die.
1	Hashimoto's plays, the creative methods and the writing of the scripts with gossip, are very useful. Writing is so powerful, no one gets out of the way, it's too heavy, it's easy to write unnaturally, as the second half of the book is so grossly misrepresented. The small country's evaluation of Hashimoto is at stake, but the latter's reflection is not enough.
1	I'm grateful for a month of constant dream integration, and I must put the spirit of 4 a.m. into every burning burn.
0	It's all the same in the snow.
1	It's like a novel with Prussia as the only lead, and it's going to fall and fall, and it's going to end up in love with a country that's been drawn to Europe like a meteor.
1	In fact, I want to give 3.5 stars. There are a lot of subheadings and chapters that are not very logical and translated, but it seems that authors, when they are journalists, are exposed to the same circumstances that many scholars are unable to reach. The two decades of bubble bankruptcy, while losing a few simple and tight events and attitudes, shows that the Japanese government and bureaucrats are responsible for the collapse of the bubble economy.

1	Put on a teacher's style.
0	We don't like this style, and there's a lot to argue about it.
0	A lost book, with a super-high score of 9.1 in the bean petals, is it because of a great translator? It doesn't feel as good as a translator? The whole book has a lot of clues, chaos, a lot of information, a lot of nonsense about what kind of mediocre Jewish spy is going on (who's interested in them?), nausea, East Lacey, the leading actor Lawrence is only about a third of the content, and he's over-the-counter war, and he seems to have only a few of his most concerns.
1	"The movie is about winning and losing. A lot of people think they're killing people if they don't move, but it's just an accident. Can you just make a good story with the sound of ""Is that right?"" The most fundamental thing about the camera is to think deeply about things, to get back to humanity's rich love... and to say that human nature may be too abstract and warm. I think that's how to put this warmth perfectly on the screen."
1	Finally, it's a history of relations between Tang Qing and the center. Han Xing became the new hero of life, and he took charge of the world's bread, salt and iron, and also drew the famous Five Bull Map.
1	Filming is a technical job.
0	All kinds of chaos and all kinds of weird dramas!
0	The main thrust of the book can be summarized in a sentence on page 15 of the text: in fact, Ottoman rule is very beneficial to farmers.
0	The cloud cover, it's not as wonderful as it's described.
0	General
1	Carver has enough sense of a weak beating heart in a world of solitude, and has the ability to visualize it accurately. He's a very, very, very good text-director, exceptionally calm and gentle.
1	It's good to compare it to the history of the West and the surrounding countries.
0	The narrative, the language, it's like the Duras, but it's bad.
1	The old man's problem was not one of “fault”, and he simply admitted that “caught a crow in a tree and that it was never possible to do it”, that he did not understand that the “crunch” was a sin in itself and that he had not been “arrested” in the first place.
1	Human interaction, we talk about emotion, reason, and faith. And when we get to the collective level, it's like there's only interest left. The economy determines a lot of things.
1	Short
0	Let me borrow Mr. Yang's words: How can anyone write history like this?
0	This book has lost Wu Xiaobo's standard.
1	The scene has been reversed for a while. The disadvantage is that the amount of information is really small. btw, most of it was seen a few years ago.
1	My hands were shaking when I read the book.
0	Disappointment, skepticism and Seven Senses are not authors. One more star, because the author's signature version was bought.
0	Conspiracy is bullshit.
0	No book has yet been given a star. The first one. It is even stronger that the palace should not be seen, and the palace should not be seen, and the palace should not be seen, and the royal family should not be seen. What is the dream of a red house, to learn a style of literature, and nothing more? The author is a total pervert to write such a sick, repetitive, and incorruptible story. And a king of the Mary Sue River, who, after having been happy, is bored with hypocrisy. When he sees the beginning of the sixth book, he doesn't read it, and Mark will never touch it again.
0	I can't believe they're so fucking high on books that they don't read it.

0	Traveling chicken soup. New books flipped. Still too young, a little empty, maybe too old for me.
0	I can't see it anymore!
0	What's this written about? Are they all sailors?
0	The novel promotes compliance with the words “what results from what has been done” rather than “what has been done in order to bring about it.” The novel deliberately creates events and conflicts in pursuit of sharp contradictions and shocks, with the result that the author's artificial interference is too heavy, the “situations” are too strong, and everyone in the novel has been created by the camp as a doll “to contribute to the development of the plot”.
1	It's simple and frivolous, but it's dark, and all these novels can be filmed, and it goes beyond the original, theatrical.
1	These days, just looking at the 1970s, a guy called Xu Xiao Gang found a lot of representation in the book. He went back and retraced it. He was sent to the mountains to learn the truth that he was not supposed to say. He was probably a good learner, he studied his own university math and electronic engineering, and he invented an auto-called heavy-packer farmer friend who said that Africa’s friends were using it. It was also a wonder that reform was open, and he went to Harvard to study political and economic studies, and learned a lot of paper and carried a bunch of scary titles.
1	It's a long time ago. It's a long time ago. It's a long time ago.
0	It's not as cultural as I expected it to be.
1	Read it in one breath on the return flight, similar to the views of many, and slightly less film than the original.
0	It's not my food. I don't know why it's so hot.
1	If you're interested in history, you don't get bored.
1	No five stars are sorry about its length and breadth.
1	In the answer to “How do we explain Nazi madness against Jews?” the author wrote: So we must have doubts about those who try to convince us by argument, not by reason, and must be suspicious of what we call “the most attractive leaders.” We must be careful not to let the judgment and will of others be our judgement and will. Because it is difficult to distinguish between the true truths of the prophet, we should also have doubts about all the prophecies. We better abandon the “truths” that have been shown, even if they are glorified, and we must be as proud as we can be. We must be sure of the more conservative, less exciting truths.

0	It's really hard to write.
0	You want to change the world by a milligram, but look at it as if it's a monkey face. It's really boring. It's three stars to take it off. I personally find it very damaging to my ability to write novels.
0	Have.
0	Despite a story about power and power, the heroine's haze is still blind, but the main function of Internet fiction is to meet the needs of readers. Moreover, it's a hooliganism to break down stories that can be put in one chapter into a few small chapters.
0	The example of prices is clear and so many difficult cases are grouped together, but some are scattered and more like a manual.
1	Colm Tobin's book, unmatched.
1	It's very useful to understand Xiaotsu's film! It's a great translator, it's a bit of translator, it's almost finished.
0	When I look at the beginning, I want to leave.
0	It's too much of a tune.
0	I can't believe it's written by the same author, the man is a dirty cucumber, the woman sleeps with her concubine, the woman doesn't care.
1	The Langluva section is crying too much.
1	Looks like it's a little faster.
0	It's basically the level of the World of Normality.
1	There's only one regret: when I leave, there are so many things that are still going on, like half of a sudden interruption in a long novel. In the last few decades, the world has changed so much, things have happened so much, and when I die, it's a big regret that the world will not continue to change and things will continue to happen. Frankly, I hate the press, but every 10 years after I die, I'll climb out of the grave, go out and buy some newspapers, wrap them up, sneak back into my grave in silence, read them before another long sleep, and know what the world's been going through, and I'm lying in my coffin, safe and comfortable.
1	It's like some kind of movie that I like, without deliberate bitterness, but rather a concise and practical description of the recent fictional class that touched me the most.p.s. really wanted to see it made into a movie!
1	It's beautiful! You guys are so gay! I want to see the picture!

1	In the first book of 2014, Xiaotsu wrote the essay with a typical archer who left it unattended.
1	The movie's visualization.
1	To Henry James. In the memories of novelists, it is impossible to distinguish between fiction and real life what is real and what is not. For 10 days, the book looks at a chapter every day, and although the whole book looks like a routine memory, a patchwork of consciousness, the author writes only about the most important visits in his life: sister Alice, cousin Minnie, confidant and sister-in-law.
0	No wonder there's a lot of illiterate people in these circles. The audio-visuals are just technical. They don't have to do with the flowers. They can easily force the X. From another angle, they also show the complexity and shallowness of the film grammar itself.
1	This encyclopedia of Manford outlines the main contours of human urban development, which is actually the history of human civilization, in which many of the phenomena in modern cities can find their roots. The translation of the book, although slightly flawed in some names and geographical names, is difficult for the translator, given the great knowledge of the original author.
1	Yesterday on the bus, the layout of the book makes it look like a fairy tale, but it's an emotional novel about the father, and if I read it earlier, maybe I'll be able to rewrite it.
0	I can't really see the flow of consciousness.
0	It's important. This book tells me what I hate.
1	Ha! Says it's a piece of junk to kick the ass.
0	And then it turned out to be all right.
0	The author is getting worse and worse.
1	“A scholar’s success, a personal effort, is very important, but in society, people are a member of society, and no matter how powerful you are, you can’t stand the tide of this society. It is only in this tide that your personal role can emerge... and so can the great heroes.”

0	It's too theoretical.
0	Listening to The History of Xu Jianxyun, it's like a party's proclaiming department.
0	I can't see it at all... it's all hard.
1	Although the fine part of the book is probably only about five pages of paper, it's hard to hold up a book. But that's the fineness of these five pages of editing, which takes the authors many years to explore. It's also worth reading. It reveals the underlying principles of editing.
0	"It's hard to swallow the high gestures of the word ""this is the best."""
0	Logical confusion.
1	It is more detailed than Thirty Years of Extremism.
1	“I believe in the growth of the audience, and I think that the time has come to go to the cinema in order to be bored for two hours. The viewers come a little closer to the novel reader... The viewers do not go to the cinema to sleep, but rather to go to the cinema, and they should sleep the night before.” Mr. Oshima overestimated the audience and looked at the movies, like an ancient civilization that is bright and glorious, and artistic films are slowly disappearing and dying.
1	I have a problem with that.
0	The translator sucks.
0	It's hard to see the last page when you insist on thinking what's going on. What the book is doing is trying to tie the headlines together.
0	What's most striking is that the owner's money and money — the desktop manipulation makes the text that was supposed to be a tragedy particularly ridiculous, and you let the C.I.A. take the novels as evidence?
1	You have to watch the movie seriously.
0	If the author really abandons this country, the truth is that the author has absolutely no pen to feel the nation's might from his heart, that one star is for the man, and that part of the job is completely unknowing, boring...

0	It's the first time I've ever touched a book.
0	How do you say? There's a lot of things that aren't clear, and logic is not clear. It's just that the heart doesn't work, and it doesn't look good. It's time to look at New Star's AV Image History, which is the rhythm of serious history.

1	I don't know the history of the Republic, the economics and the shallowness of it. I'll read a few more books.
0	I don't like it when I look at it. I don't like it when I look at it. It's the beginning of a youth story... but it's still all over... because it's really ugly, and now the ad that sells books is really... just like a shampoo ad.
0	It's a social news collection.
1	The best one in a bunch of secondhand books.
0	It's a lesson to read: 1; read or read; 2; learn what a good book is. P.s. Sorry, class.
0	It's not good-looking. Even though it's never been a real story, it's ridiculous. Is your video and photo inspired by Mr. Chen's story? The book was published in 2007, and the teacher's perception of homosexuality is still old.
1	University read the book, remembering the freshness and curiosity and the sense of identity at the time. Of course, there are many places that are not. It needs to be included in the next list of books to be read in detail.
0	It's like a list of famous people from the Injun years, one, two, three, four, four, and so on, and it's kind of a story.

0	Soft science fiction is like a tough guy's society.
0	It's a good idea for authors to win a Nobel Prize, but what does it say? It's a waste of time to go to a textbook, and we're old enough to read it. If we're interested in a new field, let's look at a textbook.
1	This book is an excellent reading of the Knights of the Hospitals, a detailed, concise, and highly recommended. From the history of the Order’s heroic battles and the philanthropy of recent years, this ancient organization of monks is truly worthy of respect.

1	Portugal began to explore sea-borne spices (80% of Caricat's peppers), and Venice merchants were very worried that the transfer of power could not be stopped. Columbus went to America. The two kings of West Portuguese and Spanish drew a line on the map that divided the world. Magellan thought from a map in the national vault that there was a channel that could cross the Americas, but wrongly estimated the size of the Pacific Ocean that led to the loss of the channel for five months.

1	This book brings me to see a man who, because of love, has changed his whole life, dares to ask who can do so now for the one he loves? Although it is an ancient Rome that has gone down the stage of history, Christianity has begun to take on the historical grand picture of Western domination, but I see more love than religion! This comment is dedicated to my friends who have devoted themselves to the silent service of those they love!
1	It's not bad. Song Dynasty is a popular dynasty.
0	I can't understand what the author's trying to say.

1	If the bare wall were to be filmed in the script of the reed, it would be much better to look much better, but it would be more than just how to write it, and there would be some logic to be taught. Although views are more personal, or even somewhat biased, they are not all right, but very reed-like.

1	It's a skill stream. It's not as exciting as Story, but it's very practical.
1	It's an important part of the paper. Knowing the different aspects of Siujin on the battlefield, there's a lot of people who comment on the “perverted” passages of his war life, wondering where these conclusions come from, and the real nausea may be contained in another non-public journal, but the excerpts are taken to show a young man with a unique vision and a strong personality.

1	I'm so scared that Tlüfer's going through a lot of movies. I haven't seen a lot of movies.

The Madonna line said, ""Your mother calls for guilt and conscience."" Then the man beats the treacherous man, saves the woman, and then tries three more times, and every time she's in love, she says, ""Oh, no, don't touch me."" The adage says, ""I've taken my pants off, you see this!"" I can't stand it."
0	I think it's a failure, but there's a lot of patrons.
0	He said that the problem was not that women were not male smart or mathematically competent: he had recruited women in some initial jobs, and their technical proficiency was just as good as that of men. The problem was that they had not been given a “bee mag”: “They had no killer instincts, they didn't want to fight, they didn't want to attack each other's vitals.” He gave an example of that: when he told a female subordinate that she had made a mistake, she fell in tears. “You'll never win that way.”
0	When a man is rich and rich and rich, he wants to meet a good-looking, good-looking, wise-looking man to return to rich and beautiful. He turns his back on his wife, picks up a lot of charges against his wife, then divorces him and treats him like an adulterer.
1	Commentators clashed with the directors'minds, turned sparks into stars, and were able to experience a beautiful encounter under that star.
1	A book for readers at all levels that is “appreciated” to read.
1	After a few hours of schooling, it turns out, as many women writers have written, that they use marriage to prove their worth, and that a divorced woman can find a better one. It's good to have a single and happy book.
1	The documentary is made by the best directors and makes the least money.

1	1. Indian politicians are bad, portraying peace with the outside world, promoting dialogue and, in fact, completely ignoring each other's claims;
0	The author's aesthetics are contrary to me. It's disgusting that a bad old man, an old man, who takes a baby from a nephew, who doesn't think he's ashamed or proud! Objectively, novels are good, sort of like high-test writings or Oscar's best foreign language films. But the style is dirty and speculations.

0	It's a sick book written by a poor man for lack of knowledge about the opposite sex.

0	He's trying hard. He's got no talent.
1	The movie is about winning and losing, and so is life.
1	It's almost read out. It's full of decomposition and staleness. It's all traces of time and frustration.
0	There is no research paradigm. There are too many artificial trade-offs.
0	I'm disappointed. There's no new features.
1	The most important thing is that Mrs. Cheung Lin, I think you've experienced all kinds of suffering, how can there be such a man? In the end, people need a soul to live.

0	It's better up there than down there, but it's not as good as ever.
1	It seems that a group of people are doing the ideal thing. Some things have come up with the right answers. But the director himself has my own consciousness, no direction, no imposition, withdrawal of the director's role, and more pleasure in seeing the audience react to the film. North Village's evaluation, life flow, has raised his storybook to the height of film narratives. Ioji, restraint of emotions, fermentation details, and good sense. Now think about some regret reading the book, knowing that he sometimes gives his own unnamed self-confidence to judge.
0	The author does not really know much about history. For example, the author says that the first heir to the throne should be his uncle, the King of Switzerland, in the absence of a queen, who knows that he has no knowledge of the ancient common sense of the first-born inheritance system; the author also explains that the Emperor did not leave any portraits of the Emperor but only of the writings and Hiroshi, but neither of them, and that the statues he has now seen are actually of the father of gentrification, the pseudos of the present.
0	Chen Wan and Qin Yuan remind me of Kim Yanxi and Qing Autumn. A beautiful, bright, proud and unconscionable experience, such a girl often seems to be the toughest and sometimes the saddest woman ever to be happy. But a person doesn't like Qin.
0	It's not easy for amateurs to read about large-scale advertising.
0	Randomity is ultimately just anti-knowledge, the world is hidden in fog, and the appearance is fooling us. Just look at chapters III, IV and conclusions. The rest is a waste of life bullshit!
1	All those who want to write about Song Dynasty will kill themselves.
0	"Only one of them, "" Staying while alive "". In keeping with the tradition of reading that has been developed for so long, it is reasonable to have considerable respect for masters'works. Even if you don't appreciate them, it's just to keep it in your heart, even when you see most people's comments on books quite high, you can't appreciate them."

0	It's too watery.
0	That's it. I can't stand this guy. What's a bunch of royal officers saying about a eunuch? What's a eunuch always calling himself a slave?
0	Is this the story and the thought of a few kids?
0	Big stories are small stories, extraneous stories. It's not the big part of grand narratives. It's not the character of the person that drives the plot, it's the logic of the author being a bit far-fetched.
1	Wang Dynasty recommends the Bible of Western writers. The perspective of hero travel is enlightening.
0	A few short deductions, a female teacher came together. It was like I saw Detective Conan.
1	It's a shock!
0	This is obviously too much bullshit to compose. 2016.6.17.
0	N.
1	It's a step forward. From ancient times to the present, it's as comprehensive as possible. The first edition is a bit confusing, not knowing whether it's a translation or something. We're going to study the second edition of World Film History.
0	It's very annoying to be a writer.
1	Magnificent! This is the best historical novel I've ever seen. It's a great recommendation.
1	It's amazing. It's too sad to read in the middle of the road. Has it really been a thousand years since Song In-song's death?
1	I couldn't wait for another great movie, I bought it, I got disappointed, I used paper, I had bad layouts, especially when I got a great movie, and I was blown up.
1	I didn't think the library would find such a good book!
0	I'm really disappointed... that the title of the book is like the opening of the book, and it turns out that it's more like the first seven or the last place to die.
0	N.
0	Instead of talking about life-philosophical thinking, which is shallow and not like Braddock, writing about some people's nature with a scruples of detective reasoning, it's profound.
0	Actually, I didn't finish it.
1	It's been a long time, and it's finally over. It's not about historical events, it's about economic and cultural ideas, and so on, and it's still interesting.
1	It's hard to buy a book. 60 bucks will have to buy a copy. The lines in it are so exciting.
0	I hate ladies.
0	I saw it with my brother's song and Ming's song. I found myself very picky about the standard of novels, and I found myself obnoxious about the story!
1	I can't look at it. I want to see it again. It's not funny, but it's so interesting.
1	The Chinese-language film history of the Chai teacher, my achievement was to clear up the work of the representatives of the various generations of filmmen, like Sun Yo, Xie Jin and others, to focus on the director, as well as two film reviews with deep personal feelings on the street, which will be seen many times in the future.
0	Although I'm pandering, I don't like it.
0	I didn't say anything. Gon was recommended for the movie.
0	Actually, it's not true.
0	Can we not have a hybrid translator? Can we?
1	Genius. More genius than sarcasm and sharpness.
1	It's finally finished. It's about people who have been tortured by life, who have died of love, who are repeating themselves every day, and who are on the verge of collapse. I think it's more than a few times because I can still read it now.
1	The introduction was good, and the basic concept was clear, but some examples were too noisy to analyse, some were too jumpy to read and there was no answer to the question after school.
1	The focus on the unpublished `China article' on the mainland is no wonder it was cut off.
1	It's a solid experience. I'm looking forward to the show.
0	The book is far from objective, and the data cited do not support the argument; rather, it has very strong personal preferences. A very irresponsible piece of paper.

1	I often dream of the vision of the future, of the role that I might be, perhaps a poet, a prophet, a painter, and so on. But these are nothing. I do not exist for poetry, prophecy or painting. No one should live for that. These are nothing but the end of the line. For everyone, there is only one real responsibility: to find himself.

0	Looking at the commentary and the foreword, there were high expectations for the book. But if you had been to Europe, ask you to stay away from it. The background of the author’s writing is Europe in the 1990’s, and even if it were so relented, the author’s writing remains useless. It's like trying to persuade people to leave their homes or give some comfort to those who have never gone far.
1	Looking back: Until true democratic freedom is achieved, all the students are a tragic fate.
0	Time out.
1	Looked at the author's thoughts on the history of the book, and was moved, and he was able to get a study from the undergraduate level to a doctoral degree, to a certain extent, as a matter of happiness. Support!

0	Insulting IQ.
1	That was a great speech.
1	The factors and criteria defined by the author in this book can be read several times. The study of the history of politics or, further, the paradigm of historical political geography, the most famous of which is, of course, the “street form” and the “dog-tooth error.” It is rare to talk about the evolution of the Qing district in such a short space.
0	Not really... isn't it good for Everzheng? It's a good name. It's a good name.
1	This book describes Israeli entrepreneurship in the form of storytelling.
1	There were a lot of books in primary school, but there was very little to read, and the two jigs and shouts from the People's Literary Press were almost ruined by me, and the story was as good as a fairy tale!
0	It's boring. The tongues of the perjury are dumber than the tongues of the pseudo-testing, and it is the hearts of those who see things.
1	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
0	The whole book is made up of small pieces, mainly remembering the past, the graces, some of the elders, and so on. And I look at the door in the palace, which is only a small part of the book, and it is a bit of a trickery, or one of the most recent thefts of the palace.
0	There are too many inconsistencies in this book!
0	"Well, it's still ""Norwegian Forest,"" but it's not a compliment."
0	For the reason of the translator, the statement is always lacking in emotion and colour. There are many errors. Too much storytelling, trying to add more detail in the way of a forward review, becomes cumbersome and counterproductive.
1	Not only to pay tribute to Ms. Jang, but also to the great effort and effort of the author to make the book a wake-up call for the world. Bean petals are a bit unpopular, and the book is not even visible on the high ranking list. Is it artificial? What's going on, it should be seen by the Chinese.
0	It's too slow.
0	I don't know what he's talking about, and I don't know what the author's saying has to do with the subject. It's a typical drop in the bag, it's not consistent, it's more loose than the pen, it's like talking to you, it's over. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Think about it.
1	During the course of the study
0	The clues are spread out, but it's a mess, too heavy to be carved together, the motive for the crime is superficial, the suspicion and the crime are not good. All of them, they're all on the second one, but I don't think it's worth the time to look at the second one. The poems are good. That's great. What does it have to do with the map?
1	I read it in my second year. I remember it very well.
1	It would have been better if you'd read the book, which was so good that the author's subjective feelings were too strong; now think again, it would have been better if all the books had been smooth without a bit of emotional fluctuations.
1	Not bad, but at the end of the day, I didn't like it.
0	I also think that writing a very heavy topic into a story fair is one of the abilities that the organization has developed for journalists.
0	Maybe I'm incompetent. I always think it's a translation. I can't read adjectives when I'm in a line.
1	The bookstore seemed to be less interested in the bookstore than it was in the past, and Grandpa asked me to buy the book. So the flips were like jumping into the space that was long before us, and it was strange to say that the shadows became clearer. We all lived in our childhood, and he kept running away from us. It was valuable to have the heart of a naked son.
1	Except for the last part, it's a good reading. Speaking of culture, it's always the family.
0	Time out. She likes to be so hot, the words are fine.
0	It's not a good translation.
1	Classic!
1	"A week. It's not a perfect book. It's not even true for the cost of writing. But it's a great book. It's great enough by 800 pages alone. It's just a contemporary book called ""Morco-Berodo"" -- a cancer-like novel. The narrative is boundlessly divided, producing an infinite amount of fruit and dividing it again."
1	Franny.
1	On four sides, the enemy’s bullet fields created the Israeli tradition of travelling away from repression from small, militarized thinking and preferences. On average, the Israelis who traveled 13 countries before 35 years of age, arguing: walk a little longer, stop a little further, see a little more. And everyone in the country, up to the prime minister, has nicknames, flattening management, equal democracy, and a “hardening” discussion of things, compared to the most innovative Americans. There are many innovative start-ups, apart from cultural and social reasons, and mechanisms and capital elements, especially the latter, the Israeli government-led windfall fund Yozma.
1	It's been a long time since you read a non-constructive reading.
1	It's a lot of dry stuff. Even if I didn't want to be a writer, I'd read it a lot. It's like talking to a movie star. It's fun.
0	I don't like it.
0	It's nice to see you die. That's all.
0	It's the worst translation I've ever read.
0	It's very bad.
1	The first one-third of them are beautiful, and they forget to listen to the original purpose of the script, and they're immersed in the history of the Western Film Factory, before and after Bing's creation, in the name of the past, etc.; they admire the ideas of the then Western Shadows and the idea that some of the directors are responsible for making money, some of them are responsible for making money, some of the art films are responsible for winning prizes, some of them have a rational set-up, and each of them has their own responsibilities; the play of the Du Moon is spoken with great interest, and they ask anyone who can take the film; the pen has gone into private conversations, and it has become a streaming account of the views of the art of the reed; but it should be said that the whole book has been read and the reading process has been interesting.
1	In some moments, I forgot whether it was Paul's own novel or btr's story.
0	Weaving for the web.
0	Read four chapters, give up, don't like this narrative style, it's a little confusing, maybe the translation's out of order. Anyway, you don't feel the pleasure of reading, you give up.

1	Basic understanding of the recession in Japan, but more often than not, some assumptions about how macroeconomicly complex it is.
1	When I read this book, I couldn't stop reading it. I just thought it was great, and I was happy when I met it.
1	This book has enabled me to be extremely enlightening in many of my questions about ancient Chinese society; Kim has demonstrated China’s unique super-stabilized structure with a rigorous logic that gives me the pleasure of thinking. It is also one of the most recent books I have ever taken.

0	It's bad enough, but it doesn't touch me at all, and it doesn't shock me. Well, why come out of an orphanage? To find a father? Even so, there's no way to find him. It's like he came out of an orphanage to suffer. How can he do that?

1	Now it's a little hard to read textbooks. It's kind of like a basic book for studying big history. Big history is about the whole universe, and everything that happens in it can fit into it. It's new, and it's the most comprehensive. It's amazing.

1	At the beginning of the nineteenth century, with Russia expanding southwards into the heart of Central Asia, British India expanding northwards into Kashmir, the two great empires gradually showed a collision dynamic. Over a century, the two great empires of Russia and Russia developed a thin ice exploration, espionage, military and diplomatic game in Central Asia, called the Great Game.

0	The girl N, the young man who lets me sleep, is the author of the play so much that he can get his brother and sister to go in and write it. It's so naive, it's confusing, it's a star. I don't know why he's writing a book like this.

1	"The author should have defined it as a psychological science-comprehensive book whose content is well understood, in which films appear more exemplify, with a sense of contemplation, and in ""Ghosts of Tsim""."
0	You really don't have to write about it. It's not like Nile, though.
0	I'm not disappointed when I'm cleaning up the bookstore. It's a waste of time to read this book. The author can't make it up in the back. If it's not sealed, it's not sold.
1	And the second half gets more and more comfortable reading, and the example is still good.
1	It doesn't look like it's the first time I've read it.
1	It is common to describe the complexity of human beings in terms such as “coercive dichotomy,” but it is clear that there is also an incontrovertible depth. There is an extremely natural combination between the chatter that Olson Wells talks at the table about topics that carry his own timidness, and the film text that is dedicated to the audience.
1	Seeing the end, watching the movie with such tolerance, is that where it's supposed to be?
1	Every line of dialogue is repeated in the brain, and the language is too elegant.

1	Can't take it, can't let go...
0	It's probably a bad version of the choice, and it's not fun to read. Look at some of the chapters, look back for an overview of the book, look at the main ideas. It's kind of hot, maybe it's not my type.
1	As a memoir of those who escaped from the Nazi concentration camps, no words of hatred were found in the entire book. After reading it, the author became more admired. Calm, rational, optimistic. The characters drawn out in the memoirs, no matter how many ink, are alive.
