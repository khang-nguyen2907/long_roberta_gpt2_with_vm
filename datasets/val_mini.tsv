ear ringing and fatigue. i started amoxicillin the next day and the sinus pressure went away but the rest of my symptoms remained and i was absolutely miserable. i stayed on the antibiotic for four more days with no improvement - in fact i lost my voice around this time. i went back to the doctor and started levaquin. i was on that for four more days with no improvement and actually started coughing up/blowing my nose and producing this unnatural bright solid yellow mucous. i've seen much mucous in my day i'm a nurse. i've never seen mucous this color. it wasn't a seethrough yellow it was a solid bright yellow and when i blew my nose i could feel it pulling out of my sinuses by my nose. it was miserable and i could hardly breathe. at this point i went to the hospital where they gave me hour long breathing treatments solumedrol iv and put me on omnicef (another antibiotic). after a full week of this antibiotic i finished it. now (two/three weeks later) my mucous is clear/red (from all the irritation) i still have laryngitis (no voice) coughing from the tickle deep in my chest apparently have asthma now new symptoms last 4 days i've had joint pain and am seriously dizzy. i shouldn't be getting worse should i? i mean for crying out loud i quit smoking 4 weeks ago i'm using daily breathing treatments of albuterol ventolin inhaler as needed. i'm so exhausted that i just want to go to sleep and not wake up. what is going on? why am i not better? i've been to the doc 3 times and the er twice. they say there's nothing they can do for me but i'm concerned that something more serious is wrong. i'm scheduling an appointment for the ent doctor but around here physicians are really. lets just say i want an opinion from this online community before i go. please please please give me opinions?	i've been sick for 6 weeks with what the doctors say is a viral infection but i'm getting worse not better. normal? . it started with normal cold like symptoms which was ok. i made it through about two weeks of that just fine and was getting better. i was late picking up my narcolepsy medications (aderrall) and went through about 3 days of withdrawal which i'm sure made my immune system crash. i got my medication back but became seriously ill with what the doctors told me was a sinus infection. i concur. severe sinus pressure hacking wet cough dyspnea . . . to be continued
that would be highly-individualized. there are no set time limits or rules in this issue. some men do not lose their erections after ejaculation but most will encounter a refractory period that can last a few minutes or a few hours. as long as the man doesn't fall asleep after sex and he is still interested in a second round of sexual activity the penis will usually comply. hi its the called refractory period but its a man to man thing and what hour of the day it is and what day of the week it is but add into this how sexy your being to him and if he really wants to go again. hope this helps. good luck	how long after ejaculation does it take to become erect?
most helpful answer not having a fallopian tube can indeed decrease your chances of getting pregnant. assuming your right ovary is still working the lack of a fallopian tube on that side means any egg put out by the ovary has nowhere to go. that means you can only get pregnant when your left ovary is putting out an egg. obviously you can't control which ovary puts out an egg in any given month. your best bet is to consult your gynecologist for specific information about your case. he or she may be able to refer you to an infertility specialist for some kind of treatment. i wish you all the best!	i'm trying to get pregnant from last 3 months. i dont have right felopian tube does it affect to get pregnant? wt do i do?

maybe you could start with smaller bouts of exercise instead of 50 minutes. start walking for 5 minutes per day and as you feel stronger increase to 10 and so on. make sure you eat something about 30 minutes before exercising like a banana yogurt or granola bar. if you are low on glycogen (stores of carbohydrates in muscle) it could increase your tiredness after exercise. if you continue to feel tired without a good reason visit your healthcare provider for a full blood work-up. certain nutrient deficiencies like anemia can also make you tired.	why do i get so tired after exercising? . i haven't gone out and done physical activity for about a month so i just went out for a nice and easy power walk for about 50 minutes. i come home and suddenly i just feel sluggish and exhausted. i don't starve myself. i eat when i'm hungry and when i need to eat. i get super tired and when i come home i just knock out. because i get so tired i don't like to exercise when i have school. it's been affecting my health and my body. i really want to exercise daily. help please <negative_smiley>

dizziness can occur anytime during middle to late pregnancy. here's why it happens: the hormone progesterone dilates blood vessels so blood tends to pool in the legs. more blood is also going to your growing uterus. this can cause a drop in blood pressure especially when changing positions -- and that can make you dizzy. if your blood sugar levels get too low you may feel faint. recommendations: move around often when standing for long periods of time. lie on your left side to rest. this helps circulation throughout your body. avoid sudden movements. move slowly when standing from a sitting position. eat regular small meals throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar.	how can i manage dizziness or feeling faint during pregnancy?
i wouldn't recommend taking taking anything without your ob's ok. but that early the baby should be fine. i was on drugs when i found out that i was pregnant with my oldest son. that day i quit everything and i have been sober ever since. but i did many drugs in the weeks before i found out i was pregnant. he is about to turn five now. he is perfectly normal and healthy and extremely smart. so your baby should be just fine! but from this point on talk to you ob before you take any prescription or over the counter medicine. i hope this helps and good luck to you and your baby!	hi i'm 2 weeks pregnant i took half a 10mg temazepan tablet twice in the past 2 weeks before i knew. is this v harmful
age spots are sun spots (brown spots) that come from sun damage. many people don't realize that sun damage comes out years after the sun exposure. so they don't bother to wear sunscreen on a regular basis. it's important to wear a broad spectrum sunscreen everyday as sun damage is cumulative and 10 minutes everyday adds up.	what are age spots?
if you have hypothyroidism your doctor will prescribe a synthetic (man-made) thyroid hormone t4. you take this pill every day. certain other medications can interfere with how your body absorbs synthetic thyroid hormone. make sure you doctor knows about all the medicines herbs and supplements you take including over-the-counter products. you will need regular blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. your doctor may need to adjust your medication dose from time to time.	how is hypothyroidism treated?
first off you want to check for signs of dehydration including fewer wet diapers less play sunken eyes sunken fontanelle (soft spot on baby's head) loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. the fact that your baby isn't eating enough for adequate growth is another consideration. six months is also the time to start solids which is important for development and nutrition. this webmd article discusses various causes of diarrhea in babies. i would contact your doctor to find out if he or she wants you to come back in or get referred to a gastroenterologist. i think your gut is saying something isn't right -- and that is very important in my book. there may be a chance that your baby is intolerant to lactose. i would take her to the doctor and demand action. for the moment you could feed your baby cooled boiled water to ensure that she is receiving enough fluid the body can cope better without food than it can without fluid. i hope you find this useful and i hope your baby feels better soon.	my 6mth old weighs only 12. 8 lbs and has had diarrhea for 3 weeks what tests could be done to help determine the cause. after the first week i took her to the doctor and they diagnosed her with ear infections. she started augmentin a week later i took her back because she was still having diarrhea and loss of apetite and fevers ranging from 99. 0 - 102. 7 rectally. her wbc was 9. 5 and they said it was probably a virus. now another week has passed and she isn't better. no fevers that i have noticed but she is having watery bowel movements about 6 times a day and is only eating about 16 oz of formula a day.
technically yes. if sperm from the cowper's gland i see no logical reason why sperm wouldn't also survive traveling on fingers. sperm are not fragile. they are extremely tough. the journey they take to reach the egg is like running a marathon but with toxins traps & fluids rushing at you. they can also live up to 5 days after ejaculation. you can watch the journey that sperm take on youtube. it's incredible. the risk of pregnancy is very low and the semen needs to still be very moist too be alive but yes you can get pregnant.	"anyone here who knows of a pregnancy due to ejaculant on fingers being rubbed on vagina during mutual masturbation? . i've read many many replies (on many websites) from doctors regarding the chances of getting pregnant by a small amount of ejaculant on one's hands being rubbed on the vaginal opening. some say ""yes possible b/c it only takes one sperm"" while some say ""very unlikely b/c sperm need to be inserted higher"". i'd like to know: 1) is there any medical professional here who actually knows of a pregnancy happening from such a situation? 2) are there any more scientific studies on this? thanks"
one can help to prevent atherosclerosis and reduce heart attack risks by: controlling high blood pressure and diabetes. never smoking or stopping cigarette smoking. exercising regularly. losing excess weight. lowering blood levels of ldl cholesterol. increasing blood levels of hdl cholesterol. lowering blood levels of lipoprotein a cholesterol and triglycerides. increasing ldl cholesterol particle sizes. taking antiplatelet medications (such as low dose aspirin) to prevent blood clots. consuming antioxidants to prevent blood vessel damage (however not scientifically proven to date). consuming folic acid and other b vitamins to decrease blood levels of homocysteine (however not scientifically proven to date). many of the measures that prevent coronary atherosclerosis also benefit other arteries such as carotid arteries and cerebral arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain). therefore these measures also prevent strokes.	how can coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks be prevented?

home pregnancy tests are very accurate so it's unlikely that you were pregnant before especially if you were at least 7 to 10 days late for your period. chapped lips aren't a common pregnancy symptom but it sounds like you had this issue before. given the recurring problem with your period and the other symptoms you're having i would not assume this is pregnancy. it's worth a visit to your doctor to find out what's going on. there's no harm in taking another pregnancy test but if it's negative call your doctor so you can find out what's going on.	my period had been late 3 months in a row. i have been constipated and i nearly fainted. could i be pregnant? . my lips have also become very chapped and they did in my first pregnancy too. i have taken a couple pregnancy test the first 2 months my period was late and they were negative but i havent taken on in over a month.

plaques from atherosclerosis can: stay within the artery wall. there the plaque grows then stops. they don't block blood flow so may never cause symptoms. grow in a slow controlled way into the path of blood flow. eventually they cause significant blockages. pain on exertion (in the chest or legs) is the usual symptom. in the worst case they can suddenly rupture allowing blood to clot inside an artery. in the brain this causes a stroke; in the heart a heart attack. the plaques cause three kinds of cardiovascular disease: coronary artery disease: stable plaques in the heart's arteries cause angina (chest pain on exertion). sudden plaque rupture and clotting causes heart muscle to die. this is a heart attack or myocardial infarction. cerebrovascular disease: ruptured plaques in the brain's arteries causes strokes with potential for permanent brain damage. temporary artery blockages can also cause transient ischemic attacks (tias) warning signs of stroke; however there is no brain injury. peripheral artery disease: narrowing in the arteries of the legs caused by plaque. that causes poor circulation pain on walking and poor wound healing. severe disease may lead to amputations.	how does atherosclerosis damage the cardiovascular system?
these bacteria are spread through direct contact with mucus from the nose or throat of persons who are infected or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. ill persons such as those who have strep throat or skin infections are most likely to spread the infection. persons who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. treating an infected person with an antibiotic for 24 hours or longer generally eliminates their ability to spread the bacteria. however it is important to complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. it is not likely that household items like plates cups or toys spread these bacteria.	how are group a streptococcal bacteria spread?

look for shampoos and cleansers that contain salicylic acid. you can also look for washes with benzoyl peroxide. if that does not help control the issue it’s time to see your dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment. they may prescribe an antibiotic by mouth along with a prescription-strength shampoo to help clear the breakout faster and minimize the risk of scarring.	i am a 36-year-old male. i have acne on the back of my head and is sometimes very painful. any idea what this can be? . it seems to come and go randomly but has been occurring for about three years now. i have tried different shampoos and our laundry detergent has not changed.

it depends on the form of vitamin b12 you are taking. gastrointestinal side effects associated with parenteral cyanocobalamin or vitamin b12 given by injection have included dyspepsia nausea vomiting and mild transient diarrhea. these side effects are very mild or not present at all with oral vitamin b12. if you are experiencing severe gas pains that have not subsided within a few hours you should consult your health-care provider.	can a b12 supplement taken with an antidepressant cause severe gas pains?
blood pressure is the force in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. you have high blood pressure when that force is too much. high blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood throughout the body and causes damage to the blood vessels. if high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to stroke heart attack heart failure kidney failure and vision problems.	what is high blood pressure (hypertension)?

no you can safely sleep with commercial earplugs. homemade ones perhaps not. earplugs made with a wad of cotton can become trapped in the ear but those inexpensive foam ones designed to block ambient noise are fine to use. have a good night's sleep. as long as the ear plugs are well fitted to your ears you should be fine. you obviously don't want them to be able to get inside the ear canal where they could be difficult to remove.	is it dangerous to sleep with ear plugs in?

routinely the root canal treatment has three steps in total. pulp extirpation. root canal preparation. root canal filling. since you have mentioned that pulp removal was done under emergency there are more chances of remnants of pulp along with bugs to be left behind in the roots inside. in your first visit most of the pulp and pus should have been removed and that is why you got no pain until now. the maximum time usually allowed to start up root canal preparation is four weeks but it does not mean that you will lose the tooth waiting long. however it is best when the treatment is finished in short time frame unless it is medicated in the case of severe infections. there are high chances of root canal treatment attempted tooth when left untreated to get broken down because of no strength and no proper protection such as a cap. hence i advise you to get your next appointment as soon as possible and go ahead with the treatment plan. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I recently had an extirpation of pulp as an emergency on one of my teeth.

the infection is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). after hiv is in the body it attacks and destroys cd4+ cells which are the part of the body's immune system that fights infection and disease. when hiv weakens or destroys the immune cells it may lead to certain illnesses or diseases such as some types of pneumonia or cancer that are more likely to develop in someone who has a weakened immune system. these conditions are a sign that hiv has progressed to aids. hiv is spread when blood semen or vaginal fluids from an infected person enter another person's body usually through sexual contact from sharing needles when injecting drugs or from mother to baby during birth. hiv is rarely spread by blood transfusions or organ transplants in the united states because of improved screening procedures. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection?

methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa is an increasingly common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections. mrsa has become a common bacterium causing skin infections in people that seek medical attention. most skin and soft tissue infections begin with redness irritation warmth and swelling of the infected area. because community-acquired mrsa is a virulent (aggressive) bacterium the infection may develop quickly and create a painful red swollen bump on the skin. this may be called a furuncle a boil or an abscess. itching is not one of the main features of mrsa infection. most skin itching is due to dermatitis -- skin that’s inflamed by non-infectious causes. allergies dry skin eczema or chemical irritation are some of the most common causes of skin itching due to dermatitis. dermatitis tends to be mild and come and go while often a true mrsa skin infection tends to get steadily worse without treatment. that’s not to say that an mrsa infection can never itch. for example skin that’s already irritated and itchy (as from a dermatitis) is more vulnerable to infection by mrsa or another bacterium. an mrsa skin infection by itself might be itchy at first but it would be expected to become tender or painful as the infection progressed.	does mrsa itch?

"as a diabetic you are considered to be immunocompromised -- more prone to infections and more prone to infections becoming serious. pseumomonas is among the most common organisms that cause otitis externa so this is not uncommon. having painful ""cold sores"" (herpes) in the ear is more rare but does happen. think of it as having shingles in the ear. the disease is called ramsay-hunt syndrome assuming you were properly diagnosed. the treatment of a bacterial infection is with antibiotics but a viral infection like herpes requires antiviral medications. if you have not seen an ear specialist or dermatologist this may be something to consider since having a definitive diagnosis is essential if you are to be properly treated."	how does a person get cold sores in their ear? how serious is this? can i use over the counter creams? . i am diabetic. 42 yrs old. smoker. dont drink or do drugs. had a bacterial ear infection from nov 2013 to march 2014. pseudomonosa argeonosa (sp? ). gp thought possibly coldsores in my ear too. finally only scab was left in my ear but it never went away. the scab was thick and white. 2 weeks ago i started getting blisters in my ear again but the fluid is clear somerimes a bit yellow but not green like when i had the bacterial infection. any help or info would be appreciated. thank you.
two things. once you have shingles (herpes zoster) you will always have it. the body's immune system will usually suppress it and keep in from breaking out but it will still be there. you will always have the potential for a recurrent outbreak but about half of the people will never see it again. shingles in not treated with antibiotics. it is a virus and viruses are immune to all antibiotics.	already had shingles can i get them again? . i was 19 yrs old when i first got shingles and became very sick from the antibiotics i was given for them. i am 37 now and because i was so young when i first got them i now wonder if i will get them again or is it like the chicken pox where once you get them you dont have to worry?
