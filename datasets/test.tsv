0	Sex, dark side, no love. Of course, some of the terrible passions do exist in the human body, sometimes or someday, and I don't like it. I'm not curious about anything anymore, like I was a kid. I've got my own point of view, and that's something that I don't like.
0	Seeing a third of my friends in Angli, I take my advice back when I see it. Because it's an endless extension of the End of Childhood, and the author is a talker, it's enough to add lace, probably late for male cancer. Now science fiction is really bad. Arthur Clark would be happy to talk to him about how to write space alien field research.
1	Peaches, I've read this one.
1	This is what I call “the pain of being aware of too much.” The desire for a pure life is mixed with the inescapable and insatiable confluences. This is the new “surplus” and the prelude to some of the late ministers.
0	You can see it when you're in love with a girl. You borrowed the name of Ligang. It's a shame it's such a beautiful book.
0	It's for the kids who just read the novel.
0	The author of the collection played a great role in writing and family history.
1	It's simple. It's a master's style.
0	I threw up.
0	Don't be superstitious!
0	It is said that beautiful women are a curse, and the term “red-haired-water” is used for one woman to play a tragedy. When one sees a beautiful woman, it's always the same thing, the good is not the good thing, the bad thing is the good thing, the bad thing is the bad thing is the good thing, and in the legend, if beauty and intelligence exist together, the woman will be seen as a fox and become a leprechaun in the mouth of euphemism.
1	Mythology travels through modern times, and this one's a little big!
1	On the third summer, the North Teacher's bookstore went up every evening for a while, and it was over for half a month.
1	Slightly nuanced, life's harshness seems to have become tender from the bottom of his pen.
1	The translations are excellent, smooth, uncomplicated, and the novels taste great, as if they were pure as they were when they were read in the Humming Hills. They also write medievals, religions, and churches that are different from Eko’s pens, but are as strong as they are.
1	I haven't seen a book in a long time. There's so much to surprise.
1	Military life and entrepreneurship and human life
1	It's so exciting to see so many powerful people, even if they have nothing to do with themselves.
0	Goes to the doctor, so it's later than Ishikang.
0	Three points. Zero pens, no logic, no bullshit, super Mary Sue, no bit funny, and a little miraculous.
0	The reason why you can't see is because the country is too strong and it's too strong to be a village.
1	The image of Henry James is as true as the sketches, and his family is included in a small book, and I don't see enough as a reader. As a master Colm Tobin, a wise pen is attractive.
1	It's amazing!
0	Three.
1	It is apt to say: “The panorama is a long story of the history of social, economic and life change in China over the past 30 years of reform and opening up.” It's called the 30-year novel.
1	There's no spirit of freedom, no idea of independence, no science.
0	Write whatever you want.
1	Good book! Five stars recommend it. I didn't realize that Chief Djaco's heart was so nuanced, that his desire for freedom and his insistence on his dreams, and that there was a saying that my little friends and I were shocked at being out of the mainstream, that he was so determined and insistent, that he washed my brain.
1	They're both too attached to each other in their groaning.
1	Level of entry
0	It's over soon. It's not much.
0	The old-fashioned scene, I'm speechless. It doesn't matter.
1	It's interesting to have some chapters on land rights.
0	It's nothing special, it's a story of hatred, misunderstanding and sudden love.
0	It is good to write about the incomprehensible abyss of ancient Gods and the masters of ancient days. It has to be extraterrestrial. It turns out to be a pseudo-scientific fiction.
1	The most knowledge-intensive book in Lui!
1	I really like Uncle Ke, who's full of cheesy characters.
0	If you don't have a HC object, you can think about it.
1	I love it. I'm going to read the English version again.
1	The favorite novel of graduate school. Like a gorgeous maze! The color of the heterogeneity!
0	It's very literary.
0	The farmers are always indignant and disgusting about that.
0	20% drops. Prenuptial rhythms do not fall into the usual pattern. After marriage, it's as long as a rag. The most intolerable is that the male and female masters are as incompetent as they are, smart as they are, and the rest of them are at a low level of intelligence. How can the male master stand up again for seven or eight years?
0	I was bored and unthinking, so I forced myself to watch it for half a day, and I finally couldn't watch it anymore.
0	It's a bad translation. It's recommended the original.
0	One of the slowest books to read, and one of the hardest to understand. I don't know if I'm limited or not, and I don't see enough points. It's like the author digs a lot of holes, and then he doesn't fill it out at all. I admit that the text is beautiful, but in the narrative, I don't see it at all.
1	It's like talking about Han Woo-dee, but also about the schizophrenic mentality. It's more inspired in methodological terms than in results. The reading of saline iron is so wonderful that many things are broken. But reading a series of controversial articles, it's still a bit far-fetched.
0	To tell you the truth, the history of ancient thought is too hard. It's not appropriate to read it to people who have no basis in the history of thought, so they won't be poisoned by Mr. Kim. The next volume is supposed to correspond to China's recent history. This is a good part of Mr. Kim's insight. He's too ambitious.
0	It's fucking boring. It's like snow.
1	More is known about the film industry and film creation.
1	Maybe, after a few trillion calculations, you can finally answer how to find love.
1	I'm afraid that's not enough.
1	"""I'm looking for a quiet place to die, and it's suggested to Brooklyn that everyone thinks he's dead."""
0	"That's what the first paragraph says, but it's starting to get out of hand soon. There's basically no analysis. It's okay to look at the fun. The last few dozen pages are just the slogan ""Kyoto rises forever."""
1	Big hand pen.
1	As long as you like Eño.
0	Tian Lei!
1	The book I wanted to read in '09, it's only now. The bitterest, bloody, lonely, cruelest and warmest dark fairy tales.
1	I'm tired of reading this book.
1	Is it the book or the weather?
1	You have to experience its different state at different times when you like it.
1	♪ Today in the water ♪ ♪ I can't tell you ♪ ♪ I can't tell ♪ ♪ I can't tell ♪ ♪ I can't tell ♪ ♪ I can't tell ♪ ♪ I can't tell ♪ ♪ I can't tell ♪
0	To be honest, it's not a good book.
0	It's an economic theory. It's a fantasy.
1	3.7h.
0	Because it's thin, stretching into a book, and it's just a simple story of a girl who didn't believe in love falling in love with a lot of lovers.
0	There's a reputation for XIVro!
1	It's more of a homogenous use: a pilgrimage. It's a very close one if you want to know about the building. But it's not a book anyway. There's a lot of books to think about, but whether it's a guidebook in Chinese or English, it's usually a big road. Even though the history of English is a bit better than it is in Chinese.
0	Two stars are given because of disappointment, not bad in itself. It's not my geography novel, it's just a critical collection. Some of China's contemporary writings are similar to the melody. It's not travel.
1	"In the book entitled ""Little as a Walk"", there is something that I think films are like a song and try not to speak directly and sad and lonely as much as possible, but to express them in a side-by-side way. With proper white retention, the story is complete by the imagination of the audience. The purpose of my creation is not to express myself, but to communicate. It is not ""I"" that gives birth, but that the work is already in the world. ""I"" simply picks them up and shows it to the audience."
0	It's flat.
1	In '78, reform started again, in '94, and in '03 I joined the World Trade Organization. Reading this book gave me a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of globalization and urbanization, and a lot of angles and knowledge points that I had not thought of before. As the preamble says, the direction that affects the world must be a universal economic law, especially when it comes to taking a long time.
0	Not really.
1	If you've been sitting at the bottom of the well, you'll never know the vastness of the sky. As the profitability of domestic banks declines, it depends on how successful the major commercial banks are in their transformation, and how hard they can learn to dream about the infinite possibilities of exploration in this vast world.
1	All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
0	There is hardly a book that makes me so sick of reading at the beginning, not because of the contradiction of ideas, but because the author greatly underestimates the intelligence of the reader, uses the reader's brain as a test field for her poor products, and reveres the spirit of ducks. How can there be anything like this in the world that can be called a great philosophy?
1	The wild dreams of a group of people who have broken the old system, but who have been moved // /a wave of winners, can only say that time can prove / /or judge with a modern perspective is too vain to be put in the current circumstances, and that every success was a hero//so how violent was the health-care market in the 1990s? / Engels was right that the original build-up was full of blood.
1	Artist!
1	I want to eat it when I look at it.
1	Do some homework for the movie...
0	Normal, dog blood.
0	Doesn't anybody think it's too thundery?
0	I can't watch this translation anymore.
1	It's too late to see what Chiu's plans have been going on for so long, so he's ready to take a look at it tonight.
0	As you know, you don't understand.
0	"Some say it's a foreign version of ""the three of us,"" and I just want to say it's impossible to compare it to better!"
1	Yoko recommended it.
0	Looking at the beginning, there's no desire to see at all.
0	It's ugly.
0	I don't think it's funny.
1	Those of us who are so vital in our lives will always stand by us and live with us at the most ordinary moment.
0	It's good to touch your head. It's just the story of the little pea that makes me feel okay. It's a lot of walking, and there's not much of a heart, and you'll sometimes be grateful for someone's help, but you won't be able to do it any more. It's because you're looking forward to what you want, the power of imagination.
1	At last, it was very shocking that the destruction of virtues contrasted strongly with the inevitable decline of the world, and had a very strong sense of reflection in the present world. Covic was a great writer, writing where you could write Christian beauty and the horrors of the abuse of faith by the Crusade Knights.
0	The beginning is still good, the more sleepy it looks, the more straightforward it ends. The lady's a fake. The whole story, the same thing, the boring lady's saying, is all over again, and the most important thing is that she's not cute.
0	Have you read this book for the five stars?
1	Shenzhen Library, February 2009
0	I don't see what you're talking about.
1	Five stars!
0	There's a lot of tears in the commentary. Maybe I'm numb...
1	A better understanding of the decision-making process, a realistic understanding of the gold standard, inflation, and, more importantly, an honest, committed, strategic and original decision-maker — Paul.
0	P
0	Two-star-and-a-half Coptic readings.
0	So many people think it's nice, but what makes me think it's a waste of time?
1	Mr. Chanmou's history is solid, and I think as much as I can. It's rare.
1	The word of the family.
0	I can't stand this startling Marysull's pathology.
0	Look at the second floor of the central building.
1	Step one.
0	In general, it's more interesting, that's all. Confucius is the first person to propose sexism.
1	Efficient organization, efficient system.
0	Such a colorful book can be made hot in China, and it has been branded with a very bright title that responds to the cultural level and reading quality of the population today.
1	It's practical.
1	It's harder to give up a dream than to stick to it.
1	Non-institutional growth
1	Write whatever you want!
0	Words are lively, don't think they are correct, as Xiao Song is, language pleasures and a vast store of knowledge. The discussion of globalization 1.0 is a bit of a lie about why China has not developed so much that it is locked up because of concerns about the consequences of technological development. It is deeply shocked by the three self-confident prides of the authors. The analysis of the Japanese nation is also sensational. Chapter XII is still familiar.
0	The woman's boss, the man's disgusting, the man who's taken possessions from someone else's house is really getting worse.
0	It's a lot worse than usual, but it's less impressive to try to follow the world's new language, not to mention to secretly guide the reader's emotions as usual, though it's a lot to repeat.
0	I can't read it.
1	Each article is short and concise, expressing ideas in clean and modest words, just like his film. He simply says, but triggers thoughts and feelings. Like the first chapter, it's touching. He's a human being who knows how to catch, see the details, wonder the heart. It's amazing to make up his film and do his homework.
0	It's a joint book.
1	This is the beginning of Dostoyevsky, and it is the beginning of a new literary era, in which the irrational impulse of human beings is presented with justice. It's just a little rough.
0	It may be an important journey for the author personally, because walking 800 kilometres and dozens of days requires more than physical strength and more perseverance; but, unfortunately, perhaps for translation, it is impossible for readers to learn from and feel more.
0	It's too much.
0	P
0	More than Gone.
1	It's just an astrologer.
1	A living life is here, no matter how dark it may be, the most moving is the light in life, without giving up love and faith, without giving up faith and hope, without giving up the energy of life because it comes from inside, with love, with light, with faith, with love and respect for the right to love and to believe. Is it a living moment? Is it heaven or hell? Is it really freedom? If I have to, then I can give up on you, but I will never give up on you, because I know what is in my heart, and it is my right and the meaning of life, because I believe in love, so I know where the light of my life is. I choose never to give up my love for you, because I never to give up my love for myself; because I choose never to give up, because I know where the stars are, no matter what day or night. If there is pain, then let it come again, haha.
1	Core values of competitive advantage
0	Don't like the originals. Translation's not bad.
0	It's normal, or I don't get it.
0	Male and female masters are annoying.
0	I've had a ride, but I haven't had a trip, and the ocean has resonance, and I still want to say it's a bad picture, Mr. Cheung...
1	Tragedy.
1	Desire is more attractive than the object of desire, and the meaning of the object is nothing more than an unknowing human being, and ultimately a subconscious, but we tend to turn our backs on the subject, ignoring the true source of fear. Ps: Translation is a little obscure.
1	A semi-biographical memoir is so moving.
1	Personalized writing is the most personal, in the words of the contestants: it's a very personal thing. A hundred years of film, too much talk, too much film history, so personalized fun is a very interesting addition to the writing of film history.
0	Well, it's called a novel. Where'd you read it?
1	The mystery of the golden fairy vision and the mystery of the psalm remain undisclosed. What about the fourth? What about the fourth?
0	He's still interested in the beginning, but he's not feeling it anymore. He's just saying it's normal.
0	Why can't the golden bottle be called the world's famous? And it's far from the golden bottle, and the name of the emperor is among the world's most famous?
1	The focus of novels on male and female masters gives the work an abnormal sense of truth, as it is always written in Japanese literature, and it is a remarkable work — but indeed yellow enough — that men, women, families, sexuality and death are treated in quite a way.
0	Finally gave up reading.
0	It's the story of a man who's got a crush on her, and the fact that she's a junior and a boss. Think that everyone's Anastasia. Please learn to bite your lips unwittingly.
0	It's normal.
0	Who are you?
0	Hypnotizing the Book of God.
0	When I was in high school, I didn't remember anything until now, except that I was sick of it.
0	I've decided to block this man.
1	It's a little too long, too long, so long, it's confusing.
0	One must have a long-term vision of the world, and I am afraid there are few who can do it.
0	The score is not low, junior high school students have to read it. The drawback is poor. I want to see the colour page. Now I have little interest in some macro-events, so that I can waste limited brain cells in endless details? In 1700, Asia accounted for 62 per cent of global GDP and Western European countries together for 22 per cent; and in 1913, before the First World War, Western European countries accounted for 33 per cent of global GDP, the United States for 20 per cent, Asia for 22 per cent. Then English became a global language.
0	Garbage raiding whores.
0	It's really not a good tone for me. Seventeen percent drops on the ending. It's a lot of it, too much for kids in science. It's a lot of it.
0	There's no such thing as a terrorist suspense or reasoning.
0	N.
1	The big black cat is too good for the mirror!
1	It'll be better with more.
0	It's bullshit. I don't want to go on.
0	P
1	It's full of English humor. It's so filmy.
1	Yes!
0	N.
1	As a biography, with a pen, it's also good to leave the film behind.
0	"""Every man has a bomb in his heart,"
1	It's more political science, and of course you can see it, and it's a pleasure to see scholars and translations like this.
0	The literature of the land...
0	Can there be a future in writing masters in popular novels?
0	A copy of the dog.
0	Dog blood! Waste of my time!
1	The big game, which is aimed at India, is based on Napoleon's vision, implemented by Shao, and its geographical spread to the Caucasus and the Black Sea, East Dhakashgart and Lassa, and spanning nearly a century, has brought forth a number of outstanding heroes and more silent victims. The two empires fought and opened up, and completed the final conquest of the Columbus era for business, for security, and for honour.
0	A little less than a star and a half.
1	Cheaper chewing, paper fragrance. Good book, Gausss. Likes it.
0	"In fact, it's not as simple as ""The Speed of Walking"" or ""The Speed of Walking."" There are also problems with the quality of translation (surreal, the Bridge Endurance that the translator used to flip is OK!), especially after nearly two-thirds of the time, does it get rougher over the dead end? In short, reading may only raise a little bit of awareness about the branch; but I guess his writing is good, and he's a loser."
0	P
0	It's too fake. Half a barrel of water starts loading.
0	It would be good to share with others the process of realizing their own ideals, but it would probably be better to leave some more practical information to help people who share similar ideals with themselves.
0	Emotional authors, emotional books, epiphany of Ike's overexploitation... are like the spread of Renaissance history.
0	Well, hard to see... you say you're so ugly, but you're a little more dry, you're a little more superficial in every way, so what do you want me to do?
1	Empirical talk.
0	Time out.
0	It's just a form.
1	It's kind of a pain in the ass for the movie.
0	It's obviously the best.
0	Some of the disappointments were that it would have been a graphic book with only text, but that was not the key. The whole book was simply a Q&A, it was not systematic, and it was not much that would have helped the reader to gain insight into Lynch's film.
0	"I read this book for the young ""The sky is the bank of the Red River."""
1	I can't forget Antonioni.
0	Oracle can cope with its brand, and the Carpenter and recent books written by Japanese are boring.
0	Three.
1	Early in the morning, when you see the flash of dew, warm happiness is when you rewrite it. The story is so gentle, and life is so lonely. Japan’s contemporary novels are the best in grey life stories to emphasize happiness and love as if they were a collective, unconscious search, with a fragile and clean set of values behind them.
0	I don't feel anything, I don't feel anything, I don't feel anything, I don't feel it? I feel like I'm going. I've wasted hours reading this book.
1	It reflects the cruel stories of society with warmth. Give praise to the kind ones. Give praise to the orphans who do not give up their lives to fate. Shouldn't we value our lives more after seeing them?
0	I can't even read a big book.
0	Why would Kindle push this book?
1	Yearly reading of TOP10.
0	When you look at the beginning, it's not as good a story as you write. Why are the scores so high?
0	The language, text, content, and circumstances are so different, the content is poorly structured and incoherent, that even the description of the tall master's clothes is as poor as that of a magazine. The only bright spot is that the names of the characters are hard to read.
1	It's a classic, it's clear, it's well-argued. What's lacking in the United States is that the brushes are too aggressive.
0	It's the first book to be reborn, and it's not going to make you feel any better, but it's not much to look at as the emotional part of a love novel, and it's too low for the IQ of the person she's doing the right thing, and it doesn't make any sense to fight.
0	The blood of a dog, Mary Sue.
1	The best of three books.
0	It is not so lonely, and the feelings for the dead wife go through the entire book, and it does not show isolation, but it is rather unsettling.
0	I can't read any more. Yuhua's narrative is. Shit.
1	It is not as easy as reading in the dam study in Shansihan, drinking Kabtino, roasting fire, beautiful lazyness. It is not easy for Israel to build a State, it is not easy for the Palestinian Arabs, no one can resolve the tragedy of history, and it will be difficult to solve it.
0	White Man, it's a bit of a mess.
0	It's over. It's a story written for the sake of the plot, it's too big, it's too big for the author, it doesn't matter how much it's written, it's not done yet.
1	He's a translator. He's a translator. He's a translator. He's a translator.
0	The story is so simple that it's disgusting. But I have to say it's one of those novels that can't be understood even if it's been interrupted for a long time.
0	It's too long, it's full of frames, and the protagonist's halo is too big.
0	Oh, my God.
1	Here comes Bismarck to Hitler, where the whole Prussia transformation is carried out with clarity. The deepest words are: few countries can go to their own destruction as brightly as Prussia. Hafner's pens are beautiful.
0	This part of Zhang's self-absorbed book is so lame that it hides the light of other chapters. I think I'm not a bright young man in my heart, but I see the heart of the prostitute as interpreted in the book and feel: it's so self-defeating that it's so boring to fall into so much boredom.
0	http://ishare.iask.sina.com.cn/f/5550977.html
1	It's very concise. It's very informative.
0	23-year-old me comment: That's a lot of bullshit.
1	History is often defined as a trade-off mirror, not all of which are reliable. But the edifice built by history, which combines many scientific fields, such as human beings, the universe, geography, history, biology, culture, etc., is indeed a source of wisdom, of looking at the past in a higher place and of visiting the past.
0	It's normal.
0	It's simple. It's simple. It's not read in detail.
0	Why is it so high when you wear Mary Sue?
0	I don't like the big story of killing and killing.
1	That's the second time I've seen it.
0	Spain just won the crown. It's a good book. I'm a little tedious with author style.
0	It's not smooth, it's tripping, it's not emotional. It's set well, hey, chicken ribs.
0	Stupid yellow book roll.
1	It is not true that the review of the fractures in the morning has widened. In the afternoon, the women's platoons have defeated Brazil, and they are invincible. At the very first point of the score, they can't handle it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it, they can't do it.
1	As friends, love, and frenzy fade away with the fissure of society. The little hand in the flood is an awkward, unadapted existence in reality, although rough, but exceptionally dynamic. Looking at Jasminko can find a sense of fate that may reflect a society as a whole. But as an improvising inspiration, the chief of the department is very solid.
0	I've read a few chapters, I haven't. I don't like books like that.
1	Wolves gave a book. A common idol.
0	Why don't I like it so much?
1	I really don't like this cover design. What is it?
1	I can't feel it.
1	"The moon of the middle devil! Satan paved the way for the resurrection of Adam and Eve. This maniac, Burgakov, is fascinated. A serious joke is the destruction of the forces of evil, the storm, the night, the dawn, the rainbow. ""Whosoever loves, he shall share his destiny with what he loves."""
0	Honestly, I can't watch.
0	History reviews, which emphasize logic without logic, say that analysis is not analysis and that the racks are disconcerting.
1	It's very good. It's very popular. It's very attractive.
0	Can't bring me a book of new wisdom, it's too urgent for Mr. Zhang to write it.
0	It's a waste of time.
1	For the rest of your life, please.
1	There's no doubt it's enlightening for audio-visual language.
0	A creator's life, coming and going, but talking about the same story.
0	It was written by the author during his daydream. The examination was boring. It was merely a reflection of the author's dysentery.
1	The combination of the director of the bull fork and the writer of the bull fork is the greatest blessing for the audience and the reader.
0	Unfaithful.
0	Looked at the beginning. Didn't read it. Give it up.
0	I don't know what to say.
1	While the narrative is repetitive and a little tedious, it is true that what is said is justified and that what is in keeping with economic norms is sustainable.
0	It's written in prison, it's rare, but it's all over the place. Three stars, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
1	The stories are good, the writings are good, the scenes are tight, the stories are not slow, or the stories are not full, and the people are great. The most important thing is that in so many gold fingers or novels that take them up and down lightly.
1	A millennium culture, cut off from five to four.
1	At last, I've returned home, and I've seen the spring of this man, the spring of the river, the brooks of flowers, the mountains of De, and I don't know if my newly married wife is still in the mood... whose daughter is born, full of spring light, beautiful? Do you know what your faults are?
0	I've seen so many people read this book, and it's cold in my heart, and this copy of the conspiracy theory is bullshit, and it's a little bit more than economics to realize what the problem is (as amateur players like me can see), and it's a deliberate attempt to distort history and facts, and to force God to be in the service of a popular view. One is ignorance, two is fear, but fear cannot be used as a shield. And I realized through those lawyers that the recent shootings were not brain-brained, but heart-black.
1	It's basically impossible for a literary student like me to read it, but it's good to look at it directly. After reading this book, it's good to have new ideas and ideas about some of the problems in society.
1	An example of the power of economic academic writings in the late 1980s to study new directions in history.
1	There will be tears. But I think the Chinese government is no better at respecting history than Japan, so you are not in a position to blame.
1	It's a chaotic world.
1	A better Wang Jia Wei movie criticises

0	The sharper view of a detailed and in-depth medical record and analysis of Billy, rather than this Rory novel text, has greatly diluted the authenticity and impact of the Billy case.
1	At that time, the psychoanalyst appeared to be a very basic part of what was written in the first half of the book, anxiety, subconscious, dreamy, and enticing... and then the subconscious became integrated into itself and became attached to Novalis... and there should be some sects in the book, such as the different understandings of the secret, but I don't have any knowledge about it.
0	It's kind of interesting to have a few. The guy who wrote the appendix compares a dead chicken to a Vonnecutt.
1	It's amazing. It's a good idea to read it.
1	One of the few times I've been made to date by sighing to cover my snots.
0	Just looking at the content, I'll think it's written by Li Seung-peng. If it's a big eye, I play four stars. But because it's a big one, I play four stars. The rest of the book was well-received, concise and humorous. Now it's written a bunch of social hotspots, the government bug, thinking that it's a hollow image. It's a long story that can be said to be seven short pieces that are not only empty, but that the text is not simple, and that use a lot of glorification, without any restraint in their expression.
1	A professional book.
0	It's not good writing, it's high school practice.
1	The knowledge density is so high that it's worth reading.
0	I don't remember what to say. I should've given it up.
0	Looks like it's all right.
1	It's a few years old, and it's all over in the morning. It's like a cover: a guide to the first steps!
1	It's a pretty academic book. It's hard to read.
1	It's a sketchy version, like comics, which doesn't feel good. It's not sure if it's too old for writing and translation. It's suggested that beginners look more at recent derivatives and come back and read classics later.
1	It's worth a look!
1	Nanking! Nanking! Remember history.
0	It's very famous, but it's very common for me to say first I don't like to keep talking about how a woman is modern, then she's a forensic doctor, how a big surgeon can't get caught up in it, and then the killer's full of emotional psychosis, a bit of motivation, a lot of local loopholes, of course, but it's not worth praising how easy it is to have triplets in ancient times, how unrealistic it is, how unrealistic it is.
0	It says that chicken soup does not count as chicken soup, that there is no systematic structure, that the language is scattered, that there are times of suddenness, that there is no realistic book, and that some of the photographic works are well-constructed.
1	Super, awesome, yeah!

0	It's ugly, it's boring, it's boring, it's full of crap, it's worse than a love show, it's hard to see two thirds of the time you've spent on this book.
1	Some classic movie reviews. They didn't have to be bought.
1	9.0
0	It's quiet, it's dumb, it's written by the owner and the helper, it's decided to buy it home, it's a test with a gift. With regard to the content of the article, I just want to say that it's really not the right color to write about this mess.
0	I don't want to curse the translation of this book! But after the translator has read your translated book, I really have no idea but to swear at you. What can I say to you when such a good book has been translated into such indecency? Ms. Hanf may indeed have a Chinese lady by the name of Kim! But that's not so much what an American writer will have in it!
0	Look at the grass. It's boring.
1	Shoo, it's just a film review.
1	Super-clash five stars. I can't even read a TV show. Why do I always think I know a lot, and there's an external voice in my novels, and there's a psychological description of it. I'm a fool.
1	It's new. It's worth it.
1	I want to read the original.
0	It's always been thought that the term is used specifically to describe the Middle East region. The unique culture, the vagaries of history, and the incomprehensive publicity of the media have cast a veil over the region, which is a source of mysterious charm and appeal. Unfortunately, the book's contents are confusing, uninterested, and without in-depth thinking.
0	I found a little book in junior high.

0	How did Don Qi write this Mary Sue?
0	I'll go. How can this be so good?
1	It took two days off work to finish this book. It's really nice, recommend it.
1	In detail, there is some chatter and repetition. It's easy to understand, it's too hairy, and it's the most top-level knowledge and skill. The most valuable is the tremors of the two scripts that describe their creative experiences.
1	The central question surrounding the book is why China’s feudal society has lasted for more than 2,000 years in its cyclical collapse and renaissance. The author has given the hypothesis of a superstabilization system that is worth reference as a historical perspective. This superstitious situation stems from the integration of the political structure with the ideological structure, which in turn is a combination of the economic structure of the landlord economy, the political structure of highly centralized bureaucratic politics, and the ideological structure of Confucian culture.
0	Do you have to write that long when you're done with a few words?
1	He wrote Cold Blood, and I didn't read it; I didn't read Tiffany's Breakfast. But I was glad to read it first, but I didn't regret that I had read Capote, no matter how disappointed I was to read the first two books later, because there was a thin little book. We could have done something wrong, but there was only one sin that could not be forgiven, which was deliberate cruelty. No matter how many fictions the author added, I'd rather read it, because I didn't want to use the technicality of novels to analyse it, and I thought that it was a short, but not all-out, winter's warmth.
1	That's the price.
1	Love is compromise. 20141024
1	It's all the amputated warriors that rocked me.
1	It's more appropriate as a photo tour, and there's not a lot of really useful stuff to learn. The almighty daylight balance is going to be tried next time.
1	It's a great script. It's filled with incompetence and incompetence, but it's very warm.
0	All I can say is that it's written, for a star.
0	It's definitely stolen. I can't believe there's no such thing as love.
1	Just looking at Enemy Falls and reading it out. Faraki's first book, a story of 50 years ago, is still alive.
1	A slave or a human? Cora has never been a weak man, but a human instinct, allowing her to finally decide on the path to a future where it is most likely to be dead. The rails go forward, to the future, only to move forward, and to be free.
0	It's a novel that turns the words upside down and reassembles.
1	It's very practical. There's a chance to go second-hand.
1	Even if the world really abandons our generation, we really should sit still. We need to reflect on what needs to be countered. We need to use independent thinking to analyse what is going on in this world, rather than the dream of the spring and fall when the world rises itself. No one can really tell us where it is.
0	Boring
0	A few hundred pages of the history of the world, even a brief one, is bound to be meaningless. Religion, culture, military, and science are not clear at all. People who do not study history can use it as an entry book in the clouds, with a little bit of a foundation and a little sense of value.

0	I tried, but I couldn't read it.
1	It's a good financial introduction. It'd be better if we could get a few more real-life statements, one by one.
0	The following brief remarks are a good feeling.
1	"It's actually called ""How to write a movie review paper."" The last two chapters are put into paper-searching and formatting standards. Of course, writing a professional, skill-based paper is a hard job, with little chance of writing it in life, but it feels good to think of it as ""How to read a professional film review."""
1	It's amazing. It's been three days. It's always reminiscent.
0	It stinks and it stinks.
1	It's not as bad as the translation.
0	It's just a nice sentence.

1	It's also an early novel. It's very interesting to think about marriage.
0	Studying what modernity is, basically, about selling history.

0	Mom's first book is so mean, the author's taste is so heavy, it's just the next piece of jb.
0	It's really y-y-y-y.
1	Family, it's worth thinking about.
0	I don't know what to ask for for a bookshop. Is it an introduction to a Taiwanese cultural worker?
0	It's been a month and a half, and you can't say it's not painful. And there's a big story: Logic is basically based on comparison and attribution.
1	That's great.
0	It's lame.
1	A perspective worth learning by correcting some of my inherent prejudices.
0	One star is dunkin
0	It's rubbish, there's no meaning to the text, just like a novel reading 1984. In some ways, literary books tend to see their validity primarily as a result of their irrational study of human beings and their fear of complexity. People need to know that people are most complex, that the world is complex and that there is little certainty.
0	It's called a book? Words don't understand. There's no basic argument for saying things in the form of stories.
0	It's always like looking at water across the ice, dark and calm, and it's all over. Her character has no feelings and no temper, and the conflict is like a fist on cotton. I can understand if a new writer is a writer. He's been writing for so many years, he can't get his head clean, he's not responsible, he's not the author, he's not the editor, he's not the editor, he's not the editor, he's not the editor, he's not the editor, he's not the editor, he's not the editor, he's not the editor, he's not the editor.
1	High school's favorite. He took it to college. He gave it to me.
1	It's very practical for writing and editing. It's not very suitable for non-type films.
1	It's a good book. The Taiwanese translation looks tired.
0	Waste of time, waste of money.
0	What's the first 100 pages of the book? Countless extraneous characters, stories, gossip. What's the last 50 pages of the book saying? All memories, feelings, until now, are more objective than academic papers. Fifty pages in the middle of the book are the same. Eight lives in exchange for the author's swollen narrative.
1	A book that hurts the heroine.
0	The only good word in this book is to hold the crab daisies mid-autumn.
1	History of thought.
0	But the reasoning in this book is far too far-fetched. I can only understand that it is the wisdom of the elderly: tell you the truth, what do I do?
1	A book read many years ago, which looks at Hong Kong movies from a foreign perspective, is interesting.
0	It's really hard to read, it's a lot of things in a hurry, it's about the famous people, it's about how well they're connected to the family, it's about the people they've actually touched, but it's just about what's on the face.
1	The theory is similar to most imported principles, and the most important hook concept is a deformation of the premise of the story. Eppstein and McKee, compared to others, have a lot of problems in the body, and many of them are points, lack of cross-cutting spirit and strength. But he has an amazing sense of lightness, which makes him attractive. If McKee is in a professional class, he's a celebrity, perhaps because business patterns are better analysed. In short, it is still a supplement and an expectation for me to read 9.23.

1	The second half is amazing. I'm going to read it a second time.
0	I'm sorry, I don't know.
0	Ms. Liu's order is a mess. Reading is for the sake of reason, reading a bad book written by a bad person cannot be understood, putting responsibility beyond reason on the book, and telling Ms. Liu's brain once again is a moustache. And some things are written on the column.
0	It's a travel book. It's just a book about investment. You can't leave your own business in your travels.
1	If, according to Bresson's standards, more than 90% of the films are out of order today.

0	It's a better ending. It's a better end.
1	There's still a connection between reading and seeing a movie.
0	It used to feel good on the side.
0	The content of the book has nothing to do with economics: ask questions of a general nature and answer them with general answers. If you want to read books of economics, read them honestly. Such books can only give you the feeling of reading, but the content is empty, and it's a good time-consuming thing to read at the airport.

0	I've been waiting for Mark Levy, but I've been growing grass because of my title, and I've been working on it when I need a cure. It's over. It's over. It's over.
1	It's a great book. Life in the town is a lot different. It's always been biased towards the South China Sea publishing house, and it's too commercial. For the first time, the book shows the truth.
0	It's very important not to give stars.
0	WTF?
0	It's a girl's thing.
0	I always remember Wen Hui getting dirty.
1	Very detailed.
1	There is a systematic description of the life of Changping today’s village, especially when the director’s part is basically written on a work schedule, and there is a greater understanding of the director who loves to film the “meatbird life.” From his reading of The Angel of Kurosawa, he was determined to be a film director, to the teacher’s unconvincing of the way in which he filmed him, to his own film company, which was founded after the Red Killer, to film a series of deep-seated works, and even two golden palms, more recently known as the director’s establishment of Japan’s first film school, which he has spent his whole life running around economically without any relaxation of his own work.
0	Hardly believed it was written on the night of Kikuchi. At first, she was interested in her travels, finding out that it was actually 15 months, where she lived and where she ate, and who she met. Words were amateur, almost the same level that anyone went out to play on blogs. She just walked long enough and went a lot of places. So she gave up.
1	It's not boring. We'll see.
0	It's forgotten. It's a mess.
1	Otsu’s essay is consistent with the style of the film, is simple and simple, preserves the originals of daily life, and discovers beauty unwittingly. The image of the letter is strong, like a mirror script. If the red flower in the field, the rash wheat fields outside the autumn city, and the white almonds flying in the battlefield are not seen during the invasion of China, it would be better. The translation is bright, and it is highly suspicious that the translator is of Chinese classical literature.
1	It's written for fools like us.
0	More common novels, typical Xiaochun works as the leading female, and then is surrounded by a bunch of boys, entangled in conversation, enthusiasts of princesses, and young girls like the dream of princesses, even though they can see it when they see it and forget it completely.
1	It's a thin one. It's a lot better for historical figures in the three countries. I didn't think it would be that bad.
1	It is only the first chapters that have made it clear how Szema-Gwang, in his management strategy, has been able to change his history by taking personal goods and changing his political agenda. After that, the author of Szema-Gang’s unreliable refence Han-wu story is motivated to write these two paragraphs.
1	I don't hesitate to give it to the five stars. That's a great way to write it.
1	A guide to modern Qin Shanlian life.
