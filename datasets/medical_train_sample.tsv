i definitely would not stop taking the fosamax without first talking to your doctor. you don't want to risk having more problems with kidney stones. the side effects you list are not commonly associated with fosamax. of course everyone is different and it's possible that they're associated with the medicine but it could also be something else. there are also other medications similiar to fosamax that the doctor may want to try if it seems like the side effects are due to the medicine.	can i stop taking flomax once i have passed the kidney stone? . i am a generally healthy 52 year old female. last week i was diagnosed with a 5mm kidney stone and was prescribed flomax to help pass the stone. i passed it about three days later and now i am wondering if i can stop taking flomax. the urologist said i would have to take it for a month then have a follow up ultrasound to make sure i don't have hydronephrosis. i find the side effects i'm experiencing (headaches stuffy nose and nose bleed) very annoying.

"you are most likely causing retrograde ejaculation. in other words the semen is going into your urinary bladder instead of out of your penis. i do not recommend that you do this because it can create problems at a later time when you are trying to conceive. there is no harm with masturbating but do not do this ""squeeze"" technique any more."	weird mastrubating problem. i have been doing this for the last 4 years! . this may sound a bit weird but i have a bad habit of holding my sperms inside by squeezing my penis hard enough so that it doesn't come out. this first happened by mistake but later it seems i don't like cleaning up my ejaculation so i just do this again and again. i don't think this is safe or healthy. would you elaborate what kind of problems this can cause? also what happens to the sperm that doesn't come out? and if any damage has been caused till date how can i know & possibly cure it.

most vaccines is a small dose of the live virus. the way it works is it allows your body to build it's own antibodies so you may get symptoms when given the vaccine to fight off the virus now & in the future usually it will allow you to fight the illness while keeping you from getting the symptoms.	is it normal for the shingles vaccine to produce shingles-like symptoms? . my father received the shingles vaccine and less than 48 hours later is experiencing skin sensitivity below his belly button in a space of skin about six inches across. he says the friction of his clothes against the area bothers him when walking and it also hurts to bend forward. these issues seem to be reminiscent of shingles symptoms to me - is it possible that the vaccine could be the cause?

"well it certainly sounds like you're doing all the right things to avoid high blood pressure. i salute you! and i want to add: keep doing all those things. our blood pressure tends to fluctuate a little during the day. this is normal. so if you're taking your bp at home and discovering these fluctuations you may not have hypertension at all. granted 140/90 is considered the ""hypertension threshold "" but it's usually concerning only if your pressure is sustained at that level or higher all the time. if for example your blood pressure measures 140/90 immediately after you've been exercising that would be considered a pretty normal finding. everyone's blood pressure rises during exercise -- that's part of the point of exercising to get your heart pumping. to your question however many conditions can cause hypertension. kidney problems definitely rank high on the list. adrenal gland tumors also can be the culprit. but i caution you not to jump to any conclusions. the truth is even seemingly healthy people like yourself can develop high blood pressure and we don't know exactly why. this is called ""essential hypertension. "" although it's more common in people with a family history of high blood pressure anyone can wind up with it. if you're concerned about your blood pressure your best bet is to see your medical provider. he or she is in the best position to assess your condition and determine if you have hypertension or not and if so whether or not it needs to be treated. meanwhile keep up the great work! you're an inspiration to the rest of us."	what other medical conditions cause high blood pressure? . i am 66 years old female and do not take any medications. i am not overweight. i workout 1 hour 3 days a week. i do not have a family history of high blood presure. i do not smoke or drink. i eat healthy meals and do not overuse salt. i am not under stress. up until this year my bp was 100/60 now it ranges from 100/60 to 140/90. what other medical conditions can cause bp problems?
in very small quantities bacon isn't bad for your diet. but it might increase your risk of heart disease stroke and cancer. first 68% of bacon's calories come from fat almost half of which is saturated. each ounce of bacon contributes 30 milligrams of cholesterol. bacon is also a processed meat which is not considered safe to eat according to the american institute for cancer research. (processed meat is usually red meat preserved via smoking curing or salting that contains nitrates a carcinogen. ) regular consumption of processed meats may lead to higher risk for prostate cancer and several other cancers. if you have to eat bacon one ounce should be enough. even with the highest-fat type of bacon one ounce adds up to 140 calories (the same as one cup of low-fat milk or two small slices of whole wheat bread). choose a slightly leaner type such as oscar mayer center cut smokehouse thick sliced and one ounce adds up to 105 calories and 7. 5 grams of fat. don't make bacon a daily indulgence. when you do treat yourself keep the serving size small and include antioxidant-rich fruits or vegetables in the meal whenever possible.	can bacon be part of a healthy diet?

you may be suffering from a combination of acne and seborrheic dermatitis (sd). typically sd sufferers will have flaky skin around the nose and hairline in combination with dry patches. there is usually an underlying fungal component (with sd) that can be treated with an antifungal cream and/or shampoo. flare-ups can be controlled with over-the-counter corticosteroids. once this component is under control your acne will be easier to treat. your acne prevention regimen should include an antimicrobial facial wash that contains benzoyl peroxide acid or alpha-hydroxy acid a mild exfoliating agent and salicylic acid to help clear your clogged pores.	i'm 48 years old and i have adult acne. also the skin around my nose flakes. what can i do about these two issues?

"" foods considered high in purine content include all types of alcoholic beverages; some fish seafood and shellfish such as anchovies sardines herring mussels codfish scallops trout and haddock; and certain meats such as bacon turkey veal venison and organ meats like liver. foods considered moderate in purine content include meats such as beef chicken duck pork and crab lobster oysters and shrimp; and vegetables and beans such as asparagus kidney beans lentils lima beans mushrooms and spinach."	what foods do you know of that can trigger gout attacks?

creating strong sleep habits — for you and for your child — is not just an important goal it’s an achievable one. there are several simple practical steps you can take to help your entire family get the nightly good rest they need. keep in mind these basic new-parent strategies for protecting your sleep and your relationship. share the workload: rotating feedings at night trading off chores — when both partners are involved in family work everyone gets a break. know yourselves: pay attention to your own natural inclinations when it comes to sleep. the night-owl of the two of you is probably better suited for the midnight feeding than the early bird. one-on-one time: it can be tempting to put every moment of attention to your baby especially new moms. nurturing your marriage is important too. find time every day to connect with your spouse. to help your child develop strong sleep skills start early with these basic habits: slow things down: as bedtime approaches quiet the activity level in the house. television music and high-octane running around can be replaced with reading and quiet play as you prepare for your child’s bedtime ritual. bath bed repeat: create a bedtime routine that you can follow nightly. maybe it’s bath then pjs followed by a book and a back rub. your child’s routine should be quiet soothing and enjoyable for you both. set that bedtime: once you’ve picked a bedtime for your child stick with it. toddlers ages 1-3 should be sleeping from 12-14 hours a night. (the national sleep foundation has recommendations for sleep amounts for children from infancy to adolescence. ) whatever time you pick remember — consistency is the key. don’t skip the naps: skimping on naps won’t make babies more apt to sleep. also it’s best to put your child when she’s sleepy not exhausted or actually asleep. this way she’s better able to develop self-soothing techniques that will help her fall asleep on her own.	what can i do to help my baby sleep better at night and keep my marriage strong?

"then go to alanon for help. i am not sure how much help a ""walk-in"" clinic will provide to you. they certainly cannot provide the ongoing care and support that you may need to stop your drug use. doctor do not call the police when someone discloses illegal drug use. they cannot force you into rehab but this could be something they may suggest based on your usage and state of health. conversations between dr and patient are confidential and protected. telling your doctor that you may have a substance abuse problem and asking for help will most likely result in the suggestion and encouragement to enter rehab; however your doctor cannot force you to go. although in most cases cocaine abuse does not require detox most individuals who use cocaine also have other substance abuse including alcohol prescription painkillers and illicit drugs. in this case medical detox treatment can help them remove all the toxic chemicals related to their substance abuse from their body. after substance abuse detox treatment most people benefit from going through a rehab program or participating in behavioral therapy. substance abuse is more than a surface activity and usually stems from some deeper issue. a rehab program or counseling service will be able to help the individual get to the bottom of their cocaine use and help them resolve the issues. groups such as 12- step groups and other non-traditional non-12 step programs offer support within the community. these programs offer suggestions and explanations on how to avoid relapse. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929."	if i go to a dr and tell them i need to quit cocaine cold turkey will they call cops or force me into rehab or something. i just realized i let coke take over and went hard in the paint over the last 3 days. i need to quit no tapering just be done. but i know it will hurt in many different ways. if i go to a walk-in clinic or a dr will they call the cops or force me into rehab or something like that becausei cannot have either of those happen.

surgery is not used to treat mild or moderate symptoms of lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus or sle). surgery may be considered for people with lupus who have permanent life-threatening kidney damage. a kidney transplant or kidney dialysis may be done instead of continuing long-term treatment with high doses of medications that have serious side effects. if kidney disease from lupus does not respond to high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications kidney dialysis or transplant are reasonable options. for unknown reasons overall lupus disease activity is often less severe during dialysis and after kidney transplant. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for lupus systemic lupus erythematosus?

"drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. this document does not contain all possible drug interactions. keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. do not start stop or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. some products that may interact with this drug include: cidofovir corticosteroids (such as prednisone) high blood pressure drugs (including ace inhibitors such as captopril lisinopril and angiotensin ii receptor blockers such as losartan valsartan). this medication may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other drugs that also may cause bleeding. examples include anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel ""blood thinners"" such as dabigatran/enoxaparin/warfarin among others. check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin nsaids such as celecoxib ketorolac or naproxen). these drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. however if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually at dosages of 81-325 milligrams a day) you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/stroke. talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. if you must take ibuprofen talk to your doctor about possibly taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric-coated/ec) while taking ibuprofen. take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or at least 30 minutes after your aspirin dose. do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval."	does ibuprofen m interact with any other medications?

well there's honestly no way to tell without having a physical examination. however common sense would say a more likely cause of abdominal pain would be constipation not pancreatitis. constipation is much more common. chances are if you had pancreatitis you would know it. you probably would go to the emergency room since acute pancreatitis not only is very painful but usually causes nausea vomiting and a fever. if you have upper abdominal pain that doesn't go away and is accompanied by other symptoms (like fever and vomiting) your best bet is not to try to self-diagnose. go to an urgent care for a diagnosis. wishing you well!	is it constipation or pancreatitis

"if you're new to exercise or have struggled with it in the past talk with your doctor about your exercise plans. after that start by incorporating more activity into your daily life. for instance: if you always take the elevator try the stairs. if you try to park next to the door of wherever you're going park farther away and walk. if your habit is to eat at your desk take a 10- to 20-minute walk first then have your lunch (or take a walk after you eat). instead of watching tv all day saturday and sunday plan active weekends. go to the park take a walking tour ride your bike or row a boat. whichever plan you decide on it's a good idea to set weekly goals: write down what activity you plan to do on what day of the week for how long and at what time of day. be as specific and realistic as possible. for instance write down ""tuesday: walk for 20 minutes at 7 p. m. to the park and back. "" at the end of each week review your goals and set new ones for the upcoming week. research shows that setting goals will help you stick to your program. it will clarify what you're supposed to do and let you track your progress. if you hit a roadblock later on you can refer back to what has worked in the past or use your accomplishments to re-energize yourself. first make sure that your doctor clears you for exercise before beginning. he or she may ask you to fill out the physical activity readiness questionnaire (par-q) to ensure that there is no reason for you not to exercise. i would then recommend setting personal goals using the s. m. a. r. t. acronym which stands for: s – specific m – measureable a – attainable r – realistic t – time-oriented here’s a sample goal keeping these principles in mind: “between january 1st and february 1st walk three days per week for twenty minutes per session to aid in weight loss. ” set up short term goals to help you meet your long term goals (6 months or more). think about what you want to achieve by beginning an exercise routine. do you want to lose weight lower your blood pressure or help manage diabetes? do you want to run a race such as a 5k? what do you hope to gain from starting exercise? the biggest problem that people have is that they overwhelm themselves by doing too much exercise too soon. it can be hard to sustain a drastic change like that long term. instead slowly and gradually progress with exercise to make for an easier transition and to allow your body to comfortably adjust. start out doing low impact exercise like walking or riding a bike then gradually increase the time intensity level or number of days per week that you exercise. if you’re new to strength training get help from a personal trainer to make sure that you are using the equipment properly. make a plan and stick to it."	where do i start if i have never exercised?

probiotics are live microorganisms that preliminary research suggests might have a useful effect on your health. your body’s digestive system already contains hundreds of different types of bacteria beneficial and necessary for the digestion process. probiotics are specific bacteria that are thought to help regulate the digestive system by managing certain gastrointestinal conditions like diarrhea constipation or inflammatory bowel disease. not all yogurts contain probiotics however. to ensure that the specific brand of yogurt that you’re looking to purchase contains probiotics make sure that the label says that it contains “live active cultures”. you can also read the ingredient list to determine which bacteria specifically since different types of bacteria are thought to promote different health benefits. for example the probiotic bacterium specifically promoted by dannon activia yogurt is bifidus regularis which among other claims is suggested to help alleviate constipation to keep you regular. it’s important to keep in mind that in order to continually see any of these suggested health benefits that you would need to regularly consume these products. yogurt with or without probiotics can provide many great health benefits. check out this webmd article for more information: <link>.

the answer to this question depends a little bit on the source of the nicotine. for instance nicotine patches and gums contain a specific dose of nicotine that is designed to clear from the body after a short period of time. nicotine absorbed by the body through smoking chewing and other tobacco use can linger for a longer period of time. each person's unique metabolism also plays a role in how quickly the body gets rid of nicotine. in terms of testing nicotine may be detectable up to 30 days after a person last used it. some types of nicotine tests are more sensitive than others. for example a blood test is generally considered more sensitive than a urine test which means a person who passes a urine nicotine test might not pass a blood test. other types of nicotine tests include saliva and hair testing. in terms of smoking cessation nicotine withdrawal symptoms usually peak between 12 and 24 hours after the last cigarette. as the nicotine slowly leaves your system these symptoms will decrease. if you have concerns about nicotine withdrawal or smoking cessation talk to your healthcare provider. nicotine can be very addictive depending on the dosage and lengths intakes. that being said visit <link> and listen to what the expects are saying. safe	how long does nicotine stay in the body?

baby : your baby is still just a glimmer in your eye. although it's confusing to think about a pregnancy starting before your child is even conceived doctors calculate your due date from the beginning of your last cycle since it's hard to know exactly when conception occurred. mom-to-be : at the beginning of a cycle about 20 eggs called ova begin to ripen and occupy fluid-filled sacs called follicles. one of these follicles matures and ruptures releasing an egg that will travel down the fallopian tube where it awaits fertilization. this all takes place about 14 days before the end of your cycle. this is the time you're most fertile so light some candles take the phone off the hook and set aside some intimate time. an egg can be fertilized for only about 12 to 24 hours once the ovum is released. don't be disappointed if it doesn't work the first time. you have only about a 20% chance of getting pregnant each month. tip for the week : make sure you've scheduled a preconception visit with your ob-gyn to determine risks of genetic diseases environmental hazards and lifestyle changes necessary to ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby. most important make sure you've started taking 0. 4 milligrams or 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. folic acid taken a few months before conception has been shown to dramatically reduce the likelihood of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.	what can i expect during weeks 1 and 2 of my pregnancy?

hi found you this do you think its this? one particular virus (called coxsackie) seen most often during the summer and fall may cause the child to have a somewhat higher fever more difficulty swallowing and a sicker overall feeling. if your child has a coxsackie infection she also may have one or more blisters in her throat and on her hands and feet (often called hand foot and mouth disease). infectious mononucleosis can produce a sore throat often with marked tonsillitis; however most young children who are infected with the mononucleosis virus have few or no symptoms. what do you think? same or not? good luck	my daughter has very painful blisters in her throat without fever or swollen glands. what could be the cause?

truly speaking mthfr - methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase mutations are widely spread and all most one half of the population is having or carrying these mutations by different extent. by different extent i mean to say various levels of affection or involvement that is from very insignificant disease to severe disease. i do want to know that in which category you are now. this is fairly judged by the serum levels of homocysteine which is the protein that is increased in the blood. if you have a severe mthfr defect then you need to avoid folic acid and also need to screen some fetal congenital defects like spina bifida or anencephaly at an earliest. but if you do not have any specific symptoms with this mutation then there is no harm to take these vitamins. pai mutations (plasminogen activator inhibitor) could result in abnormalities in blood clotting disorders. this actually poses no bar for taking folic acid in pregnancy state. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am 5 weeks pregnant and I have MTHFR and PAI mutations.

bipolar i defines patients with the classic form of this disease: recurring episodes of mania and depression. bipolar ii defines those who never experience severe mania but instead the manic episodes are milder and alternate with depression. a third term rapid cycling bipolar disorder defines those patients who experience four or more bipolar episodes within 12 months. this can include multiple episodes within one week or even within one day. this more often occurs later in the disease and is more common among women.

if you're training for an endurance event like a marathon when you might run 60 miles or more per week you'll almost always see a decrease in your muscle mass. for most of us who do more moderate amounts of physical activity there will be minimal if any loss in muscle mass from aerobic exercise -- so there's nothing to worry about. if you do plan on lots of aerobic exercise and are concerned about losing muscle try starting with 20-30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (at 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate) two to three days per week and see how it goes.	does aerobic exercise interfere with muscle gains from weightlifting?

early ejaculation is probably one of the most common sexual problems in men. depending on how you define this condition some studies have found that up to 30% of men suffer from premature ejaculation at some point in their lives. the exact cause of premature ejaculation is not known and treatments focus on the behavioral psychological and medical aspects. here's a lineup of some of the treatments that are available: antidepressants- some can cause a delay in ejaculation. these medications include paxil or zoloft lidocaine creams and other desensitizing creams prolong the time to ejaculation. desensitizing lubricants are available over the counter. the squeeze method developed by masters and johnsons or the stop and start technique are also employed to help with premature ejaculation and help prolong sexual activity. if premature ejaculation causes you anxiety its important to meet with a mental health counselor. seek medical help for early ejaculation since these treatments may help you but part of the treatment plan should be to have a sustained and satisfying sex life. what is ejaculation? ejaculation is the release of semen from the penis following sexual climax. when a man is sexually stimulated the brain sends signals to the genital area through nerves in the spinal cord to contract the pelvic muscles. at the start of this process waves of muscle contractions transport the sperm with a small amount of fluid from the testes through to the vas deferens. the seminal vesicles and prostate contribute extra fluid to protect the sperm. this mixture of fluid and sperm travels along the urethra to the tip of the penis where it is released (ejaculated) at the time of sexual climax (orgasm). doctormens. com you need to put your focus into your woman instead of constantly thinking and worrying about your penis. muscle programs are often activated by our thoughts so if you worry and imagine yourself ejaculating you will lose control and ejaculate. keep in mind that your conscious mind can only focus on one subject at a time. hi! i am 33 years old. i tried duramale after i suffered from premature ejaculation for many months. i saw the money refund policy so i decided to buy 3 bottles on <link> since there were no risks. i was very happy about the results even after 6 weeks but i followed the treatment very strict. this was my secret i guess. i recommend duramale to everyone who suffer from early orgasm. duramale pills can be purchased only online from website through credit card debit card or paypal. for complete details and best price of duramale visit <link> hi! i am 31 years old. premature ejaculation is more common than you think. up to 40% of all males experience this in their life-time. i personally overcame my issues with premature ejaculation by following these very helpful tips. if interested please click here: <link> i hope it helps you as well as it did for me.	is there any cure for premature ejaculation? i am 28 male and ejaculate within 2 mins. i am not at all satisfied.

i'm as confused as you are. i don't see how any health care provider can say a disease process doesn't exist if they haven't done the appropriate testing. however if your internal medicine doctor has done any blood work on you recently i would assume he or she did in fact test you for b12 deficiency since you'd been previously diagnosed. i think the key here is communication. i'd suggest you make another appointment with your internal medicine provider to discuss your concerns and confusion over the situation. if your provider has blood test results he or she should be happy to share them with you. if not you may ask again to be tested since you're symptomatic. if you don't get satisfaction from this provider feel free to find another one. it's important to have a primary care provider who listens to your concerns and takes time to explain the answers to your questions. all the best to you!	why would one doctor a neurologist says i have prenicious anemia associated with b-12 deficiency and another says no. i was getting monthly injections and now my internal medicine doctor says that i do not have it. i can't get him to test my blood for it again. 7 years ago i had drank alcohol before the blood test and i told the neurologist this and he said that it would not make the b-12 level drop as low as it was. i am tired all the time dizzy numbness and tingling in my hands and my feet i bruse if you touch me my symptoms are worse than they were 7 years ago.

i'm glad to hear you're following up on this and have had a nuclear stress test. it's great news that no heart trouble seems to have turned up on that. so why has your resting blood pressure gone up? well there are a number of possibilities. (note i'm not suggesting any of these may apply to you. i'm just talking about various reasons a person's blood pressure can rise in general. ) for one thing as we age our blood pressure generally starts creeping up. by the time a person reaches age 80 for example it's not uncommon for him or her to have a normal resting blood pressure of 140/90 or even higher. this usually is caused by a natural stiffening of the arteries as we age. that stiffness raises the pressure inside the arteries which results in an elevated blood pressure. another possible cause for elevated resting blood pressure is anxiety. panic attacks can make blood pressure go up and even a high level of general anxiety can increase the resting pulse rate and blood pressure. pain can cause an elevated pulse rate and increased blood pressure. people in chronic pain often exhibit this combination of symptoms. those are by no means the only things that could cause this particular combination of symptoms. i only wanted to highlight some of the obvious ones. i hope your healthcare provider is able to pinpoint the source of your elevated pressure and treat it. wishing you well!	is a blood pressure of 153/94 dangerous when i have always had a very normal blood pressure before? . i have had normal blood pressure for years but now i have excessively rapid resting pulse and bp in the 150/95 area. i have had a nuclear stress test that showed normal parameters.

in almost every case of sepsis patients need to be hospitalized treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics and given therapy to support any organ dysfunction. sepsis can quickly cause organ damage and death. therapy should not be delayed as statistics suggest as high as a 7% mortality increase per hour if antibiotics are delayed in severe sepsis. most cases of sepsis are treated in an intensive care unit of the hospital. appropriate antibiotics to treat sepsis are combinations of two or three antibiotics given at the same time; most combinations usually include vancomycin to treat many mrsa infections. however once the infecting organism is isolated labs can determine which antibiotics are most effective against the organisms and those antibiotics should be used to treat the patient. in addition to antibiotics two other major therapeutic interventions organ-system support and surgery may be needed. first if an organ system needs support the intensive care unit can often provide it (for example intubation to support lung function or dialysis to support kidney function). secondly surgery may be needed to drain or remove the source of infection. amputation of extremities has been done to save some patients' lives.	how is sepsis (blood poisoning) treated?

"adolescence is a volatile time: both socially and biologically. a lot of profound changes are taking place. it's especially important that once a child hits puberty he or she go back to the doctor for a check-up. it's possible that the physical changes of puberty may mean that your teen's medication needs to be adjusted. a lot of parents find that their teenager wants to stop taking medication. some teens with epilepsy feel like they no longer need epilepsy drugs or they don't want to be controlled by a drug. it's important that you make clear to your teen the risk of stopping medication. teens may need to be reminded what it was like when they had regular seizures. also if they haven't had a seizure in some time point out that the reason may be that their drugs are working. teenage years are often a time when standing out is the last thing a child wants. a lot of kids feel painfully awkward and it can be worse for teenagers with epilepsy. they may be embarrassed by their condition. they may be terrified of having a seizure in public. they may also not like the side effects of their medication which may affect their concentration or their physical appearance. it's important to get any of these concerns checked out with a doctor. it's possible that a change in medicine could ease some of their concerns. depression is a bigger problem among teenagers with epilepsy than previously thought says william r. turk md chief of the neurology division at the nemours children's clinic in jacksonville florida. if you think your child might be depressed it's important to get help. for parents some of the emotional preparation for the teenage years can start early. any parent of a child with epilepsy should work hard to establish a ""climate of trust "" turk says. if you have an open and honest relationship with your child when she's young you may feel more comfortable with her independence as she grows older. on the other hand if you're always isolating your kids or imposing restrictions on them they may be more likely to rebel when they get older."	how will adolescence affect my teenager who has epilepsy?

"as you may know gout occurs when uric acid crystals form in the joints resulting in acute and/or chronic inflammation. like heart disease type 2 diabetes high blood pressure and abnormal cholesterol levels gout and high uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) are among the many manifistations of the ""metabolic syndrome"". following a healthy eating strategy and ambitious exercise program as one would do to treat or prevent any weight-related medical problem is a good strategy for gout prevention. the standard medication to prevent gout attacks is allopurinol which is a ""xanthine oxidase inhibitor"" which inhibits the main enzyme that converts dietary purines into uric acid. reduced uric acid levels result in reduced frequency of gout attacks. cherries accomplish something similar in a less potent fashion. the trouble with cherry juice is that meaningful doses come with a troubling amount of sugar. in my view cherry concetrate without the sugar hardly seems worth the bother when one could take allopurinol. in summary i recommend working closely with your doctor to see if a general healthy diet and exercise can reverse your elevated uric acid levels and gout risk. ."	i have been diagnosed with gout and since then my blood sugars are very high. why is this happening? . could it be because i am drinking black cherry concentrate instead of taking the medication that my doctor gave me?

no the term cadaver wart does not refer to an actual wart (a raised lesion on the skin caused by human papillomavirus (hpv) infection). rather cadaver wart is a term that has been used to refer to a raised wartlike growth on the hand due to tuberculosis typically occurring in pathologists or laboratory workers who have been involved with postmortem examinations (autopsies) or processing of surgically removed tissue from a person infected with tuberculosis. a cadaver with unsuspected tuberculosis was once a major hazard for pathologists and others in the autopsy room. since the bacteria that cause tuberculosis do not penetrate intact skin an accidental cut or other trauma to the skin while performing an autopsy on a person who had tuberculosis can lead to direct inoculation of the skin with the infectious agent resulting in the lesion known as cadaver wart. a cadaver wart is known by a number of other names including anatomical tubercle anatomical wart dissection tubercle necrogenic wart postmortem tubercle prosector's tubercle prosector's wart tuberculosis cutis verrucosa and verruca necrogenica.	is cadaver wart a type of wart that actually develops from touching a corpse?

"when blood pressure is not sufficient to deliver enough blood to the organs of the body the organs do not work properly and can be temporarily or permanently damaged. for example if insufficient blood flows to the brain brain cells do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients and a person can feel lightheaded dizzy or even faint. going from a sitting or lying position to a standing position often brings out symptoms of low blood pressure. this occurs because standing causes blood to ""settle"" in the veins of the lower body and this can lower the blood pressure. if the blood pressure is already low standing can make the low pressure worse to the point of causing symptoms. the development of lightheadedness dizziness or fainting upon standing caused by low blood pressure is called orthostatic hypotension. normal individuals are able to compensate rapidly for the low pressure created by standing with the responses discussed previously and do not develop orthostatic hypotension. when there is insufficient blood pressure to deliver blood to the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart's muscle) a person may develop chest pain (a symptom of angina) or even a heart attack. when insufficient blood is delivered to the kidneys the kidneys fail to eliminate wastes from the body for example urea (bun) and creatinine and increases in their levels in the blood occur. shock is a life-threatening condition where persistently low blood pressure causes organs such as kidney(s) liver heart lung and brain to fail rapidly."	what are low blood pressure signs and symptoms?

the common primary symptoms of lactose intolerance are gastrointestinal include: abdominal pain diarrhea flatulence (passing gas) less common symptoms of lactose intolerance include: abdominal bloating abdominal distention nausea unfortunately these symptoms can be caused by several gastrointestinal conditions or diseases so the presence of these symptoms is not very good at predicting whether a person has lactase deficiency or lactose intolerance. symptoms occur because the unabsorbed lactose passes through the small intestine and into the colon. in the colon one type of normal bacterium contains lactase and is able to split the lactose and use the resulting glucose and galactose for its own purposes. unfortunately when they use the glucose and galactose these bacteria also release hydrogen gas. some of the gas is absorbed from the colon and into the body and is then expelled by the lungs in the breath. most of the hydrogen however is used up in the colon by other bacteria. a small proportion of the hydrogen gas is expelled and is responsible for the increased flatulence (passing gas). some people have an additional type of bacterium in their colons that changes the hydrogen gas into methane gas and these people will excrete only methane or both hydrogen and methane gas in their breath and flatus. not all of the lactose that reaches the colon is split and used by colonic bacteria. the unsplit lactose in the colon draws water into the colon (by osmosis). this leads to loose diarrheal stools. the severity of the symptoms of lactose intolerance varies greatly from person to person. one reason for this variability is that people have different amounts of lactose in their diet; the more lactose in the diet the more likely and severe the symptoms. another reason for the variability is that people have differing severities of lactase deficiency that is they may have mild moderate or severe reduction in the amounts of lactase in their intestines. thus small amounts of lactose will cause major symptoms in severely lactase deficient people but only mild or no symptoms in mildly lactase deficient people. finally people may have different responses to the same amount of lactose reaching the colon. whereas some may have mild or no symptoms others may have moderate symptoms. the reason for this is not clear but may relate to differences in their intestinal bacteria.	what are the symptoms of lactose intolerance?

sinusitis and tonsillitis are not technically contagious. exposing someone else will not necessarily give them you exact same disease. it is the germs (bacteria viruses) that can be contagious but exposure to those germs will not necessarily result in the same or any disease since everyone's immune system is different. viruses are the most common pathogens and most respiratory viruses that cause sinusitis or tonsillitis are thought to be transmittable by close contact for a day before you know you are ill and for 2-3 days later. mono is a virus that can cause tonsillitis and mono is contagious for a longer period of time. again exposure does not imply that someone would get anything else by a simple cold. strep can cause both tonsillitis and sinusitis and this bacteria is contagious as long as you are contagious or until the end of your antibiotic course. strep will not just jump out of your throat or nose onto someone else but sharing drinks kissing sneezing in someone's face can certain expose others. if their immune system is susceptible to strep they can certainly get it.	how long are you contagious to other people when you have sinusitis and tonsilitis?

it all depends what prescription meds we are referring to. i would have to ask this patient what else are they on? now tylenol pm and nyquil and those products do contain acetaminophen or tylenol in them. tylenol pm also contains benadryl or diphenhydramine and if they are taken with other products or other prescription meds we could have some side effect issues like increased drowsiness. also we want to make sure that people don't overdose on tylenol or acetaminophen and they may not realize that it may be in some of their prescription products. nyquil we also need to know which nyquil they are on. sometimes there is different versions of nyquil that might have a cough suppressant or a nasal decongestant or it does contain alcohol. so we want to be real careful about the patients that are taking that. we want to make sure too that they are not taking them together. i always encourage patients to come and talk to the pharmacist. labels can be confusing and now when you go down the cough and cold aisle everything sometimes looks the same but we have to read the box and we have to see what the ingredients are and what the dosing is. if you have your medication list on you as a pharmacist i can make sure that there will be no interactions or problems down the road with your other prescription medications other otcs or vitamins and herbal supplements.	are tylenol pm or nyquil safe to take with prescription meds?

yes it can be related. my thyroid was removed in 1973 when i was 21 yrs. old due to benign adenoma. i took armour for 10 yrs. then switched to synthroid for 10 yrs. in 1991 i began having severe hives and red burned face. my family dr. immediately suspected thyroid meds. allergists insisted no way was it that. i suffered for 8 months until my gynecologist took me off synthroid hives immediately began subsiding then on armour and hives returned but looked different. took me off all hormone for 6 weeks and follow up with endocrinologist. said i would feel very tired - but i felt great. all my levels were normal and have remained so for 21 yrs.	i've been taking levothyroxin for over a year. i have developed a rash/hives that comes and goes. is this related?
first i'm not a real fan of any of these over-the-counter or prescription meds. they usually just depress appetite short term and most of the time people develop a resistance to their effects anyway. the suppressants usually have a short life -- over the course of 24-48 hours. however i have no idea what you're taking. there are countless appetite suppressants on the market. i'd need to know precisely what's in the ones you're taking. most have some kind of amphetamine derivative. it is for this reason that i'm concerned that you have other health issues. most of the appetite meds are contraindicated if you have high blood pressure or heart issues. as well many of them adversely interact with a whole host of medications out there. please don't be playing poly-pharmacy on your own. please work with your medical team and tell them what you're taking so that you can all work together for the best outcome. hey i have a radical idea. instead of popping pills join us on this board and on webmd and let's team together to do more physical activity and eat more heathfully so that you can shed those excess fat pounds get healthy and get on with life. you game?	how long does it take for appetite supplements to leave the system? i need to start taking medicine for health reasons.
light moisture and excessive heat can reduce the potency of vitamins and mineral supplements. so the best place to store supplements is in a cool dry location -- in a kitchen pantry or a bedside table for instance. don't refrigerate vitamin and mineral supplements. taking them from refrigeration to room temperature can cause condensation inside the bottle. certain non-vitamin supplements should be refrigerated however. labels usually indicate when a supplement should be kept in the refrigerator. in the case of all supplements it's always a good idea to check the expiration date.	what's the best way to store vitamins and minerals?

unfortunately there is no way to specifically target fat around your abdomen. you may see products or equipment that advertise as being effective to lose belly fat but these are all exploiting a myth called “spot reduction”. just because you exercise your abdominal muscles doesn’t necessarily mean that the surrounding fat from that specific area is being targeted for fat loss. abdominal exercises may help provide a more “toned” appearance through muscle growth but only if you’re at a certain body fat percentage to begin with. doing abdominal exercises may help to strengthen or grow your abdominal muscles but they won’t help you lose fat around that area. the only way to lose weight around your waist is proper diet and exercise in general. unfortunately some people have a specific body type where fat tends to be stored mostly around their waist. your body will ultimately determines where you weight loss comes from. if you would like to still do abdominal exercises check out the ace fitness exercise library for specific exercises located here: <link>	how can i lose wight around my waist? . i'm a female 52 yrs old and lost my thin waist shape from gaining weight there. what exercises can i do to regain my thin waist?
for a temporary change the obvious answer is to use a commercial lip plumper and see how it goes. more and more cosmetics companies are bringing out lip plumpers some already tinted some not. lip plumpers can be surprisingly effective; in a few cases users not only get strikingly fuller lips but the results last up to eight hours as well. to be honest though the effects of most lip plumpers rarely last more than an hour especially if users eat or drink. most lip plumpers use an irritant such as cinnamon wintergreen or ginger that causes enough of a reaction to make the lips swell and look temporarily fuller. some of them especially those with higher concentrations of cinnamon and wintergreen can really make the lips burn sometimes quite painfully. and that burning sensation applies not only to the woman who used a plumper on her lips but to anybody she kisses as well. if your significant other is allergic i’d stay away from these plumpers; obviously people with sensitive skin should also avoid them because they may get a whole lot more than they bargained for. never use lip plumpers on cracked lips or on cold sores because the pain can be excruciating. less irritating plumpers are those with retinol or oligopeptides both of which stimulate collagen production. the advantage to these plumpers is that with repeated use lips will not only look fuller but smoother and less wrinkled. a warning: retinol increases sun sensitivity. i recommend that lip plumpers with retinol be used only at night. for a longer-lasting look you’d have to go with fillers usually hyaluronic acid fillers; my two favorites are prevelle silk and juvederm. in my experience prevelle silk gives a more subtle look while juvederm lasts longer. these lip fillers cost $750- $1000 and last three to four months. some people just want to define their lips so they get a tiny amount of filler injected all around the lip border; their lips stand out more but without added volume. this technique is especially popular with women over forty because the lip border becomes less distinct with age. i would never ever recommend more permanent procedures such as silicone injections or lip implants. with silicone injections problems such as lumps and irregular or asymmetrical lips are actually pretty common and lip implants frequently look artificial. think before you get lip fillers. if you want to see how you would look with fuller lips then try lip plumpers first and see if you like the way you look. when buying a lip plumper or any other beauty product try to read and decipher the ingredients contained in the product in order to see how the plumping or moisturising will occur. also remember that most lip plumpers will eventually result in drying of the lips as most of the plumping ingredients act as an irritant to the lips therefore resulting in the plumping. these products typically work by irritating the thin delicate skin of the lips with ingredients like menthol or camphor. this makes the lips swell slightly which may also diminish the appearance of fine lines in that area. lip filler procedures provide immediate results that should last for up to six months after which time you may need a top-up to maintain the volume. initially there will be some swelling and sometimes bruising in the lip area from the injections. this should quickly subside to reveal your full and plump lips. some of the most common side effects of collagen lip injections are instances where lips swell or bruise after treatment. there can also be bruising around the sides of the mouth depending on the material that is used and the method of injection as well as how the body handles the foreign material. some patients can be allergic to some aspects of collagen lip injections and that can cause excessive swelling or related side effects it’s generally not a good idea to ignore the warning signs of complications from this process which could cause a patient long-term harm. consult a doctor before selecting one of these treatments to talk about lip injections or lip plumpers and what kinds of potential side effects may result.	i want larger-looking lips. should i go with a lip plumper or filler?

"you are probably not pregnant if everything you say is true but they only way to be absolutely sure is to take a pregnancy test if you miss your next period or have any other signs of pregnancy. a headache or lower abdominal pains are not definite signs of pregnancy. as a matter of fact the birth control pills can contribute to certain types of headaches. lower abdominal pain could be many other things from constipation and intestinal gas to bladder pain. this should be investigated if your symptoms persist or worsen. if you truly worried about an unintentional pregnancy insist that your boyfriend to always use a condom. (no glove. no love! ). given a firm non-negotiable choice of no sex or sex with a condom most men will use one. your birth control pill is an excellent form of contraception but it can be near-perfect if you have him use a condom. too many people don't seem to realize ""pulling out"" does not prevent pregnancy! sperm leaks out before a man fully ejaculates. not to mention ejaculation isn't that controllable. also the birth control isn't fully effective until you have taken it a full week after your period. even this isn't a solid law. things like that are affected by too many aspects. for instance: how long you have been using the same kind of birth control your diet how easily your body flushes estrogen etc. etc. i suggest you more fully educate yourself on the reproductive system and safe sex practices. nobody can tell you whether or not you are pregnant. if you want to know for sure take a pregnancy test."	am i pregnant? i had sex w/o a condom two days after my period ended and im on birth control & he said he pulled out. i've been on birth control since may my period ended two days before i had sex w/o a condom. i also started my new pack of birth control the day before. my boyfriend said he pulled out before anything happened but i'm still worried. i've been getting headaches and some lower abdominal pain as well.

you don't have to be asking any questions; let her medical provider do that for you during an examination. finding a specific cause of severe pain is more than just asking questions. it is analyzing the answers and correlating those answers with physical examination findings lab tests and imaging studies. you did not provide any information about the type of pain location etc. that your daughter was experiencing so it is important that she see a medical professional.	my daughter is 12 and is in sever pain. what kinds of questions should i be asking before seeking medical attn.
in case you didn't know it ringworm isn't caused by a worm at all. ringworm is actually a skin fungus just like athlete's foot or jock itch. you can get ringworm in a variety of ways from sharing a towel with someone who's infected to touching damp surfaces that carry the fungus. the fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm damp environments which is why it's frequently acquired in places like public pool common areas. to your question: you could catch ringworm from your friend even if you didn't touch the lesion. the reason is because the fungus could be infecting other areas of your friend's skin but not showing the characteristic ring mark yet. if you have thoroughly washed and dried the skin areas that came in contact with your friend you're probably not going to get ringworm. however be careful not to share any sports gear or towels with your friend and be sure to wear flip-flops or other foot protection if you all are bathing in a common shower area or something like that. by the way ringworm will not clear up on its own. it needs to be treated with an anti-fungal preparation. your friend can try using an over-the-counter cream for athlete's foot (the generic name is miconazole) but if that doesn't help or if the ringworm starts spreading your friend should seek medical attention. in rare instances ringworm is best treated with a prescription medication. hope this helps! my daughter caught it from her friend 5 yrs ago and it was from putting her slippers on. i never caught it tho when i rubbed the ointment on her back where it was. i immediately washed my hands tho too. i guess different people affected differently by things.	a friend contracted ringworm and i touched his skin but not the infected area. what are the chances of contracting it? . a friend of mine from a youth group i go to recently contracted ringworm on his arm. he was with the group tonight and had the area covered with a huge bandage yet he would peel the bandage off just enough for people to see the ring and then immediately put it back on. i never touched the infected area but i did come into skin-to-skin contact with him during a couple games and activities. i washed my hands face and other possible areas of contact with soap but will i get ringworm?

vitamin d is made when uv-b rays strike the skin. one general recommendation has been to have 20 minutes of sun exposure to [the] face arms legs or back twice a week during the most intense times for sun exposure (10:00 a. m. through 3:00 p. m. ). alas the amount of vitamin d that can be obtained this way can be limited by several factors. if one has dark skin uses an eight or greater spf sunscreen wears occlusive clothing or gets sun exposure only through window glass -- the amount of vitamin d is greatly decreased. if one lives above the 42nd parallel the months of november through february do not produce sufficient vitamin d even when the sun is not hidden by clouds. cloud cover shade and air pollution will further reduce the amount of uv-b. many of us prefer to get vitamins naturally from whole foods as opposed to supplements. some of the highest sources of vitamin d are listed below: cod liver oil one tablespoon = 1 360 iu. cooked salmon 3. 5 ounces = 400 iu. sardines in oil drained 1. 75 ounces = 250 iu. tuna in oil drained 3 ounces = 200 iu. vitamin d fortified orange juice 1 cup = 142 iu. vitamin d fortified milk 1 cup = 98 iu. vitamin d fortified yogurts 6 ounces = 80 iu. egg yolk one = 20 iu. for comparison the usual amount of vitamin d in a multivitamin pill is 400 iu (international units).	what are some common sources of vitamin d?

you are asking a question that could not be answered over the internet. we do not know anything about you your medical history. but more importantly we have no way of examining you and/or ordering any diagnostic tests. before attributing any medical condition to stress or anxiety a medical provider must first rule out all organic causes that could be attributed to your array of symptoms. i would strongly suggest that you see your medical provider -- someone who knows you and your medical history -- for a thorough diagnostic evaluation.	i sometimes feel breathless when sleeping on my side but i don't know if it's a health problem or just stress. over the past few weeks i've felt out-of-breath when falling asleep while lying on my right side. i wake up almost in a panic with my heart racing but i feel better when i sit up for a while and eventually can sleep like normal. this doesn't happen every night though and doesn't happen if i nap during the day. it also only started after i had a health scare (unrelated) while lying in bed which left me afraid to fall asleep. is this a real issue or just anxiety about what happened before?
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. your symptoms definitely deserve to be checked out by your health care provider. any time a person develops a symptom like widespread loss of sensation to a body area it's a good idea to get examined. you can start with your primary care provider or whoever treated your utis. because your uti cleared up over a month ago i wouldn't think your symptom is some weird side effect of antibiotics. and i don't think antiperspirant use would cause loss of sensation either though if you're spraying it directly on your groin area you could try stopping that to see if sensation improves. at any rate i'd recommend you make an appointment with your health care provider for an exam. best wishes to you!	male 47 i had uti last month treated well. i have lost sensation in groin/penis. erection/ejuculate normal. pl advise. i had uti mild and uncomplictaed twice in one year but both time treated completely. second time the uti was mild in symptoms and the only problem was pain during ejuculation. i was treated with antibiotic for 10 days. after treatment pain disappeared and i felt normal. after one month i am feeling loss of feeling in entire groin. when i pinch skin around i feel less pain. incidently i have started using anti prespirant for last one month. does this possibly cause loss of feeling?

hi yes. almost all women have more vaginal discharge in pregnancy. this is quite normal and happens for a few reasons. during pregnancy the cervix (neck of the womb) and vaginal walls get softer and discharge increases to help prevent any infections travelling up from the vagina to the womb. towards the end of pregnancy the amount of discharge increases and can be confused with urine. in the last week or so of pregnancy your discharge may contain streaks of thick mucus and some blood. this is called a 'show' and happens when the mucus that has been present in your cervix during pregnancy comes away. it's a sign that the body is starting to prepare for birth and you may have a few small 'shows' in the days before you go into labour. increased discharge is a normal part of pregnancy but it's important to keep an eye on it and tell your doctor or midwife if it changes in any way. do hope this helps you. good luck	what does having a clear discharge during pregnancy mean?
"sorry but there is a possibility that you are. it was recommended by our doctor to get the ""first response"" pregnancy test at a drug store or walmart. first response was about $20. or less. she advised us that this one is most accurate. my best advice for you as a mom is to keep a calendar. be diligent about keeping up with the start and stop days of your monthy cycle. ejaculation or not semen carries sperm also. i suggest that you get on the computer and learn all that you can about sex. if there is someone who you can trust to educate you do that for your own information and safety! std's are a really big issue. don't assume that a person is disease free because you see no ""tell tale"" signs. read as much as you can! good luck!"	am i pregnant? . so i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend one day before my period started he did not ejaculate in me and usually my period lasts about 5-7 days and my cycle is about 27 days on average is it still possible for me to become pregnant?

i do believe that your doctor has a wrong belief that surgery for a patient not on opioids is a must or better according to the american pain society new guidelines its okay to be on such drugs without a need to stop it…but i prefer not to assume anything untill you meet your doctor and discuss your concerns with him. may be he is having another justified explanation	Doctor placed an intrathecal pain pump implant for dilaudid & baclofen, is it justified?

the mental health laws are pretty clear in most areas of the country. in order to be hospitalized against your will the patient must be a danger to themselves or others. your ex-husband is too slick to allow the occurrence of involuntary commitment. it sounds like you'll always care about this man and; that's ok. after all you married this man because you loved him and he'll always be the father of your children. at one time he probably was psychiatrically well and a high quality person. but unless he gets some type of professional help you must let him go and move on with your life. he can't help being sick and apparently is not ready to seek treatment. it sounds like you went through much hurt during your marriage to this man. please consider securing some type of therapy to recover from the years of physical abuse emotional turmoil and fear. life is very short even if you life to be 100 years old. it's time to experience joy. what not start your new life of happiness today?	what do you do when the person that has schizophreina wont get help and is becomming distructive and violet. my ex husband became so horrible and violet i had to leave him and get a divorce from him. i had to go into hiding with my children just to keep us safe. the police would never help us because he was not stupid and knew just how far he could go before getting into trouble. after the divorce. i had his rights terminated. he didn't even care was stone cold like a robot. he abused us beat us mentally hurt the children and much more. so what do you do with someone like this.
herpes simplex virus can be spread in that manner if this person had herpes and you were susceptible to getting it. since many people have antibodies for herpes already from a past infection (even from a child) you may not be susceptible. if you are then keep in mind that not all exposed people will get it. if you were exposed only time will tell. herpes can take several weeks to a few months after exposure before you may see an herpetic break out. sadly brushing your teeth using listerine and wiping off that pipe beforehand did not lower your risk.	can i get herpes from sharing a pipe? . so i just shared a pipe with a friend i suspect may have a cold sore on his lip. it was a visible scab he claimed it was from hot oil on his face but lets assume it is herpes. i would wipe off the tip of the glass pipe pretty good on my shirt and waited to hit it several seconds after passed to me. i am paranoid now. i just got home and brushed my teeth and used listerine. how likely is it i have herpes now?
assuming the prescription belongs to you you're in the early part of your pregnancy and your ob/gyn knows about it then you and your baby should be ok. many women take prescription opioids such as hydrocodone during pregnancy and these appear to be pretty safe. however using any pain relievers (even over-the-counter ones) late in pregnancy (third trimester) can be risky for both mother and fetus. you should get your ob/gyn's advice and direction on this subject. keep in mind it's never ok to take narcotics that have not been prescribed to you. pregnant or not you should only take narcotics under the supervision of a doctor or other qualified medical professional. wishing you well!	is it ok to use precription opiates while pregnant

"if your clinic is no longer participating in medicare you can still get your care there but you will need to submit your bills to medicare on your own. in addition the clinic can ""balance bill"" you which means they can bill you for their expenses beyond what medicare would pay. you can try using your husband's retirement insurance as your primary coverage but most retirement policies act as a supplement to medicare -- meaning they pay after medicare does. more than likely you will need to submit your bills to medicare and wait for payment. your husband's insurance may cover the portion of the bill that exceeds medicare payment rates. i would get further clarification from your clinic that this is how it will work however."	we are in ca. i have medicare primary and am covered under my husband's retirement health insurance as second. however our clinic has informed us that it is dropping medicare. how will that affect me? will i just be able to use my husband's insurance and not use the medicare?

"there are two major reasons for very prolonged/heavy periods: hormonal and what i call ""structural. "" ""structural"" means when excessive bleeding is due to actual problems within the cavity or walls of the uterus. some examples of this would include fibroids of the uterus endometriosis of the muscular wall of the uterus (""adenomyosis"") infections of the lining of the uterus polyps of the uterine lining or even uterine cancer. hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulations. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone ""stabilizes"" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don't decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus—your missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding. another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows. simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer (causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining ) and progesterone is like the lawnmower (keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms). this is why depoprovera (high dose synthetic progesterone) brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills (relatively progesterone dominant) bring about shorter lighter periods. it is also why women who miss ovulations (no progesterone produced) are at a greater risk for too thick lining. causes for not ovulating are multifold: thyroid problems pituitary problems ovarian cysts physical stressors (e. g. sudden increases in exercise crash dieting) emotional stressors (problems with spouses kids job money) increased body weight anorexia rotating shifts at work etc. if they are sending you for an ultrasound that can accomplish two things. an ultrasound should be able to visualize fibroids of the uterus or suggest polyps. an ultrasound can also measure the thickness of your uterine lining. a very thick lining can suggest a hormonal cause like missed ovulations. an ultrasound should be able to visualize an ovarian cyst if that was the cause of missed ovulations. lastly . as we age ovulations tend to decrease--or if they occur the amount of progesterone produced may be less. structural causes such as fibroids or polyps also tend to be more common as we age. hopefully you will get a more ""for sure"" answer after your ultrasound."	why do i have heavy bleeding for 2-3 weeks when i get my period? my doctor is supposed to send me for an ultrasound.
new research found that ldl “bad” cholesterol is lowered most when plant sterols are consumed in smaller amounts more often throughout the day rather than in one large amount each day. in the group of people who received plant sterols three times per day their ldl cholesterol decreased by 6% which was attributed to a significant reduction in cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. the average american diet contains around 250 to 500 milligrams of plant sterols per day but some research suggests striving for 2 000 milligrams. plant sterols are found naturally in small amounts in many plants food you know and love including whole grains fruits nuts and vegetables. but the foods that have impressive amounts include: avocado 1 small = 132 mg plant sterols soybeans 1 cup = 90 mg plant sterols chickpeas 1/2 cup = 25 mg plant sterols almonds 1 ounce = 34 mg plant sterols extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon = 30 mg plant sterols	what foods are high in plant sterols?

i am so sorry that you went on web md for advice about your dog. hopefully you took your dog to the vet in time. yes dogs can get congestive heart failure. weight gain is a sign more in the chest area as you had said your dog was gaining. there is no reason a dog would gain like that on the same amount of food or cutting back on the food except if you went from given exercise to zero exercise. the only other reason is medical. the weight gain is from fluid retention most likely. they could also be suffering from another issue. that is how it happened in my dog she looked very heavy in the chest. the most common cause for it is advanced cancer. with my dog she lost weight even still her chest looked larger. the tumor was in her throat and she had trouble keeping food down. unfortunately just like in people the most you can do is make them comfortable drugs that help expel the fluids and as long as your dog is happy and pain free love them as much as you can until it is time to put them down. you should never let your dog suffer and trust me you will know when it is time. i truly am sorry you were given such a extremely uneducated answer but it is web md and not vet md. they possibly thought that it was the correct answer not sure how possibly they never owned a dog before.

atopic dermatitis affects each child differently both in terms of onset and severity of symptoms. in infants atopic dermatitis typically begins around 6 weeks to 12 weeks of age. it may first appear around the cheeks and chin as a patchy facial rash which can progress to red scaling oozing skin. the skin may become infected. once the infant becomes more mobile and begins crawling exposed areas such as the knees and elbows may also be affected. an infant with atopic dermatitis may be restless and irritable because of the itching and discomfort. many infants improve by 18 months of age although they remain at greater than normal risk for dry skin or hand eczema later in life. in childhood the rash tends to occur behind the knees and inside the elbows on the sides of the neck and on the wrists ankles and hands. often the rash begins with papules that become hard and scaly when scratched. the skin around the lips may be inflamed and constant licking of the area may lead to small painful cracks. severe cases of atopic dermatitis may affect growth and the child may be shorter than average. the disease may go into remission (disease-free period). the length of a remission varies and it may last months or even years. in some children the disease gets better for a long time only to come back at the start of puberty when hormones stress and the use of irritating skin care products or cosmetics may cause the condition to flare. although a number of people who developed atopic dermatitis as children also experience symptoms as adults it is less common (but possible) for the disease to show up first in adulthood. the pattern in adults is similar to that seen in children; that is the disease may be widespread or limited. in some adults only the hands or feet may be affected and become dry itchy red and cracked. sleep patterns and work performance may be affected and longterm use of medications to treat the condition may cause complications. adults with atopic dermatitis also have a predisposition toward irritant contact dermatitis especially if they are in occupations involving frequent hand wetting hand washing or exposure to chemicals. some people develop a rash around their nipples. these localized symptoms are difficult to treat and people often do not tell their doctor because of modesty or embarrassment. adults may also develop cataracts that are difficult to detect because they cause no symptoms. therefore the doctor may recommend regular eye exams.	what are the stages of atopic dermatitis?

you should have a pre-op appointment with your surgeon's nurse (or physician assistant) and/or a nurse at the facility where your knee replacement will occur. these nurses should answer all your questions about pre-operative medication regimens whether or not to take lantus the day of your surgery when to stop eating before surgery and so on. in general people with blood sugar problems can experience longer healing times. i'd recommend asking your surgeon (or his/her nurse or physician assistant) what to expect in terms of possible problems healing. because your a1c is good you may not experience any problems at all. be sure to follow all your surgeon's printed instructions for post-op care of the wound. i suggest you write down all your questions for the pre-op appointment. be sure you receive printed instructions for before and after the surgery. if any of your questions aren't answered in advance feel free to call your surgeon's office for clarification. hope this helps!	i have diabetes and am going to have knee replacement surgery what do i need to know and what can i expect. i have type 2 diabetes. i am going to have knee replacement surgery in january. while my a1c is 6. 0 my daily sugar levels are all over the place. so much so that my dr. has had to increase my insulin. i take lantus 5 units in the morning and 55 units at suppertime and 7 units of novolog at suppertime. what do i need to know about this surgery and what can i expect from my diabetes? thank you.

i'm sorry you're feeling worried about this. let me see if i can help. first of all i'd strongly recommend you discuss your concerns with your doctor. he or she is in the best position to help get you on a course to lower your cholesterol and triglyceride numbers and get your blood sugar under better control. diet medications and a support group can all help in that effort. regarding the result of your lipase test specifically i'm not sure why a result of 90 would get flagged as high. usually the reference range for lipase runs between 10-40 units per liter (u/l) for adults under age 60 and between 18-180 u/l for adults over age 60. even if your lipase results are abnormally high i wouldn't jump right to a conclusion of cancer. several conditions can cause elevated lipase numbers including inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) gallbladder problems and peptic ulcers -- just to name a few. your doctor is really the only person who can help you get an accurate diagnosis but i hope this response puts your mind at ease a bit. best wishes to you! my lipase levels were higher than that and it was because of gall stones. at first it felt like i had gas that wouldn't pass. i had my gall bladder removed and within 3 mos. i was back to normal.	my lipase levels are 90; outside the normal reference range for quest diagnostics. how concerned need i be? . i also have high cholesterol high triglycerides and 9. 9 a1c. my greatest fear is pancreatic cancer.

most helpful answer great question! sorry to hear about your concussion though. i hope you've been taking things easy as your brain heals. tylenol (generic name: acetaminophen) with codeine is fine to take even if you have a concussion. in fact it's a better choice than something like ibuprofen because tylenol with codeine does not thin the blood. by the way your concussion symptoms should clear up by the three-week mark. if you're still experiencing any symptoms at that time it would be a good idea to get checked out by a health care provider to make sure you didn't hurt your head worse than you thought. also whenever you have a question about a medication's usage you can call and speak to a pharmacist. if he or she can't give you specific information (such as the safety of taking tylenol-iii when you have a concussion) feel free to call your primary care provider's office and ask to speak with a nurse there. they're always happy to help. best wishes to you!	can you take tylenol and codeine #3 while you have a concussion? . my doctor prescribed me with tylenol and codeine #3 for a reoccuring stomach problem ive had over the past 5 years. i got a concussion two weeks ago and today i just happen to be experiencing my stomach problem. i am wondering if it is ok to take this medicine while concussed. thanks

yes it is possible you could still get pregnant plus your hormones are probibly off which may be an explanation to being emotional but the cramping could be that your body is trying to have a cycle or your uterus is contracting to make room for a baby take a pregnancy test by at least your 6th week after you had intercourse.	i just went off the pill after my last cycle. is is possible i got pregnant within 2 weeks of going off the pill? . only been off pill for 2 weeks. using no other birth control. i had a reg pd last month - i am not due to have a pd for 2 more weeks. have been perfectly regulated for years. have been unchracteristically emotional the last week or so slight cramping occassionally.
blood in the semen is almost always nothing at all. it is a symptom of a small blood vessel probably breaking often during sex sometimes when men are bearing down with heavy lifting or straining sometimes with a difficult bowel movement if they’re constipated sometimes for no reason at all. so bright red blood in the semen speckled pink brown that happens. and unless it’s serious meaning it’s heavy and prolonged we just ignore it. it’s is not something to be worried about. it’s very scary. especially if you don’t know what to expect and suddenly you see blood in the semen then you panic. but it’s rarely a problem. now if you’re an older guy it could be a sign of prostate cancer or a kind of bladder cancer. but i’ve only seen that once in 20 years. it’s almost always nothing. in fact some of the major textbooks don’t even address the matter of seminal blood.	what does it mean if i have blood in my semen?

the most likely reason is that one of your previous sexual partners has not experienced the hpv infection (most women don't) and if you're not looking for them (regular physicals) there can be some that small that your doctor wouldn't see them with his/her eyes only. there is a tiny tiny chance that you had a wart on your hands or some other part of the body that you cut and then spread the virus to your genitals (the doc told me that he sees this pretty much only when women shave and spread the virus with the razor because both sites have miniscule nics). but this is so unlikely that i would say it has to be your partners.	causes of genital warts without sex? . i'm a male and i went into the doctor's to see about what i thought was acne around my genitals (just above my penis). he told me it was warts caused by hpv and despite me practicing safe sex a condom doesn't protect against it. but i've contacted my previous 4 sexual partners. in the years since we've been together they've all been tested for different reasons: pregnancy cancer abortion and regular physicals. . how else could i have gotten them?

immuno-suppressants for long duration are generally prescribed in rheumatoid arthritis. but long use of allopathic immuno-suppressants do have side effects. alternative system of medicine do provide best treatment for arthrirtis. group of medications called immunomodulators in ayurveda are preferred over potent immuno suppressants in allopathy. generally as a rule it is better to go for ayurvedic natural therapies in disorders of chronic nature. for mild arthritis you can follow the changes to diet and routine that can reverse the effects of this crippling disease. exclude processed foods sugar and gluten and include organic vegetables grass-fed meat and fish in your diet. eat at scheduled times. improving gut functioning may also help in chronic diseases	what is the best pain and other management for severe arthritis of the spine? . i had been having severe back pain for awhile and my doctors kept giving me different pain meds and other meds to help and it did for awhile but then the pain kept coming back stronger than before. so finally i changed doctors and went to her and said i wanted an m. r. i. on my back because at night my back hurt so bad and my hips to my legs would go numb i get alot of charlie horses so i had the m. r. i. and it came back as server arthritis in my spine. im 30 my spine is of an 40-45 yr old

yes it could cause the baby harm. according to nbc’s nightly news and numerous other sources a clinical study has revealed that smoke on indoor surfaces like carpets upholstery and even clothing can mix with the air to create a cancer concern. a chemical reaction can occur when the 3rd hand residue of cigarette smoke interacts with nitrous acid to form a carcinogenic substance. this type of pollution is particularly threatening to infants and toddlers. the other grandmother needs to be made aware of the danger posed to her innocent grandchild through this underappreciated type of toxic exposure. someone perhaps the grandmother’s son or daughter can gently and seriously present the reality of her holding a child while ridden with smoke infected clothing and hair (she almost certainly is unaware of the inherent harm being created).	my 6 month old grandson's other grandma smokes heavily her clothes reek. will this harm the baby when she holds him

"have you tried to swaddle her? my kids always woke themselves up by twitching in their sleep and hitting themselves. we got a ""swaddle blanket"" and it worked wonders. you could use a regular receiving blanket. open the blanket up and lay flat fold in half diagonally so you have a large triangle. put baby so her shoulders are slightly above the longest side( this should be the center of the blanket) tuck the point of the triangle into her feet wrap the right side in all the way over her and under if you have that much slack making sure that her arm is inside the blanket then do the same to the other side making sure again that her arm is under the blanket. it keeps them from swatting themselves and may keep them sleeping longer. good luck"	how long is it ok to let my 1 year old cry it out. my 1 year old daughter awakes every night at like 3 am and will not go back to sleep in till 5 or 6 am and i have tried every thing rocking her giving her pain releaver to make shore shes not in pain i have gone to the doctors several times no answers there nothings wrong but you can tell shes still tired she is fussy and will close her eyes and then she starts to hit herself and kick me to keep her self awake.

you're wise to ask these questions. drug interactions can be fatal so it's always a good idea to check things out before taking medications -- including over-the-counter ones. note you can always call a pharmacist to answer these questions too. most communities have a 24-hour pharmacy and pharmacists always are happy to respond to questions like yours. if the medication your daughter is taking contains only loratadine and only guaifenesin it should be ok. many products that contain guaifenesin also contain other ingredients (like acetaminophen). but in general loratadine and guaifenesin should not interact with each other since they are in different drug classifications. loratadine is an antihistamine and guaifenesin thins the mucus. obviously any person can be allergic to any ingredient in a medication so always be alert for signs of a serious allergic reaction such as hives difficulty breathing or swelling of the lips/tongue. wishing you (and your daughter) well!	my 20yr old daughter took a 24hr loratadine 10mg 9hrs ago. could she take a 12hr 1200mg guaifenesin?
no! there has not been sufficient testing done on the effects of using a whitening gel while pregnant. until such studies have been done on a larger scale it is best to err on the side of caution. manufacturers of teeth whitening products and teeth bleaching products generally recommend against using them during pregnancy for liability reasons. however common sense dictates that unnecessarily ingesting anything should be especially avoided during pregnancy.	can you whiten your teeth while pregnant?

two ultrasound studies of women who exercised their vaginal muscles did find that their muscles were thicker and stronger after pelvic floor muscle training. among women with urine leakage their thinner muscles became the thickness of healthy women's pelvic floor muscles. additionally they had less urine leakage -- whether the problem was from stress or urge types of incontinence. the use of vaginal cones and/or kegel exercises to increase muscle strength were both found to improve tone and decrease urine loss. while some of these studies did not measure vaginal tightness per se when muscle bulk is increased a woman can voluntarily contract those muscles to make the vaginal opening tighter. yes it will tighten that area. i guarentee you! contract and relax those muscles repeatedly 7 to 10 times then hold tightly/contract for as long as you can while sitting at a stop light in your car at the office watching tv or when ever you think about it and you will notice results quickly and so will your partner. if you can't always do it for that long of a time or that many reps don't worry. any added amount will make a difference. yes it will make them tighter. that's the exercise my gynecologist told me to do after i had a baby. it really worked for me my husband could tell the difference. if you don't know how to do them you hold in the muscles that you use if you had to pee for a few seconds then release then hold again. you can do them all day at your desk home or driving in your car. the more you use these muscles the quicker you'll see results. i think so yes. in addition i have found that if your legs are in good shape because you exercise regulary then it tends to tighten up your pelvic floor muscles to. just my own personal experience of course. yes it will make them tighter. that's the exercise my gynecologist told me to do after i had a baby. it really worked for me my husband could tell the difference. if you don't know how to do them you hold in the muscles that you use if you had to pee for a few seconds then release then hold again. you can do them all day at your desk home or driving in your car. the more you use those muscles the quicker your results.	will exercising the vaginal muscles make my vagina tighter?

rosacea is a very interesting condition. we sometimes also call it adult acne but it's really two different things. so the thing about rosacea is that you do have some control. there are environmental stimuli that can trigger rosacea. so it's important to know what can turn it on and then we can figure out how to turn it off as well. triggers for rosacea tend to be extremes in temperature. so if you go from a very hot environment to a very cold environment or vice versa that can be an extreme trigger for rosacea. probably the biggest trigger for rosacea is alcohol and it can be any type of alcohol but some people notice it more with red wine. also stress can be a very big trigger for rosacea. so you have to manage your stress. obviously we can't live without stress because life would be no fun at all but you have to be able to moderate your stress so that you can handle it better and so it won't show in your skin. once you have that under control as much as possible then you can look for products that are fragrance free and dye free because anything that irritates your skin can also bring out rosacea. so that will be a great starting point. if that alone doesn't help then you might have to go to prescription type products that can help. i like retinoids for treatment of rosacea but you have to do it very gently. topical metronidazole in a prescription form can also be very helpful and salt-based medicines can be very helpful. one other trigger for rosacea can be spicy foods. then some people have their own personal triggers. some people will say chocolate is a trigger or vinegar or some vegetables. so you have to sort of know your own personal triggers as well and try to avoid them. hello you did not say if you we're a man or woman but i have rosacea and i have found that murad products have helped me a great deal. i rarely ever have a breakout now unless i am in the sun a lot. the murad that i use is essential-c day moisturizer broad spectrum spf30/pa +++ orange lettering. second i use murad invisiblur perfecting shield broad spectrum spf 30 pa +++ this is purple lettering. i do not need any of the other products so i do not use them as they are very expensive. also after using the inviiblur perfecting shield i found that i no longer need any makeup or powder on my face other then lipstick and eye liner. good luck.	i have rosacea. my skin is too sensitive to use a lot of products. how do i pick ones that won't irritate my skin?

there are so many possibilities that it would not be in your best interest for me or any medical provider to blindly guess. a description is not sufficient to make this important call. even dermaologists often cannot determine the true nature of a skin lesion just by looking at it. sometimes it need to be removed (biopsy) to have a pathologist examine it under a powerful microscope. whether than worry that this might be a skin cancer of some sort i would highly recommend that you see a dermatologist. you have worried about this weird skin lesion for two years so it is time that you take it this one more important step and allow a professional to address your concern.	weird bump on skin that changed from pink to brown and developed a sore it is firm and not painful. what could it be? . this bump developed a few years ago. it doesn't hurt but sometimes the skin around it gets very sensitive and feels like it's burning. it doesn't hurt but it has changed color and it developed a wound when i don't remember injuring myself there. it kind of worries me. any idea?
unfortunately without the ability to actually see this skin eruption that you are describing it would be very difficult if not impossible to blindly offer an accurate diagnosis. a diagnosis is really essential when it comes to treatment. knowing your medical history will also help solve this mystery rash. based solely on your description this could be an allergic reaction perhaps urticaria (hives). hives are intensely itchy comes on suddenly and if the allergen is still in your midst it can continue to persist/spread. regardless of the cause (which can be very challenging to find) the itchiness can be treated with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine (benadryl) or other over-the-counter medications in this class. seeing a medical provider is important since many things can mimic hives. this sounds like pitariasis rosea. which usually spreads to the trunk of the body. bathe in selson blue it could be from a plant or some kind of poison oak that you wern't aware of may be in your yard? some body's house or being out in the woods you have the same thing almost like i have going on with me. but mine is on my right inner thigh itchy raised dry rash. i'm just using over the counter anti-itch cream good luck.	i have a skin rash that looks like ringworm but isn't. its red and very itchy and spreading everywhere. what can i do? . my breakout started with one bump on my thigh then a day later there were two on my upper body. then all of a sudden the next week my whole upper body was covered in red raised and itchy bumps. i am into my second week with this and it is spreading to my face all over my arms and moving down my legs. i am not in pain but it is hard to deal with being itchy everywhere. i don't have any other symptoms. if there was a way to know what i have? just anything to help thank you.
backaches are usually caused by the strain put on the back muscles changing hormone levels and changes in your posture. recommendations: wear low-heeled (but not flat) shoes. avoid lifting heavy objects. squat down with your knees bent when picking things up instead of bending down at the waist. don't stand on your feet for long periods. if you need to stand for long periods place one foot on a stool or box for support. sit in a chair with good back support or place a small pillow behind your lower back. also place your feet on a footrest or stool. check that your bed is firm. if needed put a board between the mattress and box spring. sleep on your left or right side with a pillow between your legs for support. apply a hot water bottle heating pad on low setting take a warm bath or shower or try massage. perform exercises as advised by your health care provider to make your back muscles stronger and help relieve the soreness. maintain good posture. standing up straight will ease the strain on your back. contact your health care provider if you have a low backache that goes around your stomach and does not go away within one hour after you change position or rest. this might be a sign of premature labor.	what can i do about backaches during pregnancy?

this must probably be your first child that is why this query. please note that children under the age of six months may pass stools either 10 to 15 times a month or once in 2 to 3 days. and it is absolutely normal. you should be worried only if the child has not passed stools is vomiting and has abdominal distention. otherwise it is fine. also you can give neopeptine (combination of simethicone amylase and papain) and decolic (combination of diazepam and dicyclomine) when required. no harm would be done. for further queries consult a paediatrician online --> <link>	Hello doctor,My 2 month old daughter started passing stool irregularly, from the past eight days. She was passing a lot of gas, but it did not smell. Seeing no improvement, we took her to the pediatrician, who said she had gas in her stomach. So, he gave her Decolic, Neopeptine, and Glycerin suppository. When we came back home, we applied Glycerin suppository and had an immediate effect, and she passed a good amount of stool. It was yellow in color, sticky, and semisolid. But again after that, she did not potty for three and a half days. So, we again applied the suppository today, which made her potty. Is she suffering from constipation? Is this common, as she is exclusively on breastfeeding? Is the use of suppository safe for her? Will it cause any harm in the future? Is there any permanent and natural solution?

nope! you can't get pregnant via anal sex unless your partner ejaculated over your vulvar-vaginal area and even then it would be very unlikely. a quick anatomy lesson: the anus leads in to the rectum which is the name for the very last segment of the large intestine (bowel). the intestines are totally separate structures from the reproductive anatomy. releasing sperm into the bowel cannot result in pregnancy. do be careful though not to strain your abdominal muscles too much yet. a surgeon once told me it takes about six weeks for scar tissue to equal the strength of suture so you still have some healing to do from that c-section. wishing you well!	i had anal sex after having a csection 3 weeks ago can i get pregnant?

"""it depends on the doctor's relationship with the insurance company "" says richard e. ungar a los angeles-based health-care attorney. that relationship can make the difference between balance billing (not allowed) and billing you for a balance you owe (completely kosher). is your doc in or out? a health-care provider who is in-network with your insurance company has negotiated a price for his or her medical services and signed a contract with your insurer agreeing to those rates as payment in-full. with the exception of your co-pay deductible or coinsurance in-network providers generally cannot charge you more for their services. doing so is considered balance billing whether or not you've signed a form stating you'll pay the balance of what your insurer won't. but that's not the end of the story. there are scenarios in which you may be required to pay beyond what your insurance company will even if the doctor is in your carrier's network. duped by details there are details consumers commonly overlook about the rules of their insurance coverage that cause trouble says marty rosen executive vice president and co-founder of health advocate a healthcare advocacy and assistance organization. forgetting the common requirement to pre-certify services before receiving care is a frequent mistake. another is not confirming ahead of time whether you're being treated by doctors in your insurance carrier's network. ""failure to do so may result in denial of coverage by your insurance company and thus large out-of-pocket fees "" rosen says. also watch for certain elements of a doctor's visit that your insurance coverage may not cover ungar warns. for example let's say you see an in-network doctor for a routine colonoscopy. both the doctor visit and the procedure may be fully covered by your insurer. but if your doctor decides to use a newer sedative that requires an anesthesiologist to administer it (as opposed to doing it herself) unger says you could be on the hook for the anesthesiologist's charges. in order to avoid unnecessary health care costs before you get care: * make sure the service you need is covered. * determine exactly what the contracted service includes. * confirm that the doctor is in your network. and don't sign any documents you don't understand or don't feel comfortable with."	what are your legal obligations to pay your doctor for treatment above and beyond what your insurance will pay?
not all blood tests have to be fasting. depending on the type of test that is ordered (not something you have shared) your doctor may have ordered blood tests that can be done on random non-fasting samples. glucose lipids (cholesterol) etc. all should be done fasting but a cbc (complete blood count) does not require fasting. as an example.	my gp never has me fast for any blood tests why is that? . for years my gp has never had me fast for any blood work others have why is that?
i am not sure what you mean by your vague question. if your boyfriend is a responsible adult he should be taking care of himself. living in his own place paying rent/mortgage cooking his own meals working etc. if you are referring to masturbation than you need to say so. don't be jealous of a masturbating boyfriend. he is not cheating on you by pleasuring himself. if your sex life has suffered because he prefers masturbation over intimacy then you need to have a heart-to-heart talk to see how you might spice up your relationship. this starts with open communication. you have to talk about it.	i have been with my boyfriend now for eight years and it seems like he would rather take care of him self.

the sequence of events here is a little unclear to me. it sounds like you had your gallbladder removed recently and also have other symptoms that sound unrelated to your gallbladder problem. if you had your gallbladder removed recently and you have three or four small incisions (including one in your belly button) then you had laparoscopic surgery. during this procedure several small incisions are made in your abdomen and instruments are inserted through them. to make this process work your abdomen is inflated with harmless carbon dioxide gas. the unfortunate side effect of this gas is post-surgery bloating and sometimes pain. at times the pain can occur in the shoulder area. this is normal and should go away within several days. vomiting after gallbladder surgery also is not uncommon. if you follow a lower-fat diet it should help with the vomiting issue. if you had gallbladder surgery recently you should be scheduled for follow-up appointments with your surgeon. please keep these appointments. your surgeon will be able to tell you if your recovery is progressing normally. the pimples and sores in your underarm thigh and nipple area do not sound like they're related to your gallbladder issues. digestive system issues usually do not manifest as skin problems. i would suggest you consult a dermatologist (or even your primary care physician) to take a look at these lesions to find out what they are and what's causing them. i hope this helps and wish you all the best!	after surgery i am still bloated (pressure) acid reflux and now constipation what gives? . i never had the pain associated but vomited everything i ate. went from 230lbs to now 177lbs lost all first 3 months but went a year before surgery for lack of insurance. during that year began to have frequent fevers and sores resembling pimples without heads on my underarms thigh area and chest closer to the nipple areas. i feel this is all linked and afraid of more than just gallstones maybe more with digestive system? please help becoming concerned and afraid of doctors?
"well it certainly could be a cyst. or it could be half a dozen other things i can think of off the top of my head. our skin is prone to developing many types of weird lumps and bumps. the good news is most of the time these go away on their own. sometimes they burst and emit fluid. other times they just seem to disappear. as long as you do not develop a fever or an angry hot red rash in the area it's probably ok to take a wait-and-see attitude with this bump at your bikini line. you can put some warm compresses on it to see if that helps ""draw out"" any exudate (gunk) from the cyst (or whatever it is). do not squeeze or puncture the bump in an attempt to drain it. that is a great way to get an infection. instead just monitor the lump. if it bursts on its own that's fine -- put some antibiotic ointment on the wound (assuming you're not allergic to antibiotic ointment) and cover it with an adhesive bandage. do that for a couple of days or until the wound has finished draining. in the unlikely event you develop a fever an angry rash in the area or if the bump doesn't go away within a couple of weeks then get a medical professional to look at it. wishing you well!"	how do you tell the difference between a cyst and something else? . i found a nickel sized lump on my bikini line that hurts and is solid with a little give at the touch like cysts i've had before do but the skin above it is redish and looks bruised. is it possible it's something more like a tumor or just a cyst that caused a bruise when forming?
"yes many woman ""spot"" when they are first pregnant. best action to take is get tested to see if you are pregnant. perhaps going to a doctor to have this done would be best as they can also advise you on the bleeding or spotting while you are there. if you aren't very far along i would suggest you ask for a blood test they are very accurate and can detect pregnancy very early on."	i'm bleeding but having pregnancy symptoms. could i be pregnant? . i was on the pill but missed a few. by the time i realized that i missed pills it was too late. i started having some of the symptoms of early pregnancy. i started bleeding 6 days after i was supposed to get my period. it was heavy the first two days but is now very light. i am still having some symptoms of early pregnancy such as nausea and sensitivity to scents and foods. could i be pregnant?

no she wont get pregnant. the vagina is full of toxic chemicals to kill of bacteria and even semen. about 70% semen from a full ejaculation is killed from the natural toxic chemicals created by the female reproductive system even before it reaches the uterus. so if i were you i wouldn't stress out too much about your girlfriend getting pregnant cause the chances of your semen reaching an egg is about a 1/10000 chance.	could my girlfriend get pregnant if the small amount of semen i had on my hand made contact with the vulva? . me an my girlfriend were performing manual sex and as we are youngish we have decided this is all we would do she performed a handjob on me and i cummed and then about 3 minutes after i rubbed her clitorus and vulva with my hand which (from what i remember) contained a slight bit of semen do i have a risk of pregnancy? she was not on her period or in the stages of ovulation.
hi yes forgot the last bit your find that most women never see implantation bleeding which for most is just spotting around day 21 if its a 28 period. so if the bleed lasted a few days it would have been your period come early. ok good luck	can i get pregnant if a boy touched his penis and then fingered me and i don't even know if there was pre cum on it? . this boy and i hooked up and he fingered me and i blew him. i'm worried that he might've touched his penis and then fingered me because i am super paranoid that pre cum could have got on his finger. if it did it would be the tiniest bit because i didn't even see him touch it. when he pulled down his pants what if he touched his penis there and got an accidental little touch of pre cum then fingered me? i got my period a week early but it was heavy to fill tampons. is it implantation bleeding?

"a transient ischemic attack (tia mini-stroke) is a short-lived stroke that gets better and resolves. it is a short-lived episode (less than 24 hours) of temporary impairment if brain function that is caused by a loss of blood supply. a tia causes a loss of function in the area of the body that is controlled by the portion of the brain affected. the loss of blood supply to the brain is most often caused by a clot that spontaneously forms in a blood vessel within the brain (thrombosis). however it can also result from a clot that forms elsewhere in the body dislodges from that location and travels to lodge in an artery of the brain (emboli). a spasm and rarely a bleed are other causes of a tia. many people refer to a tia as a ""mini-stroke. "" some tias develop slowly while others develop rapidly. by definition all tias resolve within 24 hours. strokes take longer to resolve than tias and with strokes complete function may never return and reflect a more permanent and serious problem. although most tias often last only a few minutes all tias should be evaluated with the same urgency as a stroke in an effort to prevent recurrences and/or strokes. tias can occur once multiple times or precede a permanent stroke. a transient ischemic attack should be considered an emergency because there is no guarantee that the situation will resolve and function will return. a tia from a clot in the blood vessel that supplies the retina of the eye can cause temporary visual loss (amaurosis fugax) which is often described as the sensation of a curtain coming down. a tia that involves the carotid artery (the largest blood vessel supplying the brain) can produce problems with movement or sensation on one side of the body which is the side opposite to the actual blockage. an affected patient may experience temporary double vision dizziness (vertigo) loss of balance one sided weakness or complete paralysis of the arm leg face or one whole side of the body or be unable to speak or understand commands."	what is a transient ischemic attack?

doctors often can easily recognize ringworm by its ring-shaped rash. your doctor will probably also look at a skin sample ( koh preparation ) under a microscope to confirm that fungus is present. tests for ringworm of the skin include: a koh (potassium hydroxide) preparation. this test can help your doctor find out whether a fungus is causing your rash. the doctor will take a sample of your skin by lightly scraping the infected area. the sample is placed on a slide with potassium hydroxide (koh) solution and gently heated. if fungus cells are present the doctor can then see them with a microscope. a fungal culture ( skin culture ). this test can identify the type of fungus that is causing your infection. usually a culture is only done if the diagnosis is difficult or the skin condition is not responding to treatment. this test may take up to 4 weeks because it takes time for the fungus to grow. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for ringworm of the skin?

urinary tract infections in men are very rare. stds in men are unfortunately not rare. a urinary tract infection (uti) does not cause puss to be seeping from his penis. this is most likely to be gonorrhea or the very least chlamydia. occasionally a man can have a penile discharge from prostatitis. tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea can take a few days (assuming the er ordered them which i hope they did). at first the urine can look like an uti but my skeptical eyebrows are definitely high. i would suspect and std until otherwise proven by a lab test. if your boyfriend is or may be having unprotected sex with others then you need to go and be tested. a simple urine test will determine if you have an std. no sex or sex only with condoms until you get some definitive answers.	my boyfriend has a severe bladder infection. did he get it from having sexual intercourse w/a female? . my boyfriend is circumcised. he has puss constantly seeping from his penis. he went to er and they tested his urine and the diagnosis was a bladder infection. the physician told him its more like an std because he got it from having sexual intercourse with a female.

"hi this piece below is from the mayo clinic it may just help you understand your problem but as you read its not a really bad problem. arcus senilis is common in older adults. it's caused by fat (lipid) deposits deep in the edge of the cornea. it isn't related to high cholesterol however. arcus senilis doesn't affect vision nor does it require treatment. eye problems caused by high cholesterol are uncommon — typically affecting only people who have severe cases of high cholesterol and high triglycerides passed down through families (familial hyperlipidemia). high cholesterol is more likely associated with a similar gray or white arc visible around the entire cornea (circumferential arcus) in younger adults. treatment is generally aimed at controlling cholesterol and triglyceride levels. the average person who has high cholesterol doesn't develop an arc of any type. if you're concerned about eye health and high cholesterol talk to your doctor. answer fromthomas behrenbeck md phd. a high blood cholesterol level increases your risk of coronary artery disease. lower cholesterol is usually better but in rare cases having a very low level of low-density lipoprotein (ldl or ""bad"") cholesterol or a very low total cholesterol level has been associated with some health problems. doctors are still trying to find out more about the connection between low cholesterol and health risks. there is no consensus on how to define very low ldl cholesterol but ldl would be considered very low if it is less than 40 milligrams per deciliter of blood. although the risks are rare very low levels of ldl cholesterol may be associated with an increased risk of: cancer hemorrhagic stroke depression anxiety preterm birth and low birth weight if your cholesterol is low while you're pregnant the potential risk of lowering ldl cholesterol to very low levels has not been confirmed and its association with certain health risks is still under debate. in some cases it is not clear if low cholesterol causes the health problem or the other way around. for example people with depression may have low cholesterol levels but it has not been proved that lowering cholesterol with statin therapy causes depression. however the benefits of lowering total and ldl cholesterol have been demonstrated extensively particularly in individuals with heart disease or at high risk of heart disease or stroke. if you're concerned about your cholesterol level consult your doctor. if you're taking statins don't stop without first consulting your doctor. he or she can determine the cholesterol range most appropriate for you. answer from francisco lopez-jimenez m. d. so it would not be your hdl good cholesterol its just from ldl bad cholesterol it would be best you get a blood test done on your cholesterol. hope this helps you. good luck"	i understand that arcus senilis is a result of high cholesterol. is this true for both good and bad cholesterol? . i've had a white rim around my eye that looks like arcus senilis. i do have very high good cholesterol and very low bad cholesterol.

a fatty liver is reversible. being overweight is one of the many causes for this condition. lose some weight and lose some liver fat. hypothyroidism should not interfere with your losing weight objective. in order to maintain a weight of 200 pounds you're consuming about 1844 calories per day. to reduce your weight by one (1) pound per week reduce your daily calories to about 1344. here is my abbreviated version of a plan that will enable you to eat better and lose some of the excess weight. : - begin by seeing your family doctor and obtain approval to start a reduced calorie diet. eliminating 500 calories from your daily diet can be challenging but will also prove to be rewarding and is achievable. - search the web for free 1300 daily printable diet plans. look for one that includes at least seven (7) days of planning covering three (3) meals per day and snacks. some of these diet plans may even include a printable shopping list and recipes to complete the main courses for each meal. look for diets that use a safe breakdown of calories (55% carbs -15% protein- 30% fats). - drink at least 64 oz. of water each day. - with your doctor's approval start a modest exercise program. a brisk walk will burn about 100 calories per mile while gardening will burn an additional 100 calories in 30 minutes. - take steps to learn dieting do's and do not's. do not skip meals but do learn how to substitute one food for another and how to order a meal at the restaurant while not sabotaging your diet. - keep a diary of foods and beverages consumed along with a record of your weight losses. - reward yourself for accomplishing diet goal objectives (have your nails manicured and painted get a new hair style or purchase a new handbag). - consider joining a dieting support group. you'll hear success stories make new friends and will learn additional tips to making dieting a positive self-improvement venture. best wishes for your success.

so many men and women are vit d deficient. i'd recommend to everyone to have your level checked next time you go to the doctor and keep monitoring [it]. vit d is one of the fat-soluble vitamins (a d e k are the 4 fat-solubles). therefore in order to absorb this vitamin you need to make sure you're ingesting some food that contains fat--- some nuts a 2% dairy product a slice of avocado a serving of peanut butter etc. therefore you need to have something to eat that contains fat in it for optimal absorption. any meal or snack will do. monitor your vit d levels at least once a year if you've been treated for a deficiency. this is a powerful little vitamin and we must have adequate levels.	what time of day should vitamin d be taken?
swine flu (swine influenza) is a respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that infect the respiratory tract of pigs and result in nasal secretions a barking-like cough decreased appetite and listless behavior. swine flu produces most of the same symptoms in pigs as human flu produces in people. swine flu can last about one to two weeks in pigs that survive. swine influenza virus was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in the u. s. and has been recognized by pork producers and veterinarians to cause infections in pigs worldwide. in a number of instances people have developed the swine flu infection when they are closely associated with pigs (for example farmers pork processors) and likewise pig populations have occasionally been infected with the human flu infection. in most instances the cross-species infections (swine virus to man; human flu virus to pigs) have remained in local areas and have not caused national or worldwide infections in either pigs or humans. unfortunately this cross-species situation with influenza viruses has had the potential to change. investigators think the 2009 swine flu strain first seen in mexico should be termed novel h1n1 flu since it is mainly found infecting people and exhibits two main surface antigens h1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and n1 (neuraminidase type1). recent investigations show the eight rna strands from novel h1n1 flu have one strand derived from human flu strains two from avian (bird) strains and five from swine strains.	what is swine flu (novel h1n1 influenza a swine flu)?

congratulations on your new hair growth! your objective at this time is to maintain and nurture your current hair and scalp. just like our body requires nutrition so does your hair. essential nutrients such as biotin magnesium folate and zinc are required to maintain optimum follicle growth. it's important to maintain the natural oils in your scalp and avoid excessive drying of your scalp. do not wash your hair more than once or twice per week. when you wash your hair use a leave-in conditioner and apply vitamin e oil almond oil or avocado oil to the hair shaft. this will help keep the hair shaft soft smooth and lessen the amount of brittle dry ends on your hair. before you go to bed wrap your hair with a silk scarf. this will help hold in moisture. do not dye and perm your hair simultaneously. this combination can be very destructive to your hair shaft. if you follow these tips you will notice that there will be less split ends and breakage. therefore you will only need to trim your hair as needed. in general frequent trimming of your hair does not make your hair grow faster.	i have been wearing hair weaves for four years. now my hair touches my shoulders. how can i keep growing it out?

"toddlers can have a lot of odd behavior so i guess that hiding things could be one of them. toddlers get into all types of mischief since they readily explore their expanding environment. they think nothing of taking a steak knife out of the dishwasher and run down the hall with it. when they are caught and disarmed they will collapse to the floor in a tantrum because you took their knife. possession is important to toddlers so they may hide things so they can keep it for themselves. it is not unusual for them to take car keys and throw them behind the couch or worse flush them down the toilet. correct the toddler gently but firmly. tell them about ""your"" things and his/her things. focus on the behavior but not the child. for instance ""hiding mommy's keys was a bad thing. good boys (or girls) do not do these things and you are a good boy (or girl)"". these odd behaviors tend to be very temporary so hang in there."	is it normal for a toddler to hide things

the most commonly used fillers are made out of hyaluronic acid. because of their varying consistency they are used differently. prevelle silk is the thinnest of the hyaluronic acid fillers. it gives a soft subtle effect that is very natural. it’s my personal favorite for treating the area around the lips. the effects usually last 3 to 4months. juvederm is slightly thicker. it works well on marionette lines that just beginning to show smile lines and to smooth the contours of jaws that are beginning to sag. juvederm usually lasts around 6-8 months although in the lips it does not last as long because the constant movement of the mouth breaks down the filler. restylane is one of the older fillers around. while many doctors still use it i personally prefer to use juvederm or perlane because i find they give smoother results. perlane is the thickest of the hyaluronic acid fillers. it’s best for deep folds like really pronounced marionette lines or the creases that run down from the nose and around the mouth. this is the one people start asking for once they hit forty. it lasts for about a year. perlane does tend to leave the skin slightly swollen for a couple of days so plan accordingly ifyou have a big event coming up. radiesse is a totally different filler. in the first place it’s made out of calcium. it has a firmer consistency which makes it ideal to model cheekbones or jawlines or to fill in very deep marionette lines. the problem some doctors have with radiesse is that because it takes so long to dissolve – up to a year in most cases – it’s very hard to correct mistakes. unsatisfactory radiesse results however are there to stay for the next 12 months.	which cosmetic filler is best for me?

i clearly understand your symptoms. the basic reason behind the whole issue is the autonomic imbalance which your nervous system shows to specific sensory inputs. let me simplify that thing for you. all the senses give input to our brain like smell vision taste hearing and touch. out of these five the first two can have relatively major influence on our autonomic nervous system. the autonomic nervous system is the part of nervous system which regulates blood circulation digestion respiration cardiac rhythm etc. the alteration of blood flow in the brain produces those flashes of light and sometimes a lost patch of vision in a field. now people with migraine have little problem with these autonomic regulations and that is what is happening to you. the new smell is excessively disturbing your autonomic nervous system and so you have all the symptoms which you described. the olfactory system gets adapted relatively quickly. so if you continue to go there eventually you will get adopted. if that does not happen then you can use mechanical barriers such as a small mask to avoid the smell up to a certain extent but it may not help much. for nausea i suggest emefilm (ondansetron) 8 mg a thin mouth dissolving film of medicine to be kept below the tongue when you feel nauseated and topiramate 50 mg twice a day for headache. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. for further information consult a neurologist online --><link>	Hi doctor,My company is putting down new carpeting.

fluconazole (diflucan) at a single low dose is pregnancy class c which means risk to the developing baby cannot be ruled out. in studies on animals and people when pregnant mothers took fluconazole in high doses (400 mg/day) for weeks or months birth defects in the newborn children and animals were sometimes seen. at these doses fluconazole is considered pregnancy class d – meaning it should absolutely not be taken by a mom-to-be. fluconazole is most often taken in a single smaller dose (150 mg once) as treatment for a vaginal yeast infection. there does not seem to be a significant risk to the developing baby from such a low dose of fluconazole. talking with your ob/gyn doctor is the best way to decide if fluconazole is safe for you and your baby.	is it safe to take diflucan during pregnancy? . fluconazole (diflucan) at a single low dose is pregnancy class c which means risk to the developing baby cannot be ruled out.

hyperpigmentation discoloration or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (pih) on your skin can be attributed to a variety of disorders. i like to begin with excluding any medical reasons that may result in hyperpigmentation. hyperpigmentation may be attributed to renal disease diabetes or peripheral vascular disease. pih arises from an acquired excess of pigment related to an inflammatory process such as infection an allergic reaction a reaction to medication or a trauma. pih often occurs as a consequence of inflammatory skin disorders including acne drug-induced eruptions and eczema. once you have excluded medical causes there are multiple options to regain your even skin tone. a combination of glycolic acid aha and tretinoin-based products -- along with a traditional topical skin care regimen -- will work for skin brightening. hydroquinone-based products work well. however there are other alternatives such as bearberry kojic acid licorice extract and niacin. these compounds will work towards brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone. the key is to work with a physician that is very familiar with your skin type and color because incorrect use of these agents can lead to further hypo- or hyperpigmentation. i tell my african-american patients in particular that in order to get your skin in shape it has to be a gradual process similar to exercising. you would not attempt to lift 250 lbs on the first day of your workout; this attempt may lead to injuring yourself and disastrous results. the same holds true with your skin regimen a gradual approach is always best. once you get your melanocytes in shape and under control you can improve your skin tone.	what can i do about the dark circles under my eyes?

under federal law known as hipaa (health insurance portability and accountability act) you have the right to access records documenting your health conditions diagnoses and treatments. put your request in writing and send it to the doctor's office. there are state laws that dictate the timelines within which they must send you your records (be aware that you may have to pay for the cost of copying the records). sometimes consumers face trouble getting a hold of their records despite their right to them. i hope you that won't be the case for you. if you do face any barriers however i'll point you toward a previous blog i wrote on the topic which offers information and resources.	how can i formally request my medical records from my old doctor to my new doctor? . my insurance changed which does not list my former doctor as a network provider. i chose a new doctor and i feel he should now have my medical records.
"when you swallow a muscular valve known as the lower esophageal sphincter or les which is located where the esophagus joins the stomach opens to let food into your stomach and then closes to keep your stomach contents from coming back up. the major cause of gerd is that this valve that does not function the way it should -- either because it is weak or because it relaxes inappropriately. a hiatal hernia (in which a portion of the stomach protrudes above the diaphragm into the chest) and poor esophageal muscle contractions also contribute to gerd. diet and lifestyle also play a role. fatty foods mints chocolate alcohol coffee and tea all relax the les. so does nicotine from cigarettes or chewing tobacco. hormonal changes associated with pregnancy can temporarily weaken the les too. obesity can lead to gerd because the pressure of extra weight pushing on your abdomen may ""overpower"" the les allowing reflux to occur. the same mechanism explains reflux that may occur when you bend over at the waist."	what causes gerd?
stay on those antibiotics and keep using the nasonex. hot or warm facial compresses (20 minutes at a time) can help as well as staying very well hydrated. no one really wants sinus surgery but sometimes that is the only or last resort. hang in there your doctor is doing the best that he can to avoid the operating room by keeping on you an extended course of antibiotics. your situation has probably cleared up by now but i still had to respond because i had the exact same problem a few years ago. i was in the exact same situation. i was taking antibiotics nose spray oral steroids and everything else the doctor could prescribe. one day i read about something called a nedi pot and decided to try it. nothing else worked so i figured why not. there are a few different types and i used the type designed where you put the solution in the container put the tip of the container in one side of your nose lean over a sink and squeeze until the solution comes out the other nostril. then you repeat switching sides. it's a little different design than the traditional nedi pot but i thought it might work better. unfortunately nothing much more than the solution came out. but then about 10 minutes later my left nostril started dripping out a little of the solution (which is not uncommon according to the directions in the kit). so i leaned over the sink held closed my right nostril and blew out threw my left nostril expecting just some remaining solution to come out. a few drops of solution did come out but then all of the sudden to my surprise a massive clump of very thick dark green mucus dropped out of my nostril. i was shocked and amazed. i had never seen anything like it before. and the pain and pressure on the left side of my face was immediately gone. the mucus that was stuck in my front sinus cavity was so thick that the only thing that could get down to it and jar it loose was the warm saline solution that i flushed through my nose and sinuses with the sinus flush kit. and the solution that comes with the kit is a simple all natural saline solution which is safe enough for even a child to use. so for anyone who has ever had sinus facial pain and pressure you must try this sinus flush. and i know this might sound completely disgusting but i wish i had recorded myself doing this flush so i could see it again or even just show people what happened because even to this day i am still amazed at what came out of my nose that day. and all from a kit that cost approx. $10 (i bought the generic store brand) and took about 10 minutes to cure what weeks of taking multiple prescription medications and numerous doctor visits couldn't do.	my sinus is blocked on the left side of my face. how dod i get this to drain without having surgery. ct scan shows alot of junk on the left side of my face. teeth hurt hoarse at times. been on 1 antibotic for 20 days now going on another round for 30 days along with using nasonex. what else can i do to prevent surgery.
hi i have this from the uk’s nhs its all pretty standard stuff for flying but you have that extra problem i think like they say get this all in place before you even think about booking. before you travel. if you're planning on travelling by plane you should discuss this with your midwife or gp. before you book your tickets check with your airline and insurance company that they will allow you to travel while pregnant. after week 28 of the pregnancy most airlines require a letter from your midwife or gp confirming: that you're in good health that you have a normal pregnancy the expected date of delivery be aware that your gp may charge you for the letter. your gp surgery can give you more information about what their charges are. some airlines may require medical clearance if: your delivery date is less than four weeks after your departure date or any complications are expected in your delivery. this may involve your gp or midwife filling in a form or an assessment by the airline staff. check with your airline as the restrictions can vary. do hope this helps you. good luck	can i do 7 hour flight when 30 weeks pregnant with placenta circumsvalata? . hi i am 27 years old and pregnant at 24 weeks. last week i was told that i have placenta circumsvalata based on my 22 week fetal survey. i am also planning a move from east coast to west coast. does this condition cause any concern if i fly for 7 hours when i am 30 weeks pregnant? as i read most complications from this condition start happening after then. so far i am at 24 weeks never had spotting or any other complications baby growth and kick are all normal. thanks!
you're probably fine. the oral typhoid vaccine like all vaccines works by generating an immune response by your body. the oral typhoid vaccine requires about a week (after the last dose) to be considered fully effective. because it sounds like you took the last dose only 12 hours later than scheduled you're probably fine as long as you avoid exposure to typhoid fever sources for at least a week. if you want a truly accurate answer however your best bet is to consult your primary health care provider or a pharmacist. they can tell you if you're considered vaccinated against typhoid fever or not. hope this helps!	i forgot to take my 4th typhoid vaccine pill on the scheduled day but took it the next day. do i need to start over? . all four pills were taken within 48 hours of each other even though the last one had 2 calendar days between doses. the first three i took around 6pm on the 5th 7th and 9th of the month. i took the last pill on the 12th of the month at 7am. do i need to start the sequence over or will the vaccine still be effective?

a blood pressure of 145/85 mmhg comes under grade 1 (mild) systolic and prehypertensive diastolic blood pressure. nifedipine use should be stopped as soon as possible. nifedipine can cause hypotension and results in severe tachycardia. basically you do not need any medication for blood pressure right now. your problems are because of your higher anxiety levels. i suggest you do 45 minutes of strenuous exercise daily. avoid oily and fast food. take a low salt diet and eat lots of fibers and fruits. drink plenty of water. stop all the antihypertensive medications. for your raised anxiety level i suggest you take tablet clonazepam 0. 25 mg once before sleep for 14 days. please consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take the medication with consent. do not overthink about the blood pressure. food cannot cause this problem especially if you do not have an acid peptic problem or heartburn or peptic ulcers. revert back after 10 days to a cardiologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,Last year, I joined a new organization, where the working hours are higher with both day and night shifts. Before joining the new organization, I had a stable blood pressure (less than 118/75 mmHg). About five months back, I felt feverish and visited a hospital for the same. That time, I came to know that my blood pressure had risen to 145/85 mmHg. Since then, my life has never remained the same. My parents are not hypertensive. I was having chest pain and sleeping problems from then. I was given Nifedipine for blood pressure and Lexotan for sleep. After taking these two drugs for two days my condition got worsened. I started having anxiety. I reported back to my doctor. In fact, I personally stopped using those drugs.My BP dropped to a range of 125-130/87-80 mmHg. Since I was not comfortable with the blood pressure, I bought a blood pressure monitor to check at home. I am a food technologist. So, I started working on the food I eat. But, my sleeping problem and anxiety worsened. So, I decided to take my annual leave and that was about three months back. After resting for a month, my blood pressure dropped to 110-118/75-72 mmHg. My BP dropped without any drug, only with the inclusion of fruits and vegetables in most of my meals. I resumed work around two months back. In the first week of this month, my blood pressure had started rising again. I have been looking for a new job, but you understand the economic crisis now. I feel the shift in work is not good for my system. During the morning shift, my blood pressure ranges from 140-125/85-80 mmHg. During the night shift and off days, the BP ranges between 112-119/75-78 mmHg. What could be the cause for this rise in BP? I was thinking that maybe the restaurant food I consume during the morning shift as the probable cause because during a night shift, I eat at home. I am 35 years old. My weight is 74 kg and height is 180 cm (6 feet).

"this is a very interesting question to me because i love obscure stuff. i should start by saying there often is no answer to ""why"" for many weird body occurrences. when medicine can't figure out an answer to ""why "" they call the situation ""idiopathic. "" this basically means ""of unknown origin. "" then too sometimes these weird symptoms actually are normal. in your case for instance if your toes have always itched at night then that probably is just normal for you. who knows why? maybe there's something unique about the way the nerves in your toes function. there are certain conditions that can produce the symptom you describe though. one of these is raynaud's phenomenon. in raynaud's blood flow to the fingers toes (and the extremities more generally) is disrupted by exposure to cold temperatures. the vessels go into spasm and the tissue lacks oxygen so it burns or itches or feels painful. a rather obscure symptom of raynaud's is itchy toes. of course if you don't have any other symptoms of raynaud's then it's unlikely this is the cause of your symptoms. another obscure possible cause of your symptoms is gout. usually gout presents with a complaint of sharp pain in the big toe especially at night. gout normally causes swelling too. if you don't have nighttime swelling and redness in the toe then it's unlikely gout is the source of your symptoms. i suggest you continue to monitor the situation and record your symptoms in a log book. even if you just write down the dates and times your toes itch it could be helpful to your doctor in arriving at a diagnosis -- if there is one. like i said many times we have no idea what is causing a benign symptom like itchy toes. wishing you well!"	why do just the pads of my toes itch at night? it's mostly the big toe. i have had an emg and don't have neuropathy.
ibuprofen is used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headache dental pain menstrual cramps muscle aches or arthritis. it is also used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it works by blocking your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation. this effect helps to decrease swelling pain or fever. if you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain. this form of ibuprofen is intended for use by children. do not give this medication to a child younger than 6 months unless directed by the doctor. check the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. the manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. also products with similar names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes. taking the wrong product could harm you.	what conditions does ibu-drops treat?

the perceived drawbacks of older epilepsy drugs spurred a renaissance of development of new epilepsy drugs launched in the 1990s. some of the newer ones include keppra; lamictal; zonegran; felbatol; neurontin; and trileptal. older epilepsy drugs include dilantin depakote tegretol and phenobarbital. limited studies suggest newer epilepsy drugs control seizures as well as the older medicines -- but not better. so don't count out the older drugs. in one recent high-quality study valproic acid was more effective than newcomers lamictal and topamax. valproic acid even had fewer people quit taking the drug because of side effects than did topamax. older epilepsy drugs have a longer track record and most doctors are more familiar with them. they're more widely available on drug formularies and are less expensive than newer epilepsy drugs. until clinical studies settle the issue expert groups and epilepsy advocacy organizations recommend against switching branded for generic epilepsy drugs.	which epilepsy medication is right for me?

yes. conditions like crohn's disease and colitis which cause chronic inflammation of the colon can interfere with the absorption of certain vitamins or minerals leading to deficiencies. people with chronic acid reflux who take certain acid blockers may end up with too little stomach acid. as a result their digestive tracts can't absorb certain nutrients properly possibly leading to b12 deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. an imbalance in the friendly bacteria that help break down food can cause vitamin or mineral deficiencies. chronic alcoholism may also lead to vitamin b and magnesium deficiencies. if you're worried that you may have a condition that affects your vitamin or mineral levels it's wise to talk to your doctor.	do some diseases cause vitamin or mineral deficiencies?

kindergarten is the cause of your daughter's frequent colds coupled by her questionable personal hygiene and social commitments to her many friends. the average child gets 6-9 viral infections (mostly colds) per year and most are in the winter months. when children are plunged into a new environment with new kids they get new germs. there are over 200 different viruses that cause the common cold so until she pays her dues. and gets enough colds to build her immunity she will be be catching her share (and bringing them home to her family). in most cases your daughter doesn't have a mysterious weak immune system. all she has is over-exposure to children her same age all with the same questionable hygiene. the play together. touch each other (and everything else) and they are taught to share. germs are freely shared. she will improve over time but you are going to see un upswing of illnesses after the holidays because her colleagues are traveling to different locations where they will pick up even newer and more-alien bugs and bring them back to kindergarten to share. again. hang in there. medical providers can do little to prevent cold and nothing to cure them. all we can do is treat symptoms watch for complications and wait them out.	my daughter is five and every two weeks she gets a runny nose bad cough and high fever. why is this happening? . doctors say flu allergies but never give her anything for it. she keeps getting sick we keep taking her back to doctor. this last time she went they said they thought they heard crackling in her chest. x-ray showed not enough to require medicine. shes sick for three or four more days. gets better than exactly seven days later same thing all over again. high fever bad cough runny nose. the times in between her getting sick seems to be getting shorter. doctor just sends her home. what do i do?

"when it comes to carbs we generally divide them into two groups: refined and unrefined. some people refer to these as ""bad carbs"" and ""good carbs "" respectively. in general refined carbohydrates are less valuable nutritionally than unrefined (whole) carbs. so a list of unrefined (whole) carbohydrates might include: all raw frozen or canned vegetables (though canned vegetables can contain excessive salt) all raw or frozen fruit (without added sugar) all whole grains (brown rice whole wheat pasta) all whole or canned beans be careful with potatoes. white (and red-skinned golden etc. ) potatoes can cause blood sugar to spike after eating. also be careful with so-called ""whole grain"" breads. read bread labels carefully or buy from a bakery that grinds its own grain. a simple way to evaluate bread is by its mass (weightiness) in your hand. if a bread feels heavy and dense it's probably a good whole-grain loaf. when it comes to fruits some contain more natural sugars than others. grapes are very sugary and shouldn't be a first choice for people with diabetes for example. canned fruits often contain a lot of added sugar so again read labels carefully. of course remember sugar of any kind is a carbohydrate. refined sugars including granulated (white or brown) sugar and powdered sugar is not good in excess. watch for hidden sugars in prepared foods and beverages. good for you for trying to improve your diet. eating a variety of fresh vegetables fruits and whole grains is good for your health. wishing you well! the mayo clinic website has great info and detailed food lists for diabetics etc. should be able to find what you want there also. elizabeth has given you good info. i'm a type 2 diabetic and can validate what she advises. the more ""processed"" a food item is. the worse it is for us. read the label. those ""whole grain breads"" use processed wheat (white) flour as a base with enough whole wheat flour and often molasses for coloring. luckily i was raised by my grandparents in the late 40's and 50's on a farm and learned how to eat and cook from the basics. you should learn that if you want to survive diabetes. old-fashioned rolled oats will become your best friend during a sweet attack. i've found that homemade white cornbread is relatively non-offensive (believe-it-or-not). and don't waste your money on sucralose. it doesn't sweeten diddly when cooking plain old walmart aspartame works just fine. good luck"	give me a list of grains fruits veggies beans that are rich in good carbohydrates.

the period of time between exposure to hepatitis and the onset of the illness is called the incubation period. the incubation period varies depending on the specific hepatitis virus. hepatitis a has an incubation period of about 15-45 days; hepatitis b from 45-160 days and hepatitis c from 2 weeks to 6 months. many patients infected with hepatitis a b and c have few or no symptoms of illness. for those who do develop symptoms of viral hepatitis the most common are flu-like symptoms including: loss of appetite. nausea. vomiting. fever. weakness. tiredness. aching in the abdomen. less common symptoms include: dark urine. light-colored stools. fever. jaundice (a yellow appearance to the skin and white portion of the eyes).	what are the symptoms and signs of viral hepatitis?

there are several reasons why your doctor might want you to be on bed rest. for example your doctor may recommend bed rest if you experience early contractions which could be signs of preterm labor or if you have had previous pregnancies that ended in miscarriage still birth or premature birth. if you are expecting multiples -- two or more babies -- your pregnancy may be considered high risk and your doctor will monitor you closely. if you develop any problems your doctor might place you on bed rest. following are some other reasons your doctor may advise bed rest: preeclampsia. a potentially dangerous condition characterized by high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling particularly in the legs and face. preeclampsia occurs in up to 8% of pregnancies usually during the second half of pregnancy. vaginal bleeding. a problem with several possible causes including placenta previa a complication in which the placenta grows in the lowest part of the uterus and covers all or part of the opening to the cervix; or placental abruption a complication in which the placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is ready to be born. incompetent cervix. a weak cervix that may open prematurely. cervical effacement. softening or thinning of the cervix which is one of the first signs of labor. poor fetal development. a test or procedure that indicates a medical complication.	what are some of the reasons for bed rest during pregnancy?

you can weigh yourself as often as you feel comfortable doing so. getting on the scale is a good thing! your body weight will fluctuate on a daily basis depending what is going in and out so do not become discouraged if it does not go down on a day to day basis. it is usually recommended that you weigh in once each week in order to see a more accurate weight over time. get on the scale in the mornings before eating or drinking on the same day each week. also keep a log of your weights from week to week to see your changes. if you still want to weigh in on a daily basis – take a three day average to determine a more accurate reading.	i’ve heard that i shouldn’t weigh myself every day and only once each week – what is the best way to monitor my weight?

although consuming a moderate amount of alcohol can have some potential health benefits drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. a moderate amount of alcohol consumption per day is considered 2 servings for men (under 65 years old) and 1 serving for women and men over 65 years old. a serving is considered: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine or 1. 5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits so the answer to your question depends on if you’re male or female how old you are and whether you’re having an appropriate serving size. if you’re already an alcohol drinker small amounts of alcohol may actually lower your blood pressure but this isn’t to suggest that you start drinking if you don’t already. the potential benefits of alcohol need to be weighed against the possible detrimental health effects since consuming alcohol can lead to other health problems too. this would be an area to discuss further with your doctor. drinking too much alcohol in one sitting can temporarily raise your blood pressure and drinking too much on a regular basis can cause long term blood pressure problems. keep in mind that consuming excess alcohol can also increase calorie consumption which could possibly lead to weight gain another risk factor for hypertension. it’s typically not recommended to start drinking alcohol if you don’t already and it’s important to limit alcohol consumption to moderate amounts if you already consume alcohol.	does 2 or 2 1/2 glasses of wine a day caues high blood preasure?
i'm sorry you're going through this. the symptoms you're describing could be caused by many conditions but a likely culprit is some sort of spinal issue. spinal degeneration is not uncommon as we age (though i don't know how old you are) and a ruptured disc in the neck can happen to anyone. either of these conditions can cause aching and tiredness of the limbs. i'd suggest you go back to the doctor to ask about these symptoms because it sounds like further testing might be warranted. blood work won't help diagnose a spinal injury or degenerative disc disease. i wish you all the best!	i ache all the time mostly my neck shoulders arms and hands and tired all the time. bloodwork came back good

if your doctor determines that it's not safe for you to perform high-impact weight-bearing exercises he or she may recommend low-impact weight-bearing exercises that are less likely to cause fractures and also build and maintain bone density. these include: elliptical training machines low-impact aerobics stair-step machines walking (either outside or on a treadmill machine). if you're new to exercise or haven't exercised for awhile you should aim to gradually increase your level of weight-bearing exercise to 30 minutes per day on most days of the week. although exercise can benefit almost everyone with osteoporosis it's important to remember that it's only one component of an overall treatment program. other essential lifestyle recommendations include a diet rich in calcium and vitamin d maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption. you also may require osteoporosis medications to either build or maintain bone density. by working with your doctor you can develop an osteoporosis treatment program that's right for you.	what are some low-impact weight-bearing exercises for osteoporosis?

despite its name heartburn has nothing to do with the heart. (some of the symptoms however are similar to those of a heart attack or heart disease. ) heartburn is an irritation of the esophagus that is caused by stomach acid and is a common part of pregnancy. with gravity's help a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter or les keeps stomach acid in the stomach. the les is located where the esophagus meets the stomach -- below the rib cage and slightly left of center. normally it opens to allow food into the stomach or to permit belching; then it closes again. but if the les opens too often or does not close tight enough stomach acid can reflux or seep back into the esophagus and cause a burning sensation. occasional heartburn isn't dangerous but chronic heartburn can indicate serious problems such as gastritis and can develop into gastroesophageal reflux disease or gerd. heartburn is a daily occurrence for 10% of americans and 50% of pregnant women. it's an occasional nuisance for another 30% of the population.	what is heartburn?

peyronie's disease is a condition in which a plaque or hard lump forms on the penis. the plaque may develop on the upper (more common) or lower side of the penis in the layers that contain erectile tissue. the plaque often begins as a localized area of irritation and swelling (inflammation) and can develop into a hardened scar. the scarring reduces the elasticity of the penis in the area affected. peyronie's disease can occur in a mild form that heals without treatment in six to 18 months. in these cases the problem does not progress past the inflammation phase. in severe cases the disease can be permanent. the hardened plaque reduces flexibility causing pain and forcing the penis to bend or arc during erection. in addition to the bending of the penis peyronie's disease can cause general pain as well as painful erections. it also can cause emotional distress and affect a man's desire and ability to function during sex.	what is peyronie's disease?

you need to be carefully re-examined by an ent specialist. while labyrinthitis still can be causing some of these residual symptoms there are many other ear conditions that can mimic it.	i was treated for labyrinthitis about 4 months ago. however i still have ringing in my ear and is worse when showering. the ringing is aggravated by running water if i open the tap if i lay on that side (ear) and try turning over to the other side i experience nausea and dizziness! if there is intense sunlight(heat) the ear rings more.
i was on chantix and i did not have all these symptoms but i did get sick to my stomach and had horrible nightmares and bad mood swings. i quite on day 8 of taking it and have been clean for two years. i learned that drinking milk before i went to bed would make the nightmares go away and it also helped me with the stomach pains through out the day. as for the mood swings i warned people to stay away	i started chantix a week ago and i'm expirencing some horrible side effects. my doctor isn't really helping. i'm sick to my stomach for 2-3 hrs after a half dose. i started to have pale stools and dark urine. my skin is itchy but with no visible rash. i'm hot and sweating. i've quit smoking and have not had a cigertte since yesterday. i called my doctor but they told me to stick it out for another couple of days. i'm going out of my mind with the itching and can't deal with the stomach pains. what's wrong?
first thing: get him a stool to stand on if you expect him to lift the seat and stand to pee. having a heavy toilet seat crush your penis is not a pleasant experience so he will be a bit overly-cautious for a while. as long as he is urinating okay (no blood. no difficulty staring his stream) the penis is likely fine. of course i can't see it so you need to be the judge whether he sees his medical provider or not. it could have been worse. like getting slammed in a door. toilet seats hurt but they are not that heavy. cold compresses could help but who really wants a cold weenie! in most cases just leave it alone and make sure it is healing properly.	how do you treat a toddler's bruised penis? bruised due to trauma dropping of toilet seat on it

hi from thebody. com found you this. shingles is a very painful disease caused by the same herpes virus that causes chicken pox (varicella zoster virus). like other herpes viruses the varicella-zoster virus has an initial infectious stage (chicken pox) followed by a dormant stage. then with no warning the virus becomes active again. about 20% of people who have had chicken pox will eventually develop shingles. this reactivation of the virus is most likely to occur in people with a weakened immune system. this includes people with hiv disease and anyone over 50 years old. does this help you as an answer? good luck	what is the difference between shingles and herpes the sexually trasmitted disease?

"you ask a good question. sorting out the differences between the various strains of hepatitis can be confusing. hepatitis a is not uncommon even in children. hep-a is a virus that causes inflammation of the liver. (in fact that's what ""hepatitis"" means: inflammation of the liver. the ""a"" refers to the specific cause of the inflammation. ) a key symptom of hep-a is jaundice: a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. other symptoms may include diarrhea nausea and poor appetite. the usual way you get hep-a is by eating food contaminated with the fecal material of a person who's infected. yuck right? that's one reason why it's important to wash your fruits and vegetables. however hepatitis a can be transmitted in many ways including through sex and sharing needles. hepatitis a requires no treatment because it will run its course over a few weeks or months. usually a doctor will monitor liver function for awhile to make sure the liver is healing properly. after you've had hepatitis a a blood test will show antibodies to the virus. antibodies are immune system cells that fight the virus and give you immunity that should be life-long which means if you've had hep-a once you should never get it again. however you will always test positive for it even though you're immune. people who have never had hep-a can get vaccinated against it. wishing you well!"	when you have hepatitis a as a child does it stay in you system for the rest of your life?

i am very sorry for the loss of your brother. it is understandable and commendable that you are looking for the reasons behind his untimely death. sudden unexpected death in chf patients does happen. about half of all deaths from heart disease are sudden and unexpected regardless of the underlying disease. heart enlargement due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries can predispose someone to an acute bout of chf. the heart stops pumping efficiently with fluid build-up and difficulty in breathing occurring. we usually think of congestive heart failure as a progressive disease affecting older people. but sometimes this condition can occur in younger individuals such as your brother and go undiagnosed. death in patients with chf is usually the result of heart failure ischemic (stroke-like) episodes and arrhythmias (irregular beating of the heart). perhaps you can meet with the doctor in charge of your brother’s autopsy so that they can more adequately answer your questions based upon actual case facts. you deserve to hear exactly what precipitated your brother’s death and not just have to live with a death certificate showing chf as the cause of death. i hope that this answer has been helpful and wish you peace during your period of grieving.	my younger brother age 32 died in sleep. no sign of struggle except foam like saliva. pm sugest congestive heart failure. there was no medical history of heart problem except mild hypertension. he was serving in fire service and physically active. was the death due to congestive heart failure and if so what might be the reasons?

epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells or neurons in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons glands and muscles to produce human thoughts feelings and actions. in epilepsy the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed causing strange sensations emotions and behavior or sometimes convulsions muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. during a seizure neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second much faster than normal. in some people this happens only occasionally; for others it may happen up to hundreds of times a day. more than 2 million people in the united states -- about 1 in 100 -- have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. for about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. however about 25 to 30 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. some people with mental retardation may experience seizures but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the russian writer dostoyevsky the philosopher socrates the military general napoleon and the inventor of dynamite alfred nobel who established the nobel prize. several olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. seizures sometimes do cause brain damage particularly if they are severe. however most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. any changes that do occur are usually subtle and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures. while epilepsy cannot currently be cured for some people it does eventually go away. one study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy or epilepsy with an unknown cause had a 68 to 92 percent chance of becoming seizure-free by 20 years after their diagnosis. the odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. this is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had epilepsy surgery.	what is epilepsy?

the symptoms you have mentioned here are indicating towards a migraine headache. however no diagnostic test can surely rule out a migraine. its diagnosis is mainly based on the symptoms. in a migraine there is no definite pain and pain occurs at any time. some people say that a migraine usually occurs on one side of the head and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting but this is not true in all cases. the pain can be all over the head and other symptoms might be present or absent. i suggest you try doing the following. wear sunglasses cover your head with a scarf and use an umbrella whenever you go out in the sun. before going outside always drink one glass of water it will keep you hydrated and will help you. you can take sandalwood oil and massage your scalp a night before washing your hair. avoid excessive intake of tea coffee and caffeinated drinks. some foods also increase the problem of headaches so avoid those. avoid using perfumes deodorant sprays etc. as strong smell may exaggerate the problem. avoid stress anxiety and loud noises. follow a particular sleep pattern i mean try to sleep daily around the same time. if possible try to avoid mobile television laptop etc. an hour before sleep as these emit blue light which hinders normal sleep pattern and also promotes headaches. pranayam is helpful in headaches. so if you can spare 5 to 10 minutes then practice it daily. in medications i suggest you try taking the following. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. pathyadi kwath 15 to 20 ml with an equal amount of water twice a day for six weeks. godanti bhasma 250 mg with water twice a day for four to six weeks. it is an ayurvedic painkiller. shir shuladi vajra ras two tablets twice a day with water for four to six weeks. this ayurvedic medicine is also a painkiller and is used in headaches of various etiology. if you find it tedious to take multiple medicines then you can take only one of these two painkillers or can take two of them for one month. kamdudha ras 250 mg twice a day with water for four to six weeks. it will help in cooling you down internally. take anu taila and put one drop of this oil in each nostril once a day for one month. take powder of sandalwood camphor and jatamansi and. mix all in equal amount and add water or rose water and apply this paste on the forehead while you have a headache. take one teaspoon of coriander powder and add it in one cup of water and keep it for a night. drink it early in the morning on an empty stomach. if you are taking allopathic medicine then take above medicine along with that after consulting your physician. however for a migraine there is no curative treatment. it can only be avoided with the help of medicines and lifestyle changes and sometimes the headache may not disturb you for so long and sometimes may trouble you often so follow a healthy way of life. also stop these medicines during your periods. you can start them after the period gets over. i hope you are satisfied with my answer. for further queries consult an ayurveda specialist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I get headaches, especially when I wash my hair or when I go out in the sun.

yes. go back to your doctor to have your foot checked. he or she will have to look at the foot to decide what is wrong. your foot has 26 bones. there are 5 long straight bones called metatarsals beneath the top of the foot. each of these ends in bones called phalanges which are the toes. tendons that move the toes are attached to these bones. any bruising or swelling in the foot can affect the ability to move the toes by pressing on these tendons. bruising or bleeding can also spread throughout the foot and up into the toes. possibilities include a bad bruise sprain or a small fracture that did not show up on the first x-ray. this is not unusual. your doctor will decide whether further x-rays or other testing is needed.	should i have a follow up on my foot? . i walked into my childs toy last friday. i hit it on the left middle of my foot. it instantly swelled up. i went to the er later that night. they took x-rays said there was not anything wrong. well now 5 days later all of my toes are bruised and above my toes. if i hit the side of my foot it hurts and if i walk on it too much it hurts. its still hard to bend my toes and i really don't understand what my toes have to do with that part of my foot. should i go back to the doctor?
there is really nothing over-the-counter that you can buy that will remove any existing scars that you have but you can help prevent any new scars by not squeezing or picking your acne lesions anymore. hopefully you are on an effective acne medication regime; under the care of a medical professional. if you are still getting scaring it is important for you to see a good dermatologist. once you have outgrown your acne (be patient it does happen to most of us) there are many thing that a skin specialist can do to get rid of those scars from chemical peels to dermabrasions. you can certainly arrange a professional consultation now. since i do not know if you are male or female this may not be applicable to both sexes. for women getting a make-up specialist involved can certainly help hide those scars until the time is appropriate to get them permanently removed. we all tend to be our worst critic. don't let these blemishes change who you are. when people look at you they do not look at your acne they look at your eyes. and your smile. be happy with yourself and don't let your acne define who you are.	how can i reduce the appearance of my acne scars? (i am 16 and have scarring around my chin and forehead).

medical researchers aren't sure exactly how stress increases the risk of heart disease. stress itself might be a risk factor or it could be that high levels of stress make other risk factors (such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure) worse. for example if you are under stress your blood pressure goes up you may overeat you may exercise less and you may be more likely to smoke. if stress itself is a risk factor for heart disease it could be because chronic stress exposes your body to unhealthy persistently elevated levels of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. studies also link stress to changes in the way blood clots which increases the risk of heart attack.	how does stress contribute to heart disease?

"symptoms of pneumonia caused by bacteria in otherwise healthy people younger than 65 usually come on suddenly. they often start during or after an upper respiratory infection such as influenza or a cold and may include: cough often producing mucus (sputum) from the lungs. mucus may be rusty or green or tinged with blood. fever which may be less common in older adults. shaking "" teeth -chattering"" chills (one time only or many times). fast often shallow breathing and the feeling of being short of breath. chest wall pain that is often made worse by coughing or breathing in. fast heartbeat. feeling very tired ( fatigue ) or feeling very weak (malaise). nausea and vomiting. diarrhea. symptoms of pneumonia not caused by bacteria (nonbacterial) include fever cough shortness of breath and little mucus when you cough. they may come on gradually and are often less obvious and less severe than those of bacterial pneumonia. many people don't know that they have nonbacterial pneumonia because they do not feel sick. when symptoms are mild your doctor may call your condition ""walking pneumonia. "" older adults and children older adults may have different fewer or milder symptoms such as no fever or a cough with no mucus (a dry or nonproductive cough). the major sign of pneumonia in older adults may be when there is a change in how clearly they think (confusion or delirium ) or when a lung disease they already have gets worse. in children symptoms may depend on age: in infants younger than 1 month of age symptoms may include having little or no energy (lethargy) feeding poorly grunting or having a fever. in children symptoms of pneumonia are often the same as in adults. your doctor will look for signs such as cough and a breathing rate over 60 breaths per minute. conditions that may look like pneumonia include bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and tuberculosis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."	what are the symptoms of pneumonia?

vaginal bleeding during or after sex and at no other times makes me think of trauma to the cervix or vaginal or a lack of lubrication and abrasion of this tissue. an accompanying symptom could be painful sex but this doesn't directly point to either condition. an endometrial polyp could also cause bleeding during sex. your medical history and other signs and symptoms on physical exam will help your doctor determine the cause. however other exams and tests such as an ultrasound may be needed. talk with your partner about your concerns and make an appt to see your gyn. i would talk to my gynecologist if it's that much blood. at first i was thinking lubricant or maybe mild trauma getting overly vigorous but if it's a showstopper then that's another story. then did some looking around and fibroids or polyps could be the culprit and they don't affect a pap smear. i had a polyp once and went through a d&c and never had issues again. with fibroids i hear they can come back. i also read that some of this might be hormonal and since you have had a hysterectomy this might make sense. bottom line i'd go see your gyno. hope this helps.	why do i bleed during sex? . i had a hysterectomy many years ago but have had some unexplained bleeding over the years and had an additional cervical cuterage (? ). i now start bleeding while i'm having intercourse. there's no pain but it can be a show stopper. what can be causing this and is there anyway to prevent the bleeding?
fungus of the toenail always comes from fungus of the foot unless you get it from a pedicure. so if you have a true toenail fungus and you haven't had a pedicure ever and you don't have fungus of the foot then i would definitely be hesitant about that as a diagnosis. in order to take an oral antifungal like lamisil you really should have a culture of the toenail done to make sure that the fungus does grow out in culture in a nail clipping in order to make sure you have one before you treat it because not every change in the toenail even a yellow discoloration is fungus. sometimes it can be a type of eczema or psoriasis of the nail or some other type of infection. also sometimes nail polish removers can leave a yellow discoloration of the toenail. and if you add a drop of bleach to your nail polish remover that will take that yellow discoloration away. in runners i often see toenail changes especially in that first toe or the last toe and switching shoes can help as well. so not all nail changes are fungus. you need to have a known diagnosis and then you can use either an oral or a topical. i have found that neither one alone works very well to get rid of that fungus of the nail. you really need to use both together and then use a powder in the shoe or something that's going to absorb the moisture in order to prevent it from coming back. because people who are prone to it even after you cure it or you treat it appropriately it can recur. so there is really no true cure for this it's something you have to deal with over time.	my toenails are discolored and my doctor says i have toenail fungus. will over-the-counter products fix my toenails? . i don't want to spend the money for the prescription medication lamisil if i don't have to.
you need to see a gynecologist for an examination. what you're describing could well be a sexually transmitted disease such as genital herpes. one common symptom of genital herpes is small blister-like lesions on the genitals. the pimples you're describing may or may not be herpes but only a physical examination possibly accompanied by a blood test will tell. you need to find out what's causing these pimples on your labia because they're not normal. meanwhile you need to avoid having sex because even condom use won't necessarily protect your partner if you do in fact have herpes. that's because a condom may not cover all the areas of his skin that could come into contact with yours. i hope you find out soon what is causing your symptoms and i wish you all the best!	i have pimple like spots on my labia? one popped and had a mucousy discharge any idea what this may be? . it is a burning sensation and very little itching

when someone with both copd and heart failure experiences shortness of breath identifying which condition is causing the symptoms can be difficult. most people with both copd and heart failure cannot distinguish between the symptoms of each condition. doctors cannot consistently or accurately tell the two apart either. when someone with both heart failure and copd seeks help for breathing difficulty a doctor may use various tests to gauge the activity of each condition including: physical examination: listening to the lungs and heart and looking at the veins in the neck can give a doctor reason to suspect copd or heart failure. chest x-ray: heart failure may cause fluid in the lungs to be visible on a chest x-ray; in copd the lungs are usually clear. brain natriuretic peptide (bnp): this hormone is usually elevated on blood tests in people with heart failure whether or not copd is also present. pulmonary function tests: breathing tests can be used to diagnose people with copd. echocardiogram: an ultrasound test of the heart that can evaluate the heart chambers valves and pumping strength. cardiac enzymes: this blood test can help diagnose a heart attack or excessive heart strain. some people have severe copd and only mild heart failure; others have severe heart failure and only mild copd. in these cases the more severe condition is more likely to be the cause of symptoms. in people with copd and heart failure of about equal severity doctors must make their best guess as to which condition is causing symptoms. making things even more complicated copd and heart failure can at times act up simultaneously. for example if someone has worsening heart failure symptoms that cause rapid breathing this can cause copd symptoms to worsen as well.	how can you tell the difference between copd and heart failure?

home treatment for genital herpes focuses on relieving symptoms reducing the risk of recurrent outbreaks and helping you cope with a lifelong condition. to reduce discomfort from herpes sores: take warm sitz baths or wash the area with warm water 3 or 4 times a day. in between sitz baths keep the sores clean and dry. using a hair dryer to dry off the sores may be more comfortable than using a towel. wear cotton underpants which absorb moisture better than those made from synthetic material. nonprescription medicines may reduce the pain and fever from genital herpes. to lower the risk of recurrent outbreaks reduce or avoid factors that trigger outbreaks such as overexposure to sun fatigue irritation of the genital area and stress. finding out that you have genital herpes may cause you to have negative thoughts or feelings about yourself or about sex such as: feeling ashamed or embarrassed. being afraid of the consequences of the infection. being angry at the person who infected you. feeling frustrated with treatment or recurrent outbreaks. feeling scared to have sex. a counselor or support groups for people with herpes may be helpful. for more information see the other places to get help section of this topic. genital herpes can be bothersome. but if you are a healthy adult you do not need to worry that it will cause serious problems. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what can i do to treat genital herpes at home?

palliative care and hospice care often are mentioned in the same sentence as if they are the same thing. they are not but they do share certain characteristics. hospice is care for people at the end of their lives and their families. hospice care encompasses physical emotional and spiritual support. it is not offered only to the dying person but to the entire family as well. hospice care is not about prolonging life; it is about providing comfort care and measures designed to enhance the dying person's quality of life. and this is the point where hospice and palliative care overlap. palliative care too is about maximizing a person's quality of life. however palliative care is not just for patients with limited life expectancy. any person with a serious illness or chronic medical condition may benefit from palliative care. palliative care takes a holistic approach to addressing pain--physical and/or emotional--and other issues of comfort. for example a palliative physician might order special skin creams to minimize the pain and tissue irritation from radiation therapy for cancer. palliative team members may include specially trained physicians nurses psychotherapists social workers physical therapist occupational therapists nursing assistants and others. this team focuses treatment on the patient but also offers support to family members. i hope this helps!	compare palliative with hospice care

"the birth control pill alone offers you excellent protection against an unintentional pregnancy but offers you no protection against sexually-transmitted disease. even the most honest and trustworthy males can have an undisclosed sexual transgression with another person exposing them to an std. this std can spread to you. temporary break-ups arguments and a dozen other reasons may give a boy the implied permission to have sex with someone else. they may only disclose this transgression after you are diagnosed with an std. humans tend to lie about these things. i don't know you. or your boyfriend but in order to protect yourself from a possible std. no matter how unlikely this may be. insist on him using a condom for your protection. the added contraceptive value is another plus since no contraceptive method is 100%. given the non-negotiable choice of ""no sex"" or ""sex only with a condom"" a male partner will use a condom. recreational sex is your personal choice but an std or unintentional pregnancy is always a possibility."	is it okay to have sex on the pill and him finish without protection? . i am on lo loestrin fe. i have been on this pill for about 4-5 months now. i got on it to help with my menstrual cycle. a few months ago i started having sex with my boyfriend (of almost 2 years). we have used a condom for extra protection but a few times haven't used anything and he finished. i take my birth control at the same time every night the latest i may take it is maybe an hour or an hour and a half off (but not often at all). are we not being smart about this?
"there's no good answer to your question because it's a bit subjective. both oral percocet (oxycodone-apap) and demerol (meperidine) are narcotic pain relievers. because each person's body responds differently to different substances one person may feel oxycodone is more effective than meperidine (or the other way around). in this case that person may describe oxycodone as ""stronger"" than meperidine. however it's not a matter really of one being stronger than the other. it's a matter of which works best to control pain in any given individual. i hope there wasn't a bet riding on this! take care!"	what medication is stronger dermorol or percocet?

most helpful answer so sorry to hear you're dealing with this. pain is never fun! the symptoms you're describing could be caused by several things ranging from injury (striking your hand against an object for example) to repetitive motion strain (such as from using a video game controller for hours on end). treating the symptoms may be based in part on what is causing them so your best bet is to get checked out by your primary care provider. he or she will evaluate the problem possibly order some tests (x-ray for example) and then develop an appropriate treatment plan for you. so while this certainly isn't an emergency situation it would be a good idea to have this problem checked out before it gets any worse. good luck to you!	i have pain at the base of my thumb by the wrist. chronic pain weakness tenderness to touch

without the ability to examine you and take an extensive medical history it would be impossible for me or any medical provider to blindly offer you a patient-specific explanation. my immediate advice to you is to lay off masturbation for about 3-4 days and then see what happens. frequent ejaculations can decrease seminal volume significantly so give it rest for a few days. i suspect things will return to normal.	im 14 i could produce sperm but now it woun't come out im scarred could it get answered quickly please im 14 yrs old btw. what happening

it is normal to have some morning accumulation of fluid or mucous-like substance in the corners of the eye. thinner drainage like tears will drain down the nasolacrimal duct into your nose and not be noticed. the thicker material just can make it through this tiny drainage tube. the eye is always secreting tears and lubrication (from oil-like glands under the eyelid) so this is not really alarming. true pink eye (conjunctivitis) is typically painful and the drainage is copious all day long. allergic conjunctivitis tends to itch and last a long long time. making a self-diagnosis can be difficult so if you are concerned then you can address this problem with your medical provider or even optometrist.	pinkeye. concerning the discharge. i have only the occasional 'crust' from sleeping but do have what appear to be 'strings' of a mucus like substance that forms in my lower eyelid. i frequently just touch it and pull it out. its white in color and seems to not want to go away. i had thought maybe it was from an allergen but i dont have allergies to speak of nor is this a seasonal thing. is this something i should be concerned about?

inflammation of the colon causes the muscle layers to go into intermittent spasm and cause cramp-like pain which is pain that comes and goes. the pain usually is in the lower abdomen. since the muscles fail to contract in a normal pattern and the colonic contents move through the colon rapidly there is little opportunity for water to be reabsorbed. this leads to watery diarrhea. if the lining of the colon is inflamed and breaks down bleeding may occur. with colitis particularly colitis involving the distal colon (rectum and sigmoid colon) the pain often crescendos and precedes a diarrheal bowel movement. after the bowel movement the pain may relent but then returns with the next episode. depending upon the cause of the colitis fever and possibly malaise may be present.	what are the symptoms of colitis?

that income level will qualify you for medicaid. however if your state is not expanding medicaid you may not be able to get financial help. the reason is the aca was written with the assumption that all states would expand their medicaid program. after the supreme court's ruling last summer states were given flexibility to do so and about half have chosen not to. the law was not written to include subsidies for people it initially intended to be covered by medicaid.	why is there currently no financial help when buying health insurance for a single person that makes less than $11 490? . does that mean no tax help as well?
plantar fasciitis which is inflammation of foot tissue can be reduced by decrease weight bearing by wearing different footwear and by physiotherapy. tens (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) will not be an effective one. you need to take ultrasound therapy with analgesic cream use and it will be more effective. tens therapy is only temporary and will not give a problem solving approach. even though it will not give any side effect there will not be a benefit too. so kindly take ultrasound therapy which is essentially needed for 15 days and the protocol is 1 mhz and 1. 5 w/sq cm for 10 minutes daily. for further information consult a physiotherapist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My mother, who is 50, is suffering from plantar fasciitis.

unfortunately you can. genital herpes can end up on your mouth through oral sex for instance. and it is possible for this to happen even when you do not have active lesions. this is the chance that you will both need to take if this was your underlying concern. you have most likely seen many people with cold sores/or fever blisters. these are typically type 1 herpes lesions but you can get type 2 lesions (genital types) on your mouth. with that said you are both actively producing antibodies to suppress the genital outbreaks. theoretically this should limit the spread to other areas but not totally eliminate the possibility. the fact that you both have herpes not at least solves part of the problem. if one of you has active lesions i am sure that sexual activity would not be high on your to-do list at least until you are better. are you both taking suppression drugs? these are daily anti-herpes medicines you can take to limit recurrent outbreaks.	herpes transmission somewhat complicated question. i have genital herpes but no outbreaks after the initial one. my partner got it from me and has genital outbreaks. we're wondering if we're able to spread it to each other in areas where we haven't had outbreaks during shedding (not active outbreak). seems obvious that we could spread it around while there are lesions so we're careful during her outbreaks. but the big mystery is . can we spread it to new areas during shedding. . ? . thanks a million. we've been searching hard for the answer. .

because benefits and cost-sharing arrangements vary greatly from one plan to another the only way for you to find out how much the surgery will cost is to first check with your insurer. you want to confirm that the surgery is a covered service and then what your plan dictates you pay -- a flat rate co-pay co-insurance do you have a deductible to meet? and keep in mind that if you see an in-network provider the cost of the surgery will no doubt be less expensive. to get a good idea of what the overall cost of surgery should be visit fairhealthconsumer. org. you'll be prompted to enter the procedure you need and your zip code and you'll be shown an average price for the service in your area.	how much would it cost for me to get ingrown toenails removed from both big toes if i have anthem blue cross insurance? . i went to the urgent care and they couldn't do the surgery there but the put me on antibiotics for the infection and the urgent care doctor said i need to follow up with a podiatrist. my question is how much will that cost with anthem blue cross insurance?

"i'm not sure exactly what you're asking but as i've worked with transgender patients in the past i'll try to answer your question. if you're talking about physical transgender issues such as wanting to have your breasts removed (or have breast augmentation to create breasts) then the correct expert to see is a plastic surgeon. you may want to ask around within the transgender community for referrals to surgeons in your area who have experience working with transgender patients. if you're talking about complete sexual reassignment surgery (also called sex change surgery) it's a little more difficult. there are only a few surgeons who perform these surgeries. if you're talking about the emotional issues that can come with being transgender then i'd suggest you seek out a psychotherapist who has experience working with transgender clients. again if you're ""out"" within the transgender community you might ask around for recommendations from other transgender individuals. i hope this helps and i wish you all the best!"	what expert that help transgender issues

i guess the only thing predictable about tinnitus is it's unpredictability. i have tinnitus as well. about 15 years now and it started (most likely) from viral infection in the inner ear. acoustic damage is just one of the ways so yours may have been viral as well. i can offer no explanation as to why your tinnitus switched ears. i can't say that i have seen this in clinical practice so this is a unique experience. remember that tinnitus is usually not a real noise by an illusion of a noise that our brain creates. i can't comment on your brain tumor concern but fortunately for all of us tumors are a very rare cause. if you are going to see a doctor see a neurotologist (an ent/neurologist).	i've had tinnitus for 12 years in my left ear. suddenly i have tinnitus in my right ear and my left ear is fine. how? . i went to doctors got hearing tests got mri's etc. the doctors said it was just inner ear damage (even though i listened to music at a low volume and had never been to a concert). after 12 years suddenly my other ear is ringing and my left ear is fine (i tested this by making soft noises on my left side that i hadn't been able to hear). i am confused about how suddenly my ears decided to trade tinnitus. does this mean i have brain tumor after all? . and yes i know i should see a doctor.

theoretically you can transfer a type one herpes virus (the cold sore) to your own genitals during the first (primary) infection when the viral shedding was very high and your immune system was very vulnerable but. that is not very likely. i have to say that the way you probably got genital herpes the old fashioned way: through sexual contact. auto-innoculation (giving it to yourself) is something that is biologically possible but extremely rare. i have never seen it. some people with herpes are surprisingly oblivious. i have conclusively diagnosed many people with herpes who thought they just had a rash or a sore area from the rubbing of clothing. it is even possible and scientifically proven that herpes can be transmitted even when the partner does not have an active or obvious outbreak. most of the people who get herpes were not aware that they were exposed since their partner -- sometimes their only partner did not have a clue they had it. will you have it for life? yes unfortunately but the number of outbreaks could be quite infrequent (or not). the body's immune systems usually does a great job keeping herpes at bay. you should inform any partner that you have it regardless. there are some good antiviral drugs if taken regularly that can reduce the outbreak incidences and the amount of viral shedding that could affect others. talk to your medical provider about it.	i think i got genital herpes from my own cold sore. will it ever go away or am i stuck with it for life?
infection usually is spread by fecal-oral contamination although occasionally the virus is spread by droplets expelled by infected individuals. items like utensils diaper-changing tables and toys that come in contact with body fluids that contain the virus may also transmit them to other individuals. although people of any age can get infected the majority of patients identified with coxsackie infection are children. pregnant women can pass coxsackie virus to their newborns which may cause serious problems for the newborn so pregnant women need to notify their obstetrician if they exhibit symptoms of the infection especially if they are near their delivery date. risk factors for coxsackie virus infection include physical contact with any patient with individuals with hfmd symptoms. infectious virus can be found in feces saliva fluid in blisters and nasal secretions. even patients who have recovered and have no symptoms may still shed infectious virus for weeks.	how do people get infected with coxsackie virus and what are the risk factors?

hi and from newkidscentre. com from week 7 to 14. during this time the placenta will also start to produce progesterone and will start to replace the ovaries as the main source of progesterone. this will cause the progesterone levels in the body to plateau though they will start to rise again at the end of the first trimester. it is common to see progesterone levels around 15-60ng/ml but those experiencing a multiple pregnancy will have higher levels. the body will use this hormone to relax the muscles so your body can manage your growing baby more easily. this will also help to prevent contractions too early in your pregnancy. very high levels of progesterone might cause hemorrhoids indigestion heartburn or constipation. furthermore progesterone in different trimesters can vary from at a range of as follows: first t rimester : 9-47ng/ml second trimester : 17-147 ng/ml third t rimester : 55-200 ng/ml so your about 2 points off i don't think its that much to worry over but a test next week may show a new higher reading just where you want it tom be. hope this helps you. good luck	help! progesterone level 12. 95 in 7 weeks pregnancy. i am on week 7 of pregnancy. in recent blood work my progesterone level is 12. 95 and i am on medication for that. my doctor feels that this level is low. did anyone have this similar situation and carry on to have successful pregnancy? because i am really scared.

here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting stds: consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent stds. use a latex condom every time you have sex particularly if you have more than one sex partner. (if you use a lubricant make sure it is water-based. ) limit your number of sexual partners. the more partners you have the more likely you are to catch a std. practice monogamy. this means having sex with only one person. that person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk. choose your sex partners with care. don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have a std or who has many sexual partners. get checked for stds. don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. just because you've been screened for stds early on in your pregnancy does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. if you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last std screen you need another set of screening tests. also you should be concerned if your partner may be having unprotected sex with other people. don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. you may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. plus alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby. know the signs and symptoms of stds. look for them in yourself and your sex partners. learn about stds. the more you know about stds the better you can protect yourself.	how can i protect myself against sexually transmitted diseases (stds) during pregnancy?
you need to train yourself to come more slowly. the way you can achieve that is to learn through either her masturbating you or having intercourse with you until you are close then stopping completely and then resuming when the urge to ejaculate has passed. this takes time and practice but that's not so bad right? in the meanwhile you need to be certain your partner is sexually satisfied in some way so i hope you are either masturbating her to orgasm or giving her oral sex to orgasm. i think if she feels sexually satisfied by you she will continue to work with you on this issue. .	could my daily masturbatoin be contributing to my premature ejaculation?

"the short answer is: yes it can. warfarin is generally called a ""blood thinner. "" the drug works by interrupting the production of blood clotting components that depend on vitamin k. in other words warfarin makes it difficult for your blood to clot. this is why people who take warfarin are routinely warned to be careful shaving or performing other activities in which they may cut themselves. even a small wound can bleed a lot when a person is on warfarin. warfarin is normally prescribed to people who have experienced excessive clotting (like a deep vein thrombosis or dvt ) or who have certain heart conditions that may increase the chance of a clot occurring (such as atrial fibrillation or 'a-fib '). however warfarin also may be prescribed on a short- or long-term basis for a host of other medical issues such as reducing the risk of a dvt after joint replacement surgery. a person who abruptly stops taking warfarin is at a higher risk for stroke because the blood regains its ability to clot. stroke in the brain can be caused when a clot blocks an artery carrying vital oxygen to brain tissues. if the brain tissue is deprived of oxygen in this way the tissue will die. if you have been prescribed warfarin and are unsure why you are taking or whether you need to continue taking it please consult your doctor. do not stop taking warfarin without advice from your physician as it could be very harmful to your health. wishing you well!"	can stopping warfarin cause a stroke?

"most helpful answer yes something is clearly wrong with your mother and you are very sweet to be concerned. unfortunately it would not be possible to diagnose your mother let along treat her over the internet in this forum. your mother will need to find another medical provider to exam her -- one that does not think that her symptoms are ""weird'. please encourage her to do so. there are sooooo many different reasons to account for her symptoms that it would be impossible to blindly solve it with a simple posting. she will most likely need some diagnostic tests so if this involves travelling to find a new medical provider or to have her seen at a larger medical facility this is something you may need to do."

if you have isolated the underarm rash to the deodorant then you may have your culprit. hydrocortisone 1% used three times per day would be the recommended treatment for contact dermatitis but it is not a cure-all. sometimes your medical provider will need to prescribed a topical steroid that is stronger.	i have noticed a rash under my arm it is not responding to hydrocortisone cream like it has in the past what should i do. it may have started when i began using a new deodorant however i quit using it when i noticed the rash two weeks ago i have put hydrocortisone cream on it every night and it sort of seemed like it would go away but it has not yet.
there actually are a few recommendations that could be used for a nasal decongestant in a pregnant woman who has a stuffy nose. saline solutions are fine to use. they come in a variety of forms including a nasal gel that they could apply inside their nose. it will help loosen up the mucous and therefore it's easier to breathe. also doing things like running a vaporizer or humidifier during the day humidifier is fine at night a vaporizer has a medicine cup in it you can put in things like vicks vaposteam inside of it. it will create this nice menthol air and that actually will help you breathe a little better at night. you could use a little bit of vicks vaporub rubbed on the chest. it's okay to use and that will also create that vapor effect. but other than that those are pretty much the choices. we just don't have enough data yet available on other decongestants that you would take by mouth to make sure that they are safe to both the mom and the baby. but if you have any questions come and ask the pharmacists or the medication experts.	i am pregnant and have been told that sudafed is not safe for me to take now. any recommendations?
most patients think that they sign up for psychotherapy and they go in and talk in order to “vent” their feelings. others think they are going it to see a counselor (like a lawyer or financial advisor) who will tell them what to do and how to behave. some of this is true. venting your feelings or “getting it all out” in a safe environment may be helpful in cases of grief where a loved one has died but i have also met patients who have had therapists where they have been venting every week for seven years… and they still aren’t better. so venting is part of the process in some cases. some therapists will tell you what to do and how to behave but this may not be a hallmark of a good therapist. good therapists work with you in hopes that you see better ways to behave interact and function and act on those in your own way. below are some concepts that govern certain types of psychotherapy. yes just like there are several types of medications that work in several different ways there are different types and styles of psychotherapy: analytical or psychodynamic therapy suggests that your past (your parents your upbringing your environment your friends and all of the good and bad things that ever happened to you) shapes who you are and dictates how you behave in the present. if you learn about yourself and your past then gain insight into your patterns and behaviors you can learn to react differently in the future and your symptoms will gradually improve. cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (cbt) suggests that patients have developed automatic negative and self-defeating thoughts. cbtdoes not care if problems came from your parents or elsewhere but cares that in the ‘here and now’ that you are suffering as your automatic thoughts (for example: i always fail i am never any good everyone always abandons me) trigger negative emotions (sadness anger despondency) which you get stuck in and become depressed or anxious. cbt therapists teach skills and resiliency in regards to fighting through and counteracting these negative automatic thoughts. there are likely 20 other forms of psychotherapy each with their own underlying theory and process of reducing psychiatric symptoms.	how does psychotherapy work? is it more than just about venting your feelings?

"there's really not much point in washing your face before exercise. you need to cleanse your skin after exercising and sweating in order to make sure you don't develop blocked pores or possible fungal infections of the skin. interestingly it's equally important to thoroughly dry your skin after exercising. fungal infections such as "" jock itch "" can arise if the skin stays damp. so be sure to towel off thoroughly and perhaps apply powder if you can't get completely dry. ps: women can get ""jock itch "" too. hope this helps!"	is it better to wash your face before you exercise and sweat?

females in general are not afraid of intercourse or you wouldn't be here. it is normal to be reluctant or concerned about sexual intimacy especially for the first time. hi this could be from a lack of sexual education for one a dominating mother telling you that you must not have sex because it's dirty and you should not touch a mans penis or religious upbringing that says sex is bad before marriage if things like this get indoctrinated in to a girls brain then she will never have sex. its these kind of things that need to be broken when this can be done then and only then can or could she or you enjoy a fruitful sex life either before or after marriage. for any good answers on sex have a good look at dodson and ross on there its like all the sex answers to the questions you were afraid to ask. hope this helps you. good luck	why are females afraid of intercourse? . female afraid of getting married because of intercourese? without any previous experience?

most home pregnancy tests are pretty reliable when used exactly as directed about a week after your missed period. so for example if your period was supposed to start 12/5 then you can start testing around 12/7. home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) in the urine. because the sensitivity of each brand of home pregnancy test varies you'll probably get the most accurate result if you take the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. be sure to read the instructions very carefully and time the test exactly as indicated. this will help provide the most accurate result. if you get a negative result but don't start your period i'd suggest you test again. the body continues to produce hcg throughout the first few weeks of pregnancy so a negative test could simply indicate your levels were too low to detect the first time. good luck!	the first day of my last period was 11/1/12 when can i take a home pregnancy test? . my cycles are usually 33-34 days.

i have read through your complaint and the relevant details. the bone exposure is a common thing after extraction of teeth. but as far as there is no pain you need not worry about it. may be the extraction was a bit difficult on the lower left wisdom tooth and the gums are healing slowly. please do not disturb the healing process by touching the socket with the tongue often. this might delay healing even further. also do not aggressively brush or rub salt over that area. sutures are not indicated during the healing process. if at all it is considered it should have been put immediately after the extraction. keep observing the region for another week and if not healed or becomes painful then you go to the dentist for application of a healing paste. meanwhile maintain good oral hygiene and gargle lukewarm salt water twice daily. this will flush out the debris locked in the socket and promote healing. thank you. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,A week ago, I had all of my wisdom teeth removed.

difficult as it may be i would try to take a deep breath -- and -- i would definitely not pursue any surgery at this stage. if you want to explore medical causes i would strongly encourage you to go to a pediatric endocrinolgist for evaluation. in addition to doing some blood work for hormone levels he or she may also order some straight-forward genetic tests. hopefully you have this type of specialist nearby; if not i would suggest you make arrangements to see one in a neighboring city. if you cannot do this immediately you could also get another opinion from a different general pediatrician. but i woud still push for the sub-specialty consultation.	my 3 year old daughter was a micro-preemie. her health is perfect but her clitoris is abnormally large. what can we do? . should we have corrective surgery performed or is there specialist who can offer us some guidance?

hi. surgery can help in reducing thyroid levels but it should be taken care that there is not drastic fall in the thyroid levels. so post surgery regular monitoring is a must. but if non surgical treatment that is through medications controls the levels then you can continue with the same. opt for surgery only under an expert surgeon. hope this information helps.

it's wholly possible that this is related to you stopping the abilify especially since you seem to have been fine when on both. it's also possible that your depression/bipolar disorder has simply gotten worse but i think that would be rather unlikely since your sleeping habits are unchanged. as for how long the attacks last it is not unheard of for them to last from a few minutes to upwards of a few hours - it depends on what triggers them how severe the attack is and your individual reaction to them (i can attest from personal experience from seeing a friend and having one myself). there are the traditional things you can do for yourself to make the attacks more manageable (avoiding triggers being properly rested breathing exercises etc. ) and if that doesn't help maybe your doctor could recommend new medications such as a generic less expensive form of abilify (if there is one).	how long can panic and anxiety attacks last if not medicated. i have been bipolar and have anxiety and depression issues for years. and a few months ago i had to quite taking my abilify cause i couldn't afford it so im just taking effexor instead of both. ive had a lot of stress lately and bad attacks. but when i was on both meds i was fine. my attacks can last for a few hours. i go to sleep fine and wake up fine then im back to havimg these attacks. could it because im not taking both meds together anymore? .

there is no correlation between contrast allergies and shellfish allergies. this is a myth that has persisted in the medical field since the 70's but is untrue. shellfish allergies are caused by a muscle protien in the shellfish (tropomyosin). you can't be allergic to iodine. it is in your body in your thyroid gland breast tissue and many other places. without iodine in your body you can not live.	no allergy to shellfish. ct scan w/contrast-mild reaction of hives. would there be allergic reaction to shell fish now?
"well that's an excellent question and i can understand your hesitancy. your fbs (fasting blood sugar) is only slightly high (normal is 70-100). your post-prandial (pp or ""after-dinner"") sugar is on the low side for a post-meal reading but overall it's within a normal range. (usually pp blood sugar levels go up not down. ) the question is: are these normal readings the result of a medication regimen? let me use a different example. a person has high blood pressure. they begin taking blood pressure medication and monitoring their blood pressure at home. they notice their blood pressure is always within the normal range. does this mean they should stop taking their blood pressure medication? no! the results show the blood pressure medication is working just the way it should. however it's a little trickier when you're talking about blood sugar. insulin levels that are too low can be just as dangerous as levels that are too high. you mention being in the last trimester of pregnancy. i'm wondering if your ob-gyn is concerned about gestational diabetes. i suggest you check with whoever told you to take the glyburide for a detailed explanation about why ""they"" want you to take it. you deserve to know and they should have made it clear to you when you got the prescription. wishing you well!"	fbs is 109 2hr pp is 88-104 they want me to take glyberide 2. 5 at hs. is this safe? . last trimester edc 4/2<negative_smiley>14.

ok. there are a number of different factors that play into whether this prostate cancer is going to be significant. obviously we want to know the volume of the cancer. is there a lot there? obviously the more there is the worse it is. and we want to know the grain how aggressive it is. is this like a little puppy or is it like a doberman with rabies? the more aggressive the cancer the worse the prognosis. the more likely you’ll need aggressive therapy. and the larger volume also has a role. and we also do studies to evaluate has it spread is it just in one little area or has it spread. so that’s the two factors that we look at in determining how aggressive this cancer will or will not be for you. then we have to look at the factors that relate to you. what’s your health what’s your age how old were your parents when they died if not? if your father died at age 50 and you’re 47 then -- sl: ok. we’ll go back to that. so um if your father is 50 years old when he died and you’re 47 then we may not be as aggressive with higher-risk treatments. if on the other hand you’re 57 and your father is 94 and still active vibrant healthy then we need to consider that you probably have 40 years ahead of you and we’ll be more aggressive. we also need to look at your health. if you have any heart disease blood vessel disease diabetes if you’re out climbing mountains and hiking the grand canyon and you’re 63 then we’re going to want to be more aggressive as well. so all of those factors go into determining the nature of what the threat is because we never want the treatment worse than the disease. we know that for the majority of men prostate cancer will not kill them so we want to customize treatment. if you’re young and healthy we may be more aggressive. if you’re old and have health problems we probably will not.	how will my doctor determine the best treatment for my prostate cancer?

the two most common causes of perineal or genital numbness is compression of the nerves in your spine (called as cauda equina) or compression of the nerves in the perineum itself. only sensory loss is uncommon but still possible in cauda equina syndrome (ces) since it is more commonly associated with other symptoms. compression of nerve in the perineum typically occurs in cyclists. i will suggest you to go to the closest er (emergency room) urgently. you need to be evaluated to reach the correct diagnosis. they may also order an mri for you to identify the exact site of nerve compression since the treatment varies as per the site of compression. delay in treatment may make the symptoms irreversible. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I have been riding my bike a lot more recently and now I noticed that I am having numbness within the perineal region including scrotum and penile area.

most helpful answer hsv-2 or herpes simplex virus-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes. genital herpes is a very common sexually transmitted disease. according to the cdc it affects about one in every 6 people in the united states between the ages of 14 and 49. many family doctors are comfortable treating hsv-2. women may also seek help from their gynecologist or a dermatologist. men may want to consult a urologist or a dermatologist for help in managing this condition. you can get a lot more information from the webmd genital herpes heath center <link> it is surprising that your doctor is unfamiliar with hsv-2 because genital herpes is very common. one out of five woman between the ages of 14 and 49 has genital herpes. men are less likely to be affected (1 out of 9) because the virus is more easily transmitted to a female during sex with an infected male. gynecologists are the appropriate doctors to treat genital herpes for a woman. for both sexes std (sexually transmitted disease) clinics are appropriate. for a man a urologist a dermatologist or an infectious disease doctor would be the appropriate choice to help you with your treatment plan. although there is no cure for herpes treatments can relieve the symptoms. medication can decrease the pain related to an outbreak and can shorten healing time. they can also decrease the total number of outbreaks. drugs including famvir zovirax and valtrex are among the drugs used to treat the symptoms of herpes. warm baths may relieve the pain associated with genital sores. preventing the spread of genital herpes is extremely important. if you have genital herpes you can still spread the disease if you have no symptoms. although daily antiviral medication reduces the risk of spreading genital herpes it doesn’t totally eliminate the risk. a herpes vaccine is in the works but unfortunately has not been perfected at this time. that is why practicing safe sex and using a condom are the keys to preventing the spread of genital herpes.	what doctors are best for dealing with hsv-2? . my general practitioner has not had the experience in dealing with this condition.

it's difficult to say exactly why your wife isn't losing weight without more information but here are some things to consider: how is she tracking her calories? it is possible that she is getting more than she thinks she is. seeing a registered dietitian can help her examine her food intake for hidden calories. high levels of activity mixed with low calorie intake may increase cortisol (levels stress hormone) and cause weight to stay where it is. this is a theory but i have seen it many times. your wife can experiment with cutting back the exercise or increasing her calorie intake. unless she's enjoying the exercise it likely isn't sustainable so i suggest she focused on doing something she enjoys. if your wife did not exercise at all before it is possible she is gaining some muscle mass and losing fat even the scale isn't moving. other factors can cause weight to plateau such as stress and lack of sleep. see this webmd article for more ideas. weight loss -- and especially weight loss maintenance -- can be a challenging task. i suggest your wife get help and support with the process. the key is to address the reasons for the weight gain in addition to tackling food and exercise. i had the same issue. 1-2hours a day in the gym cardio and weights 4-5 days a wk eating 1200 calories only lost 2 lbs in 4 months. turns out there is so much msg in food that it was hindering my progress. i switched to eating only organic food with light exercise and lost 5 lbs. in one week. i also stopped getting head aches and back aches. i even gained energy and improved disposition.

athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the skin of the foot. most athlete's foot is caused by one of two types of fungus. trichophyton mentagrophytes often causes toe web or vesicular (blisterlike) infections. the infection appears suddenly is severe and is easily treated. trichophyton rubrum often causes moccasin-type infections. this condition lasts for a long time (chronic) and is difficult to treat. you get athlete’s foot when you come in contact with the fungus and it begins to grow on your skin. fungi commonly grow on or in the top layer of human skin and may or may not cause infections. fungi grow best in warm moist areas such as the area between the toes. athlete's foot is easily spread (contagious)-you can get it by touching the affected area of a person who has it. more commonly you pick up the fungi from damp contaminated surfaces such as the floors in public showers or locker rooms. although athlete's foot is contagious some people are more likely to get it ( susceptible ) than others. susceptibility may increase with age. experts don't know why some people are more likely to get it. after you have had athlete's foot you are more likely to get it again. if you come in contact with the fungi that cause athlete's foot you can spread the fungi to others whether you get the infection or not. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes athletes foot?

the drugs levosulpiride and flupentixol will cause side effects like reduced libido or erectile dysfunction. levosulpiride results in increased prolactin concentration and thus ultimately poor erection. as you have stopped the medicines just a week back it will take time to normalize the hormone levels. in most cases potency improves in about four to eight weeks. so do not remain stressed. be calm and relaxed. the problem will reduce in some time. the probable causes:drug induced hyperprolactinemia. investigations to be done:serum prolactin and testosterone if needed. treatment plan:wait and watch. if needed pde-5 (phosphodiesterase-5) inhibitors can help. regarding follow up:for further information consult a sexologist online. ---> <link>	Hi doctor.I am 32 years old.

"when a man is often able to orgasm but takes a very long time (typically 45 mins or longer) this may be called ""delayed ejaculation"". this is different than ""inhibited ejaculation"" which can result in a man often not having an orgasm at all. there are a wide range of causes and often this is helped by meeting with a sex therapist. meeting with a doctor to rule out medical conditions that may be getting in the way of penile sensation is also often helpful (conditions such as diabetes). in the mean time some men find it helpful to use a vibrator together with their partner. increasingly there are more couples vibrators available on the market including the we-vibe which is worn partially inside a woman's body during intercourse. less expensive but also somewhat less intense are vibrating condom rings available in many drug stores. some men orgasm more easily with intense vibration such as the accuvibe or hitachi magic wand. couples may hold this between partners' bodies which can feel pleasurable for both partners. some men alternatively find pleasure from holding the vibrator to their penis while their partner kisses them. this can help to ease orgasm for the man while making it easier for his partner to assist as well."	how can a man orgasm more quickly?

all of the combination oral contraceptives can cause weight gain. the estrogen in them promotes water retention. but the weight gain from birth control pills is usually transient and goes away with continued use. the amount of weight gain may be decreased with lower-dose versions and with the progestins that are less like testosterone. those that contain desogestrel norgestimate or drospirenone tend not to stimulate the appetite so much. talk to your doctor about which birth control pill is the best one for you. one might gain weight while being on contraceptives but it cannot be held as a fact that the reason of the weight gain are the contraceptives. to demonstrate that the only reason women tend to get bigger while on contraceptives is by being part of an experiment monitoring every eating habits sleep schedule and activity. otherwise all accusations of weight gain being correlated to birth control pills are false. <link>	what oral contraceptives are likely to cause less weight gain?
hearing the diagnosis of “cancer” is quite simply a shock to the system. the first reaction is often panic followed by a tidal wave of emotions: “how can this be? ” “why me? ” “i’m scared and not able to handle this. ” but handle it you must. the following is a list of essential things that anyone newly diagnosed with cancer should know. 1. understand the diagnosis. there are many different types of cancer even within the same broad category. for example breast cancer has three general categories: hormone receptor positive (for the estrogen and/or progesterone receptors) her2 positive and triple negative (hormone receptors and her2 are negative or not present); the three types are often treated very differently. nearly every type of cancer has different sub-types and it is important to know which one you have. 2. do not jump the gun and think the worst. not all cancers of the same type act the same. some “bad” cancers may be curable. get all the facts straight and get them only from the experts who treat the disease not from physicians who are not cancer experts and not from well-meaning friends and family who “know someone with…” 3. meet first with local specialists. what other tests are needed to fully determine the stage or extent of the cancer in the body? do you need surgery chemotherapy and/or radiation? have these questions answered first in your community near where you live or work. physicians that specialize in treating cancer have been highly trained whether they practice in a community setting or at a large medical center. since cancer treatment may not be a one shot deal but can involve six months or more of therapy it is important to make these treatments as convenient and safe as possible. having a good cancer center close to home can make a world of difference. 4. consider a second opinion. the need for a second opinion depends on the quality of the first opinions you receive and on your preferences as a patient. do not think that the grass is greener elsewhere and that an incurable cancer is curable at a more heavily advertised center. if the cancer specialists in your area have an excellent reputation and you like their approach to you and your cancer then you may not feel that another opinion is necessary. on the other hand if you feel that surgery is better performed at a high volume center for example or you just want the peace of mind that comes with confirmation of treatment recommendations then a second opinion is right for you. the best doctors do not dissuade patients from seeking other opinions nor from receiving cancer care close to home when that is more convenient.	i’m newly diagnosed with cancer. what are some important things for me to know?

type 1 diabetes develops when your child's pancreas stops producing enough insulin. insulin lets blood sugar-also called glucose-enter the body's cells where it is used for energy. without insulin the amount of sugar in the blood rises above a safe level. as a result your child experiences high and low blood sugar levels from time to time. high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nerves throughout the body and increases your child's risk of eye kidney heart blood vessel and nerve diseases. experts do not know what causes type 1 diabetes. but the cause may involve family history and maybe environmental factors like diet or infections. causes of high blood sugar skipping a dose of insulin or eating more than usual experiencing emotional stress having an illness such as the flu or an infection taking certain medicines that can raise blood sugar levels such as medicines that reduce swelling and inflammation (corticosteroids) and growth hormone experiencing the dawn phenomenon or the somogyi effect which causes high blood sugar in the morning entering puberty. hormonal changes affect how well the body uses insulin. these changes can cause higher blood sugar levels causes of low blood sugar taking too much insulin skipping or delaying a meal or snack being more physically active than usual without eating enough food taking certain medicines that may lower blood sugar levels such as those that reduce fever and pain webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes type 1 diabetes children living with the disease?

most couples are able to become pregnant within the first 12 months of having regular unprotected sex. if after a year of trying a woman under 35 is still not pregnant then a checkup is in order to see if there is a problem. there are many reasons why a couple may have a problem getting pregnant. sometimes it is a health issue for the man and sometimes it is a health issue for the woman. a woman can have a problem with her hormones or with her womb or fallopian tubes. a man may not have enough healthy sperm. sometimes both the man and woman can have an infertility problem. just because you are not pregnant yet does not mean that you can’t have a healthy baby. you should make an appointment with your gynecologist and have your partner see his doctor or urologist to see what may be the cause. your doctor will most likely give you a prenatal vitamin to be sure that your pregnancy gets a healthy start. in the meantime make sure you are eating a healthy diet. get enough exercise. and avoid tobacco alcohol and any drugs that have not been prescribed by your doctor. for more information check out this link to webmd’s infertility and reproduction health center. <link>	hi um 21 years old and i have been trying to get pregnant for almolst 2 years

the shingles vaccine zostavax contains a weakened chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster virus). the shingles vaccine helps stimulate your immune system to battle disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus reducing the risk of getting shingles in people aged 50 and older. in scientific studies the shingles vaccine reduces the risk of developing shingles by about 50%. findings show that the shingles vaccine also helps people with shingles have shorter periods of nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia (phn) which is extremely painful and can last anywhere from 30 days to months or even years after the rash has resolved. the nerve pain associated with shingles can be so severe in some people that it disrupts their lives. not only does the shingles vaccine help prevent shingles in the person receiving the immunization but the shingles vaccine also helps prevent shingles in those who are around unvaccinated people. because shingles is a contagious viral infection the shingles vaccine works to stop the spread of the virus just like childhood immunizations for varicella or measles mumps and rubella. if a person with shingles passes the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox the newly infected person will develop chickenpox not shingles.	what does the shingles vaccine do?
it is often recommended to limit a newborn's exposure to potential infection during the first 4 - 8 weeks of life. for this reason alone it may be best to wait until your baby is 6-8 weeks old. waiting until after a month not only reduces some of the concerns asociated with exposure to infection but nursing may be better established as will the baby's routine. i have read that airlines will not allow a baby to fly that is less than 1 week old. i have also read some health care professionals say that babies as young as 2 weeks old can fly if needed. however since women are at increased risk for blood clots following delivery it may be best to wait a little while longer than 1 or 2 weeks for both mother's health and the baby's health. bottom line: if there is a compelling need to fly with your baby it can be done very early but you are likely best off waiting for at least 4 - 8 weeks. you should confer with your pediatrician for advice and check with your airline for their regulations as well.	how soon after a baby is born can you take him on an airplane?

fruit smoothies are fine with the exception of those calories which can be surprisingly high. not all smoothies are created equal you know. if you are trying to lose weight i think it would be wise to limit these as a sole breakfast option. once in a while is fine. you will lose more weight and get a bit more mileage if you ate a piece of fruit and had some protein in the morning (like an egg) and a piece of dry toast. less calories. well no. if fruits are healthy then fruit smoothies are not bad either. but watch how much you take in because too much of anything including fruit smoothies can cause health problems like diabetes. that ius when your body cannot process sugar so the food or drink will become extra body fat. at the same time it is good to excersize. so dont worry fruit smoothies are not bad for you.	are fruit smoothies bad. i have done very well at loosing weight and feeling better and i drink fresh fuit smoothies for breakfast that i make myself what i want to know is is there a danger to eating this during the work week every morning for breakfast. i am not concerned about the weight dangers as i eat a lower calorie diet is there any bad effects of drinking these for breakfast on a regular basis.

"that's a good question. i can see why you might make that connection since both cystic fibrosis (cf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) involve the lungs. cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that causes mucus throughout the body to become thick and sticky. this becomes very evident in the lungs where there's a lot of mucus. in order to get cf a child must inherit a gene defect from both parents. if only one parent passes along the gene mutation that causes cf the child is called a cf ""carrier"" because if he or she has a child with another person who is a cf carrier their child will have cystic fibrosis. if you are a cf carrier you do not have the disease and cannot get the disease. cf is not in any way related to copd which is usually caused by external factors such as smoking tobacco. copd is not an inherited disease and cannot be ""caught"" from another person. copd is not in any way related to -- or associated with -- carrying the cystic fibrosis gene mutation. if a cystic fibrosis carrier develops copd this is in no way related to the person's genetic status and the cf gene mutation in no way affects the individual's copd. wishing you well!"	can being a cf carrier cause copd symptoms to accelerated?

i can't examine you to determine the extent of your umbilical hernia so surgery may only be cosmetic. it is really up to you to get it fixed butif it is a particular big and bulging one this may be an approach to consider. talk to a general surgeon -- someone who repairs these -- for patient-specific advice.	it's been 22 years should i get my umbilical hernia fixed? . i have gotten a ct scan done on my abdominal and pelvic area about a month ago and i was told that i have an umbilical hernia. my doctor doesn't want me to treat it because he doesn't think it has anything to do with my nausea. when i told my mom she said that i had an umbilical hernia since i was born. i've researched that after birth they usually go away in about 3 or 4 years on its own. should it be something i should worry about? should i get surgery to get it fixed?
"i don't know what you mean by you ""don't have time for this. "" curing a vitamin d deficiency is as easy as taking a pill once a day. low vitamin d levels have been associated with bone pain general muscle weakness and even cancer (thought that's unlikely in a young person). it's doubtful your sleepiness and lack of concentration are due to vitamin d deficiency but i suppose anything's possible. you don't need any ""other test"" to determine the cause of your low vitamin d levels. it's pretty simple: you're not consuming enough vitamin d and you're not getting enough sunlight on your skin. this is a very common problem. on the one hand we medical professionals tell people to wear sunscreen. on the other hand we tell them they're deficient in vitamin d. the solution is to continue wearing sunscreen when you go in the sun for prolonged periods of time and to take vitamin d supplements. if you have no personal or family history of skin cancer you probably are safe to get 15-30 minutes of sun per day on your skin. this will help boost your vitamin d levels. given how very deficient you are in vitamin d i hope you took the prescribed 50 000 iu of vitamin d every other day until the prescription was gone. the usual length of therapy is a couple of weeks. you should get re-tested if you have not already done so. and then you may need to continue taking inexpensive vitamin d supplements for awhile until your levels are within normal range. please note you should not continue taking 50 000 iu of vitamin d indefinitely. that's a very large dose. if you have any questions consult your health care provider. wishing you well! i don't believe the answer is always so cut and dry. my vitmain d level has been low and getting lower for at least 5 years now. i don't tolerate the heat or sunshine so i don't get very much sun. but i have been pushing myself to tolerate it. but i've been on several very high courses of good quality vitamin d supplements and the mainstays of my diet are all vitamin d rich. but there was never even a slight rise in my levels. at last check my levels were in the single digits. incidentally i am always tired and always in pain these days. absolutely! i have had similar symptoms along with cardiac and autoimmune disorders. my vitamin d level is 13 and has runned low for years. i too never worried about vitamin d but i've found out that it's a huge problem and runs in my family related to synthesis problems of vitamins and enzymes. have levels check regularly even after normal labs and please take your vitamin d with lots of sunshine and diet rich in vitamin d c b12 calcium etc. i've gotten much better! they all work together. what i meant is i don't have time to feel so down with all my responsibilities i did start taking the pill recently. i was asking what other tests can i do to determine the cause of feeling sleepy all the time and having concentration issues and if it's somehow related to my vitamin d insufficiency. nonetheless thank you for putting time and answering. greatly appreciate all the answers."	vitamin d level was 15? my doctor prescribed 50 000 iu every other day. details are below. so my vitamin d level was 15 last year i did nothing about it unfortunately but i was. -always sleepy. - i would take long naps during the day. -i can't concentrate. - anxious. -knee pain once in a while it starts hurting and feeling really stiff goes away with rest. i feel bad because i'm in college and i don't have time for this i have lots of work to do. do you guys think this is because of my vitamin d levels? also what other tests should i do to determine the cause? thanks a lot.
about your family to catch it ot not. the skin-to-skin contact needs to be for a reasonable time to catch the mite. you usually need to be in skin contact for 15-20 minutes to catch scabies. therefore you are unlikely to catch scabies from an infected person by casual short contact such as a handshake or a hug. the more mites there are the faster they can spread to another person. 2nd …they will not go alone a medical treatment must be continued fully to the end if infection. maintain high hyegine habits. wash clothes and towels at high temperature 50•	I have scabies, will my family get them?

you may benefit from oral finasteride (propecia) or topical minoxidil (rogaine) applied to the affected areas daily. propecia works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dht (dihydrotestosterone) at the level of the hair follicle. this reaction halts the ongoing hair miniaturization process and helps to regrow new hairs while thickening original hairs.	what is the best way to prevent hair loss for men?
most helpful answer the key for diabetes is keeping carbohydrate intake consistent throughout the day. oatmeal is a healthy carbohydrate-rich food that is beneficial for heart health and can fit in a healthy diet. you want to work with your healthcare provider on how many carbohydrates you need in a day. the american diabetes association recommends 45-60 grams of carbohydrate at a meal (3-4 carbohydrate servings). one half cup of oatmeal without added sugars contains about one carbohydrate serving (15 grams). if you add to tablespoons raisins that is another carbohydrate serving. the benefit of carbohydrate counting is you have flexibility about what you eat as long as you stay within your recommended carbohydrate intake. but choosing carbohydrates that are nutritous like oatmeal (and other whole grains) fruits and dairy is important for a healthy diet. if you need help see a diabetes educator for more assistance. for more information on carb counting see this article <link> i am a type 2diabetic and eat oats every morning. one of the first things i was taught was to add a good fat or protein to a carb breakfast. i eat 1/3rd cup of steel cut organic oats cooked in water 6 oz. of almond milk 1tsp cinnimon and 1 tbs. of almond butter. i also eat one cup of fruit but eat the fruit 1hr prior to the oats. this wait time allows the fruit to digest before the oats start to digest. i have been taught also to not eat a startch or grain carb together with a fruit as the stomach treats this combination by frementation during digestion. my blood sugars are norml eating this way. total carbs for this meal is around 66grams which is high but eating this way negates the high blood sugars!	"i love oatmeal and i am a diabetic. is it good to eat in a regular basis? . the issue is that i read that some doctors say that oatmeal is alright but you must be careful with it as a major part of your diet but others say it is fine as long as it is not loaded up with all the ""nice"" things that make oatmeal so good like brown sugar and raisans which makes sense because of the high carbo content."

it's always a bit unsettling to see blood in the urine -- or anywhere it's not supposed to be! a small amount of blood in the urine is not uncommon when you have a urinary tract infection (uti). have you been diagnosed with a uti by your health care provider? if not you should not assume blood (even just a pinkish tinge) in the urine is enough to diagnose a uti. blood in the urine can be a symptom of other conditions and definitely needs to be evaluated by a health care professional. a urinary tract infection requires treatment with antibiotics. so if you think you have a uti you should make an appointment to see your primary care provider. by the way the jury is still out on the value of cranberry in treating or preventing utis. the most recent study on this topic showed that cranberry has virtually no value in treating or preventing urinary tract infections. i mention this so that you don't delay getting professional treatment in order to try cranberry juice or supplements. best wishes to you!	is it normal to have pinkish red (blood) when you have a uti?

yes anemia may be genetic. hereditary disorders can shorten the lifespan of the red blood cell and lead to anemia (for example sickle cell anemia). hereditary disorders can also cause anemia by impairing the production of hemoglobin (for example alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia). depending on the degree of the genetic abnormality hereditary anemias may cause mild moderate or severe anemia. in fact some may be too severe to be compatible with life and may result in death of the fetus (unborn infant). on the other hand some of these anemias are so mild that they are not noticeable and are incidentally revealed during a routine blood work.	can anemia be hereditary?

sports drinks were developed to replace the water and electrolytes lost by training athletes. for athletes who spend long hours training in hot environments some supplementation with these electrolytes may make sense but for almost all ordinary child and adolescent athletes under ordinary circumstances the only thing that needs to be replaced is water. the extra sugars and vitamins won’t do anyone any good. coaches should concentrate on encouraging the best habits for young athletes: drinking water before during and after exercise. energy drinks are different. in addition to electrolytes (especially sodium) they often contain caffeine or caffeine-like compounds along with a witch’s brew of amino acids and herbal products like inositol ginsing taurine and carnitine. vitamins are often thrown into the mix as well. the calorie count of energy drinks is even higher than that of sports drinks and none of these additives is likely to genuinely improve performance — in fact it’s far more likely that children especially will experience toxic side effects rather than any kind of athletic “boost” from these concoctions.	are sports and energy drinks safe for kids?

yes. hand foot and mouth disease (hfmd) is caused by viruses from a group called enteroviruses. hfmd is common in infants and children but can also affect adults. symptoms can include fever sore throat and blistering sores in the mouth that become ulcers. a rash may appear on the palms and soles of the hands and feet. hfmd is spread through virus-contaminated secretions from the nose throat saliva or blister fluid. a person can still transmit the virus to others for weeks after symptoms resolve. hand foot and mouth disease has nothing to do with foot-and-mouth disease a disease that affects livestock. foot-and-mouth (or hoof-and-mouth) is caused by a different virus and people can’t catch the disease from animals. yes my daughter got hand foot and mouth disease from her daughter that is 20 months old. it is a nasty and terrible virus. your throat feels like razors blades are in it your body feels like you have pneumonia. my granddaughter and daughter have suffered terrible with this virus and there seems to be nothing that helps! do i need to go to the emergency room?	can adults get hand foot and mouth disease?

i'm sorry your bladder issue is disrupting your sleep. how annoying! since you're already taking an appropriate medication i suggest you have a chat with your health care provider to see if the dosage is right. or maybe you need a different medication for the overactive bladder. one thing you can do is stop drinking fluids close to bedtime. i realize oxybutynin can cause dry mouth and other unpleasant side effects but cutting of liquids within a couple of hours of bedtime might help you avoid waking up at night. the best advice though is to discuss this nighttime urination problem with your health care provider to get personalized advice. best of luck to you!	i keep getting up to urinate in the middle of night. what can i do to stop? . i am a 38 year old female with oab. i am currently being treated with oxybutynin er 15 mg.

i have a great recipe that will fill the house with delicious smells can be made the night before and will give you sustained energy for the day (and will not have the kids sugar-crashing first thing in the morning). i highly recommend using sprouted whole grain bread like alvarado street or ezekiel brands. you will get protein fiber as well as other vital nutrients. the prep time on this is under 10 minutes and you don’t have to think about it again until the next morning. you will need a large baking dish 1-3 slices of bread per person (one for the little ones and light eaters). use 6 egg whites ¼ cup fresh orange juice 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon for every 4 pieces of bread (so double this if you are using 8 slices). mix the eggs juice and spices together. spray your baking dish with olive oil cooking spray or rub lightly with butter. lay the first layer with bread and pour on the egg mixture to thoroughly coat the bread. add your next layer of bread and pour the rest of your batter over. let sit overnight or at least a few hours before cooking. bake at 400 degrees for 30-40 minutes depending on your oven (you want it to be moist in the center and brown on top). drizzle maple syrup over the top sprinkle with cinnamon and serve.	how can i make a healthy breakfast ahead of time?

i'd suggest you see a doctor about this. you can start with your primary care provider and he or she will refer you to an orthopedic doctor if necessary. you don't say exactly what kind of surgery you had in 2009. i'm thinking it was an arthroscopy to remove pieces of the meniscus. if this is the case and you're experiencing new or worsening symptoms you'd be well served to see a health care provider. i wouldn't necessarily recommend wearing a knee brace. you could reduce your range of motion and have a hard time getting it back. the only way to truly solve this problem is to get an examination by a health care provider. he or she can discuss with you all the various options from physical therapy to surgery that can help solve your knee problem. good luck! there are promising new treatments that are being developed using stem cells to stimulate cartiledge growth. your orthopedic surgeon is focused on surgery so he probably won't mention this and may not know about it. after having one successful knee replacement (arthritis) i'm biding my time till this treatment becomes available for the other knee.	should i wear a knee brace since i had surgery and now have oa. damaged the inside right meniscus due to working seven days a week and lifting and pushing heavy stock. had surgery in 09 ever since my knee has stayed swollen gives out or locks up more often severe pain shooting throught it and it is bone on bone now. so do i need to get a brace and wear and perhaps look into some treatments that might help to rebuild the damaged knee?

you know when a woman goes through perimenopause the most important thing she can do is to be positive about this experience and not let it get to her. i try to tell patients this is a period a normal natural transition we all go through it and it will get better after the menopause. patients should get their vitamins they should do their exercise they should look for herbal remedies if it is possible they can take them there are a lot of natural herbal remedies and lastly if all that doesn’t work then they can go on bioidentical low dose hormones to get them through this period and it’s not dangerous. you’re not going to stay on it indefinitely and it could help your symptoms and make them feel more normal.	what can i do to cope with perimenopause symptoms?
a tiny amount of blood would not be a cause for alarm. the skin lining of the ear canal is rich in blood supply so you most likely irritated it when you used the q-tip. it is best to never use q-tips inside the ear canal. one of reasons water had a difficult time coming out of ears is because you do not have a adequate protective coating of (ear) wax. when water meets a waxy surface it will just bead up and fall out by gravity but if you do not have a waxy surface the water will remain.	i had water in my ear. i put a q-tip in to absorb it. not far in but it had a tiny bit of red blood on it when removed. . my right ear has always given me a problem because i use a syringe to clean out my ear when i was a teenager and it hurt all day long. now it always is very sensitive and hurts when you put anything in it. do i need to see a doctor about this ear?

most helpful answer everything i have read says cold. if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal. heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed. this is to increase circulation and promote healing. more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone-like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body. so if you can move do. lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery. the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re-construct those damaged tissues. this information is from exercise physiology.	is it better to apply heat or cold to sore muscles after stenuous exercise?

recent studies show that a combination treatment of botox and fillers works better than either treatment alone. botox and fillers such as restylane perlane prevelle juvederm and radiesse perform differently. botox paralyzes the underlying facial muscle while fillers plump the skin and smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. young people with only superficial lines may just need mainly botox. but botox is not going to make deep forehead furrows or marionette lines(the vertical creases that run from mouth to chin) disappear – for that people need fillers. the problem with fillers is that sooner or later they break down and are absorbed by the body. the more animated and active the face the faster the filler will break down. prevelle one of the lighter fillers lasts about four months while perlane and juvederm ultra plus last about eight months to a year. however the duration of any filler will significantly increase if botox shots are given first in the same sitting. for the forehead for example i inject botox into the lines followed immediately by fillers. instead of the usual five to six months with a smooth forehead if a filler alone is used the combination treatment will last nine to ten months. and the forehead will look a whole lot better during that time because the etched-in lines will be smoothed away. botox and fillers can even be used around the mouth which is where fillers break down fastest. think about it: your mouth is in constant movement every waking moment and the more movement there is the faster the filler will break down. botox should never be injected into the smile lines but diluted botox shots can be used successfully with fillers on the lips and the corners of the mouth on most people. there are exceptions though: people who need extremely mobile lips for their professions such as singers or horn players should never get botox near their mouths although they can have fillers.	do fillers work better when used in conjunction with botox?

yes allegra is the same as fexofenadine. every medication has two names a brand and a generic name. the original creators are the only ones who can use the brand name. once the recipe becomes available to other drug manufacturers they sell the product under the generic name. it usually takes approximately seven years for the brand to go generic. the main active ingredient has to remain the same in each recipe. what differs from the brand and generic are the inactive ingredients that can hold the medication together and that give it its color. in addition the generic can be much more affordable. most generics are fda approved to be equally effective. therefore if the generic works for you then there is no need to switch. also make sure to only take one and not both the brand and generic to prevent overdosing and additive side effects.	is fexofenadine the same as allegra for allergies?

if your symptoms bother you your doctor may give you pills called beta-blockers. they can help you feel better while you and your doctor decide what your treatment should be. even if your symptoms do not bother you you still need treatment because hyperthyroidism can lead to more serious problems. radioactive iodine and anti-thyroid medicine are the treatments doctors use most often. the best treatment for you will depend on a number of things including your age. some people need more than one kind of treatment. after treatment you will need regular blood tests to see if your hyperthyroidism has come back. they also check to see if you are making enough thyroid hormone. sometimes treatment cures hyperthyroidism but causes the opposite problem -- too little thyroid hormone. if this happens you may need to take thyroid hormone pills permanently.	how is hyperthyroidism treated?
most cases of hypothyroidism in the united states are caused by hashimoto's thyroiditis which cannot be prevented. although you cannot prevent hypothyroidism you can watch for signs of the disease so it can be treated promptly. some people who are at high risk of having hypothyroidism but do not have symptoms can be tested to see whether they have mild or subclinical hypothyroidism. expert groups differ in their recommendations for screening: the american thyroid association recommends that all adults be tested beginning at age 35 and continuing every 5 years. 7 older adults especially women older than 60 those with a family history of hypothyroidism and those with addison's disease rheumatoid arthritis pernicious anemia and type 1 diabetes should also be tested according to these recommendations. the u. s. preventive services task force makes no recommendation for or against thyroid screening for people who do not have symptoms of hypothyroidism. its statement indicates there is not enough evidence to support screening. 8 another panel of experts from several medical specialties recommends against widespread screening. 4 but these health professionals say that if you are high risk you may want to be screened. those at high risk include women older than age 60 and people who have type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune diseases. 4 talk to your doctor about whether you should be screened. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	how can hypothyroidism be prevented?

i am glad that you went to the doctor for an exam and testing. from what you have described it does not sound like herpes. a primary (new) infection typically takes 2 to 14 days to present itself. a herpes outbreak typically lasts 1-3 weeks and consists of blisters which cause pain itching and burning.	noticed a rash on my butt most receded next day except two now-scabs which have not hurt/itched at all. is this herpes? . the day after a sexual encounter i noticed a rash on my buttocks on the skin surrounding the crack (but not near the anus). however the next day the majority of the rash disappeared except two bumps about half an inch apart for each other. it has been 5 days and the bumps have scabbed over but throughout the process the bumps did not itch burn or cause any noticeable discomfort at all. i am waiting for the blood work to come back but am doing some research in the meantime.

many factors can change your body's need for iron. for example going through menopause puts women at lower risk for iron deficiency due to the loss of menses. many times someone starts to take iron supplements and also increases iron in their diet meaning they eventually get too much iron once their stores are repleted. here are some ways to decrease your iron intake: if you take a multivitamin take one without iron check the label and eliminate foods fortifed with iron (e. g. cereals energy bars waffles etc. ) lastly you can decrease the amount of meat products you eat. the iron in animal foods (heme) is better absorbed than plant foods (none-heme). this article outlines which foods are high in iron <link> make sure you continue to work with your healthcare provider and check your iron levels so the other problem doesn't come back. seeing a registered dietitian can also help. you can find one at eatright. org.	how can i reduce my iron levels? . my iron (per blood test) is 266. my doctor wants me to lower my iron. is there a diet plan out there that will help me accomplish that? this is bewildering to me. 3yrs ago my doctor had me on iron because it was low. what can trigger it to be high now?

communicating wishes for medical treatment in advance of a crisis is one of the most important steps we can take. many legal tools are available for this purpose. none quite as valuable however as the health care proxy according to charlie sabatino director of the american bar association's commission on law and aging. a health care proxy (also called a health care power of attorney) appoints another person to make health care decisions for you in cases when you are unable to do so for yourself. that's why it's so important to choose someone you trust and who knows your wishes to weigh the medical facts of your particular situation and make decisions most closely aligned with what you would decide for yourself. to help you think through the process the american bar association offers a consumer's tool kit for health care advance planning on its website. included in the tool kit is a proxy quiz developed to provoke in-depth discussions about a person's wishes so that everyone is on the same page.	how do i put together a health care proxy?

research has shown that with the advent of low-fat foods americans have actually gotten fatter. the truth is that a low-fat or reduced fat food may have the same or more calories than its fully fatted rival. that’s because if fat is reduced in a food item sugar is often increased. also seeing the words “low-fat” or “fat free” is a green light for many people to overeat. one study showed that people ate 28% more candies if these treats were labeled “low-fat” instead of “regular. ” scientists have suggested that people believe that low-fat = low calorie and thus over eat and underestimate the total calories they are consuming. no	is eating primarily low-fat food the best way to shed pounds?

acute sinusitis should be treated with 10 days of amoxicillin and what you are having is acute on chronic sinusitis. i would suggest completing the course for next five days. continue the steaming and use saline nasal spray. do not blow your nose so hard. if the antihistamine is making your nose dry then do not use it use paracetamol for pain relief. allegra (fexofenadine) is a good medication but sometimes can cause nasal dryness. once the nasal dryness is cured you can also use nasal steroid that has fluticasone or use nasonex (mometasone) or nasacort (triamcinolone). use one spray in each nostril throughout the spring season. for further information consult an internal medicine physician online --> <link>	Hi doctor,Initially, I had cold and cough, which now turned into sinus.

you will need to go without lipstick until your symptoms abate. if you think it was a reaction don't use this one again. wash your lips off carefully with mild soap and water and apply some 1% hydrocortisone ointment. your lips will look shiny (like vaseline) but it should help that burning. if i were you i'd probably break open a vitamin e capsule rub it on my lips before bed and let it soak in overnight. that does amazing things for healing. sometimes medicated lip balms can be a real problem especially if your lips are already irritated. but vitamin e oil does wonders for delicate skin like that.	i had a reaction to one of the lipsticks i was using. my lips are very sore and have a burning sensation. what to use. i had some kind of reaction on my lips to one of the glosses or lipsticks i was using. my lips are very sore and when i try to apply lipstick they really burn. i think they are irritated. what can i use on them so they will get better. i keep using the medex for lips which usually helps but am having a hard time getting them cleared up. help i am desperate. hate going without lipstick.

it's really important to have an aesthetic physician which would be a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon to do these techniques and these treatments in order to have the most natural lasting results. these are treatments that are very technique sensitive. we have great ingredients. but they have to be done in the proper way in the proper plane of the skin so sometimes it's more superficial and sometimes it's deeper in the skin. we used different products for different parts of the face. so it is really important to see a doctor that you feel comfortable with to do these injections for you.	can a regular doctor inject fillers or do i need to see a plastic surgeon or dermatologist?

acetaminophen is used more as a fever reducer and for pain. ibuprofen which is also known as motrin or advil can be used for pain that's caused by inflammation. so the theory is is that if the area is inflamed that's really what's causing the pain. acetaminophen or tylenol is also referred to as apap in some formulations. you want to be careful. you want to make sure that you don't exceed more than 4 000 milligrams a day for an adult. if you are an elderly person you don't want to exceed 2 000 milligrams a day and you would want to avoid things like alcohol. they are noticing that there have been some challenges with acetaminophen in the cases of people taking too much of it. they weren't aware that they were taking prescription medications with acetaminophen in it. so you want to talk to your pharmacist first before you consider choosing these products. on the advil/motrin side once again you don't want to drink alcohol with them. it really helps create nausea. it could upset the stomach. if you have an ulcer it's not recommended. if you have asthma it's not recommended either because ibuprofen is a sister to aspirin and it could trigger an asthma attack. that's really some people are very sensitive to this class and that's why they shouldn't be taking it. so once again you want to come to the pharmacy you want to ask for the pharmacist. you want to come with your medication list show us what you are taking and then tell us what are your symptoms. in some cases if you have had a pain for a while we might refer you to a doctor or a healthcare provider to have it further evaluated.	what's the difference between acetaminophen and ibuprofen and what are the dangers of each?

"split fingertips can be absolutely miserable! i'm sorry you're experiencing this. usually these cracks and splits are caused simply by dry skin. these problems seem to be more prevalent in the winter when the air is dry and we're washing our hands more often which dries out the skin. my absolute favorite treatment for split fingertips is vitamin a & d ointment or cream. you can find this in the diaper rash aisle of any drugstore. a&d ointment is a very healing preparation. another thing you might try is a heavy greasy moisturizing cream such as ""bag balm"" or udder cream. these products usually can be found in the section of the store where the hand lotions are kept. lastly try coating your fingertips with your chosen moisturizer right before bed then putting on a pair of cotton gloves to sleep in. the gloves will keep the ointment on the fingers to do its job plus they'll keep the sheets from getting all greasy. i hope these tips give you some relief!"	what causes the cracks and splits on the ends of the fingers and what is the best way to treat?

as dermatologists and plastic surgeons we do a lot of treatments to help rejuvenate the hands. i find that besides the eyes the hands really can give away age very readily. so while we can make the face look so much better if you don't also treat the hands that can give things away. so besides lasers we can use dermal fillers to actually plump up and rejuvenate the skin of the hands in a very safe and effective way. ask you dermatologist or plastic surgeon if they are comfortable with this procedure and they will tell you if that's something that would be appropriate for you.	can a dermal filler fix my bony looking hands? who does these types of injections?

generally speaking your employer coverage is likely to be your best option. one main reason is that while pricey employers on average pay 70-80% of your insurance premium and that financial help is tax free. but i would encourage you to shop your options. to start do a quick search on a site like ehealthinsurance. com to see what the benefits and costs are to the plans available on the private market in your area and compare that to what your employer is offering.	for higher income employees is it better to get health insurance from your employer? . or should you get an individual or family plan from an insurance company? getting it from an exchange is too expensive.
i'm not sure if you're talking about surgery or some other type of treatment. but since i know about surgery i'll answer regarding that. low back pain that's caused by compression on a nerve root by something like a herniated disc can be effectively treated with surgery. in this type of surgery the doctor often removes the disc and replaces it with a spacer and a small piece of donated bone that will cause the vertebrae to fuse together after a period of time. however there are several different types of lower back surgery that are used to treat low back pain. you and your doctor will work together to determine what the best treatment plan is for your low back pain. it's important to note you may still experience pain even after surgery to decompress the spinal column in the lower back. i'm not sure if that's the information you were after but i hope it helps!	how effective is spinal decompression for low back pain?

"many of us with fm have to work and we may be faced with a major dilemma: our fibro interferes with our jobs. this creates stress often extreme financial stress if the job cannot be performed properly. whether the fm was caused by a work injury or whether work is aggravating the pre-existing fm changes may have to be made in how work is approached to minimize pain and functional impairment. job considerations: different factors influence our job abilities. we have a difficult time reaching using our arms overhead bending lifting and being in one position for a long time. we have no business even being in some of the jobs we do since the job duties are so unrealistic for us. even jobs that involve little or no lifting may not be tolerated if it involves a lot of reaching or repetitions. some examples of ""high risk"" jobs for us include assembly-line jobs hairstyling bus driving computer work and cashier jobs. even sedentary less physically demanding jobs can be stressful because it's hard to focus concentrate and be productive if we hurt all over have headaches and brain fog etc. we can come up with a list of work things to do that's best for our fm. i mean things that we can modify at work to keep us productive and with minimal pain despite our fibro. here are some examples of things that you your doctor and your therapist can try to do. --hours: stay on day shift avoid overtime can you have a flexible schedule? decrease commute time? is part-time more feasible? can you make up missed time? --building: can you park close? use elevator instead of stairs? --work environment: can you control the thermostat? avoid drafts bright lights noise. minimize interruptions/disruptions. is your furniture and work station ergonomically efficient? --physical: can you alternate positions? sit more? lie down during breaks? pace your work? --work load: can you rotate tasks? can you prioritize deadlines? delegate to others? can you ease pressure on work quotas? are others depending on your work before they can finish theirs? --insurance: is it adequate? paid medical leave? pharmacy plan? reasonable accomodations: the employee the employer and the doctor can work together to create a safe workplace with minimal pain hopefully. the americans with disabilities act requires employers to provide equal employment opportunities for people who are able to do the job but who are limited by physical disabilities. the employee has a right to reasonable accomodations provided by the employer to help overcome any physical limitations. examples of reasonable accommodations for fm workers might include: --allowing frequent breaks during the workday --rearranging work stations and providing ergonomic tools or furniture to optimize proper body mechanics and use fibronomics. --providing phones with headsets --using a drop keyboard wrist bars and arm rests on your computer --no direct air conditioning drafts --restrictions on repetitive activities. family medical leave act: the fmla was passed to allow workers to take time off work when they (or family members) are incapacitated and require medical treatment for a serious or chronic health condition. i complete these forms often when necessary and will state that fm is a chronic condition that may unpredictably flare up from time to time resulting in impairment of work ability and may require time off work on a temporary basis. we try to prioritize returning to work and staying at work as much as possible."	how can i deal with my fibromyalgia at work?

"losing weight can seem like an insurmountable task especially when you have a significant weight loss goal. but it turns out most people bounce around within a range of about 10 pounds -- depending on the time of year their motivation to exercise and whether a high school reunion is around the corner. it's amazing to consider what gaining or losing just 10 pounds can do for you. a study recently presented at the american heart association scientific sessions found that for every nine-pound increase in body weight a person's risk of developing heart disease increases by 50%. researchers tracked height weight and heart disease in over 80 000 people and found that there is a direct cause-and-effect link between body weight and this increase in heart disease. i find when advising patients about weight loss that there are several ways to encourage success. the first is to have a goal. not just a weight goal but also a health goal. we spend so much time concentrating on the ""how-to"" that we sometimes forget about the ""to-what. "" reducing your risk of heart disease is a tangible and realistic goal. second think small. when we feel motivated to lose weight and get healthy our enthusiasm sometimes gets the best of us and we set our goals to lofty heights. the problem with lofty goals is that it's harder to reach them and easier to get discouraged and go back to less healthy behaviors. so think small. ten pounds is a great place to start. you can tackle your first 10 pounds with these three easy weight-loss tips. 1. keep a food diary. record every single thing you eat and drink. studies show that this is the single most effective weight-loss tactic. the act of documenting your meals will impact the food choices you make. 2. weigh yourself -- every day. keeping close tabs on your weight will keep you honest with yourself and warn you if you start to stray in the wrong direction. 3. get enough sleep. research shows that sleeping more than seven hours each night is associated with weight loss. sleep tips your hunger hormones in the right direction."	can losing 10 pounds make a difference?
assuming you were fertile before the surgery yes. in standard gastric bypass surgery the surgeon makes an incision in the belly and cuts out most of the stomach. a portion of the small intestine is also cut and reattached to the new small stomach. all this cutting takes place well away from the reproductive organs (ovaries fallopian tubes uterus and vagina). direct damage to these organs is extremely unlikely and infertility is not considered to be a risk of weight loss surgery. on the contrary experts suspect that fertility sometimes goes up after gastric bypass surgery. there’s no proof that gastric bypass surgery directly increases fertility but it’s known that weight loss in general improves fertility. women are usually counseled to avoid pregnancy for a year or more after gastric bypass surgery to achieve maximum weight loss. the delay also allows time to correct any nutritional deficiencies that occur after the surgery. women who get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery usually have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. their rates of pregnancy complications may be lower than severely obese women who have not had weight loss surgery. yes i've done it	can you get pregnant after gastric bypass surgery?
i'm wondering why you would have your tsh tested twice so close together. usually with hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) it takes weeks of medication therapy to see any change in tsh levels so it doesn't make sense to me your doctor would have you tested just a few days apart. that said while a tsh value of 28 is high it should be fine to wait until thursday to see your doctor. as to why your tsh seems to be going up without you experiencing symptoms well many things can cause this. your doctor will be able to give you some possible reasons for this and (hopefully) get you on a path to better control. best wishes to you! staying at the wrong dosage amount for too long and fluctuate your levels and cause them to change and go from under to over.	what would make my tsh levels suddenly jump to critically high level when i feel the same? . i take synthroid 1. 25 daily and yet my tsh is now 28. 3 increased from 23. on friday. why would it jump so quickly? my dr. is on vacation and i just want to make sure this is ok to wait until thursday when he comes back. .
low blood pressure in healthy subjects without symptoms or organ damage needs no treatment. however all patients with symptoms possibly due to low blood pressure should be evaluated by a doctor. (patients who have had a major drop in blood pressure from their usual levels even without the development of symptoms also should be evaluated. ) the doctor needs to identify the cause of the low blood pressure; remedies will depend on the cause. for example if a medication is causing the low blood pressure the dose of medication may have to be reduced or the medication stopped though only after consulting the doctor. self-adjustment of medication should not be done. dehydration is treated with fluids and minerals (electrolytes). mild dehydration without nausea and vomiting can be treated with oral fluids and electrolytes. moderate to severe dehydration usually is treated in the hospital or emergency room with intravenous fluids and electrolytes. blood loss can be treated with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. continuous and severe bleeding needs to be treated immediately. septic shock is an emergency and is treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. blood pressure medications or diuretics are adjusted changed or stopped by the doctor if they are causing low blood pressure symptoms. bradycardia may be due to a medication. the doctor may reduce change or stop the medication. bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome or heart block is treated with an implantable pacemaker. tachycardia is treated depending on the nature of the tachycardia. atrial fibrillation can be treated with oral medications electrical cardioversion or a catheterization procedure called pulmonary vein isolation. ventricular tachycardia can be controlled with medications or with an implantable defibrillator. pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is treated with blood thinners intravenous initially with heparin and oral warfarin (coumadin) later. pericardial fluid can be removed by a procedure called pericardiocentesis. postural hypotension can be treated with changes in diet such as increasing water and salt intake* increasing intake of caffeinated beverages (because caffeine constricts blood vessels) using compression stockings to compress the leg veins and reduce the pooling of blood in the leg veins and in some patients the use of a medication called midodrine (proamatine). the problem with proamatine is that while it increases blood pressure in the upright position the supine blood pressure may become too high thus increasing the risk of strokes. mayo clinic researchers found that a medication used to treat muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis called pyridostigmine (mestinon) increases upright blood pressure but not supine blood pressure. mestinon an anticholinesterase medication works on the autonomic nervous system especially when a person is standing up. side effects include minor abdominal cramping or increased frequency of bowel movements. *note: increasing salt intake can lead to heart failure in patients with existing heart disease and should not be undertaken without consulting a doctor. postprandial hypotension refers to low blood pressure occurring after meals. ibuprofen (motrin) or indomethacin (indocin) may be beneficial. vasovagal syncope can be treated with several types of drugs such as beta blockers [for example propanolol (inderal inderal la)] selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [fluoxetine (prozac) escitalopram oxalate (lexapro) paroxetine (paxil) sertraline (zoloft) citalopram (celexa) fluvoxamine (luvox)] fludrocortisone (florinef) (a drug that prevents dehydration by causing the kidney(s) to retaining water). a pacemaker can also be helpful when a patient fails drug therapy.	how is low blood pressure treated?

the problem you describe with your boyfriend is very common. loud snoring occurs in almost 25% of the population. by itself snoring is not considered dangerous to health. however in about 5-7% of all men (and 2-4% of women) the snoring is associated with episodes of stopping breathing observed by a bed partner. additionally daytime fatigue and sleepiness may be present. when these symptoms are present with snoring sleep apnea is a possible diagnosis. other features of sleep apnea include headaches high blood pressure and repeated awakenings at night. sleep apnea is a serious medical condition and should be treated. one of the biggest risk factors for sleep apnea is being overweight. however having a small chin small mouth or other variations in the face bones can also increase the risk of sleep apnea. treatment of sleep apnea is most often with a cpap machine. oral appliances and surgery are alternatives but are not as effective as cpap. if you suspect that your boyfriend has sleep apnea observe him while he sleeps and try to determine if he stops breathing. you should go with him to his doctor and discuss his snoring and describe what you see when his is sleeping. mention his other symptoms as well. if his doctor thinks he has sleep apnea tests will likely need to be done. your doctor will need to order cpap or other treatments.	could my boyfriend's loud snoring indicate a health problem?
arthritis affects approximately one child in every 1 000 in a given year. fortunately most of these cases are mild. however approximately one child in every 10 000 will have more severe arthritis that doesn't just go away. many children have what is called an acute inflammatory arthritis following a viral or bacterial infection. this arthritis is often quite severe for a brief period but usually disappears within a few weeks or months. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (jra) is the most common type of arthritis that persists for months or years at a time. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is also now called juvenile arthritis or juvenile arthritis of unknown cause (juvenile idiopathic arthritis).	how common is arthritis in children?
"most cases of athlete's foot are barely noticeable with just slightly dry flaky skin. more extensive athlete's foot may look like red peeling dry skin areas on one or both soles of the feet. sometimes the dry flakes may spread onto the sides and tops of the feet. most commonly the rash is localized to just the bottoms of the feet. the space between the fourth and fifth toes also may have some moisture peeling and dry flakes. there are three common types of athlete's foot: soles of the feet also called ""moccasin"" type between the toes also called ""interdigital"" type and inflammatory type or blistering unusual cases may look like small or large blisters of the feet (called bullous tinea pedis) thick patches of dry red skin or calluses with redness. sometimes it may look like just mild dry skin without any redness or inflammation. athlete's foot may present as a rash on one or both feet and even involve the hand. a ""two feet and one palm"" presentation is a very common presentation of athlete's foot especially in men. hand fungal infections are called tinea manuum. the exact cause of why the infection commonly only affects one hand is not known. athlete's foot may also be seen along with ringworm of the groin (especially in men) or hand(s). it is helpful to examine the feet whenever there is a fungal groin rash called tinea cruris. it is important to treat all areas of fungal infection at one time to avoid re-infection. simply treating the soles and ignoring the concurrent fungal infection of toenails may result in recurrences of athlete's foot. it is important to evaluate and address all potential sources of fungal infection."	what does athlete's foot look like?

quality: stick to whole foods. abandon processed and refined products because they’re not real food just “food-like” products. i like to call them science fair projects. most are laced with refined sugars that play havoc with your insulin levels resulting in a never-ending appetite for more junk. keep it simple. veggies fruits lean proteins and whole grains. eat smart fats that are healthy and satisfying like avocados and nuts. don’t forget to combine protein and fiber like a high protein greek yogurt with walnuts and blueberries. quantity: even if you’re eating whole foods you still have to rein in the calories and control your portions. steamed raw and grilled veggies especially the watery ones you can feast on. watery not densely sugared fruits are best (apples oranges berries melons). be careful with the whole grains especially bread products rice and pasta. make sure you read the labels and stick with one serving when you eat. you’ll need 4-6 oz of lean protein at any one sitting. frequency: eat a balanced meal or snack every 3-4 hours. if you do you’ll feel satisfied enough to eat less throughout the day resulting in more rapid and effective weight removal. make sure to cut off eating after dinner (which should be ideally no later than 8pm). or if you’re up and moving around after dinner and are truly hungry a 100-150 calorie healthy snack is acceptable like a yogurt or cottage cheese or an ounce of cheese.	what’s the best diet for great glutes?

for people with diabetes who need an echocardiogram follow these guidelines unless your doctor tells you otherwise: if you take insulin to control your blood sugar ask your doctor what amount you should take the day of the test. often your doctor will tell you to take only half of your usual morning dose and to eat a light meal four hours before the test. if you take pills to control your blood sugar do not take your medication until after the test is complete. do not take your diabetes drug and skip a meal before the test. if you own a glucose monitor bring it with you to check your blood sugar levels before and after your test. if you think your blood sugar is low tell the lab personnel immediately. plan to eat and take your blood sugar medication following your test. i do not need echocardiogram!	what if i have diabetes and need an echocardiogram?

we need all healthcare leaders and personnel to act now to help stop cre. it’s critical for doctors to prescribe existing antibiotics very carefully in order to preserve these lifesaving drugs for as long as possible. otherwise cre could very well be the beginning of the end of antibiotics. other prevention steps include: • knowing if patients in your facility have cre o requesting immediate alerts when the lab identifies cre o alerting the receiving facility when a cre patient transfers and find out when a patient with cre transfers into your facility • protecting patients from cre o following contact precautions and hand hygiene recommendations when treating patients with cre o dedicating rooms and staff to cre patients whenever possible o prescribing antibiotics carefully o removing temporary medical devices such as catheters and ventilators as soon as possible cdc offers other cre prevention guidelines that have proven to reduce cre infections.	what can my doctor do to help stop the spread of cre infections?

choose endurance activities such as jogging aerobics bicycling rowing or swimming. exercise at a moderately intense level. you should be able to talk without running out of breath during the activity. exercise for more than 40 minutes. during the first 20 minutes your body taps into your sugar reserves (carbohydrates stored as blood glucose and muscle glycogen). between 20 to 40 minutes of exercise the body continues to use up your sugar reserves and starts to tap into your body fat. after 40 minutes the body starts to burn even more fat. choose aquatic workouts or exercise in the cold. this causes the body to burn more energy and melt fat more quickly. the body draws on its fat reserves to stay warm.	what types of exercise are better for weight loss?

"the most consistently cited risk factors are: increasing age being overweight and increased number of vaginal deliveries. number of deliveries by c-section does not increase prolapse risk. other associated factors can include irritable bowel syndrome constipation and overall poor health. african-american women are less likely to have symptomatic pelvic prolapse. one small study even found that having a history of stretch marks doubled one's risk for prolapse. ""stretch marks "" you might be thinking ""why would that be? "" the bones of the female pelvis do a great job protecting lower abdominal contents but they do not provide support. the pelvic organs are supported by the muscles in the pelvic floor and the ligaments which can attach from the organs to the bones. it has been theorized that pelvic muscle and ligament strength may be linked to strength of collagen. collagen along with fibrillin is decreased in women with stretch marks."	what are the risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse?

unfortunately most cancers of the esophagus are detected too late to be treated effectively. by the time cancer-related symptoms of chest pain weight loss and progressive difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) lead to the diagnosis the cancer has already spread beyond the esophagus to other organs. indeed there is evidence that survival is markedly improved in cancers detected during the course of surveillance for dysplasia or cancer in barrett's esophagus as compared with survival in cancers detected after cancer symptoms prompted medical attention. therefore physicians want to make the diagnosis of barrett's in gerd patients and then begin surveillance for cancer in such patients. the problem however as mentioned previously is that only 5% of all patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or cardia have had an endoscopy to show that they have barrett's esophagus. thus the challenge is to identify those gerd patients who have barrett's by screening patients with chronic gerd. yet sufficient research has not been done to establish guidelines for selecting which patients with gerd should be screened by endoscopy. for now until more data becomes available it seems reasonable that if a patient with gerd cannot be taken off acid-suppressing drugs after two to three years (because of persistent symptoms) an endoscopy should be done to see if barrett's esophagus is present. one endoscopy per lifetime in patients with gerd may be sufficient to screen for barrett's.	why is it important to screen patients with gerd to diagnose barrett's esophagus?

there are actually two kinds of side effects from radiation therapy -- early and late. early side effects such as nausea or fatigue are usually temporary. they develop during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after treatment ends but then improve. late side effects such as lung or heart problems may take years to develop and are often permanent when they do. the most common early side effects from radiation therapy are fatigue and skin problems. other early side effects such as hair loss and nausea are typically specific to the site being treated.	how soon might someone have side effects from radiation therapy?

self-discipline: have a conversation about personal responsibility. as a parent it’s our inclination to rescue our kids… which sometimes means making a special trip up to school to drop off the homework that got left on the kitchen table. but school gives children an opportunity to practice their life skills in a safe environment. let your child forget his homework and let him see the consequence of being disorganized. these are teaching moments. confidence: talk about making good decisions and sticking to them. a child with good self-esteem will to cave to peer pressure. she will lead and not follow. remember those words every exasperated parent has shouted: “if everyone else was jumping off of a bridge would you? ! ” make your child feel good about her reasoning and judgment. then you won’t have to worry that she will blindly follow others. exercise: if your child plays a sport exercise time is automatically part of his schedule. but many tweens and teens don’t exercise on a regular basis if they aren’t involved in a team sport. make physical activity part of your child’s daily routine. kids spend several hours a day sitting at a desk and then a few hours (or more) sitting down to do their homework. make exercise a priority and a mental health break. set media limits: twitter facebook cell phones text messaging video games tv shows and surfing the web… need i go on? as if school homework and after-school activities aren’t enough electronic communications and screen time can take up the rest of a child’s waking hours. make a family plan to spend time together without disruption from a tv or a friend who is calling or texting your child during dinner. turn off the electronics completely or set a curfew for them. sleep: sleep is powerful and underrated. with so many things on your child’s plate she may sacrifice sleep to cram for a math test or have a text conversation with her best friend. remind your child how much better she will feel (and how much better she will perform on that math test) if she gets the sleep her body needs. set a reasonable bedtime and try to enforce it as much as possible.	as school begins how can i help my child succeed?

no thrush is not contagious in the way a cold or the flu is. thrush is caused by a fungus (more specifically a yeast) called candida. candida is a commensal organism meaning that under healthy conditions it lives harmlessly in our bodies. we all have candida living on our skin and in our intestines and healthy women carry candida in their vaginas. when the body’s defenses are in balance candida is not noticeable or bothersome. however certain conditions can give candida the opportunity to grow excessively: a low-functioning immune system. use of topical or oral corticosteroids such as prednisone (often for asthma or autoimmune conditions). damage to the mucous membranes (the skin lining the mouth vagina and gi tract). antibiotic use. in these situations candida can grow on the skin or in the lining of the mouth gi tract or vagina. the fungus creates a white patch or plaque across the mucous membranes. in the mouth visible candida infection is called thrush. in the vagina it’s a yeast infection. in people with weakened immune systems candida can grow almost anywhere in the body. because candida is normally present in all our bodies someone with thrush can’t exactly pass it to someone else -- that person already has candida. to develop thrush a yeast infection or another candida infection that person may have one or more of the above risk factors or conditions.	is thrush contagious?

"scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. most scientists agree that there is no single cause. rather many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. genetics bipolar disorder tends to run in families so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. genes are the ""building blocks"" of heredity. they help control how the body and brain work and grow. genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. however most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness."	what are the risk factors for bipolar disorder?

unfortunately almost a third of all diabetics may be more prone to certain types of fungal infections (candidiasis) or oral thrush. many diabetics are also at a greater risk for secondary bacterial infections such as folliculitis (infection of the hair follicles) carbuncles (deep soft tissue infections) and paronychia (infections around the nail bed). many of these infections may present initially as a rash. therefore any suspected rash (on a diabetic) should be evaluated by your physician.	can diabetes lead to a rash? is it common for diabetics to get rashes?
there are several aspects to treating menstrual migraines: to treat menstrual migraine take medications after the onset. generally medications that are effective in stopping nonmenstrual migraines are effective at also treating menstrual migraines. to prevent menstrual migraine take medications just before the onset of menstruation and continue for the duration of the expected headache. taking hormones such as estrogens or estrogen-related medications also help to prevent migraine. to reduce the frequency and duration of menstrual migraine take prophylactic medications (such as beta-blockers calcium channel blockers anticonvulsants tricyclic antidepressants) that are normally used on a continuous basis to prevent nonmenstrual migraines. nsaids such as naproxen sodium (aleve) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) have been used effectively to treat menstrual migraines. a combination analgesic containing acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine (acc) can also be used to treat menstrual migraines. for women whose menstruation and menstrual migraines occur on a regular and predictable pattern nsaids may be used 24 hours before the expected onset of menstrual migraine and continued for the expected duration of the headache. since nsaids inhibit prostaglandins they have the added benefit of relieving menstrual cramps as well. triptans (naratriptan rizatriptan sumatriptan zolmitriptan) have been found to be effective in treating menstrual migraines as well as controlling the associated nausea and vomiting. sumatriptan given two to three days before and continued for the duration of the expected headache is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of menstrual migraine. naratriptan used in the same manner has also been found to be effective in preventing menstrual migraine. however in those cases where breakthrough headaches occurred they were just as severe as in patients taking placebo. dihydroergotamine (dhe) can be used as a nasal spray or given intramuscularly or intravenously to stop menstrual migraines. ergotamine (oral rectal or intranasal) and dhe (intranasal intramuscular or intravenous) can be used around the time of menstruation (several days before and continued for the duration of the expected headache) to prevent menstrual migraines. if these medications are ineffective doctors may try daily preventive medications such as beta-blockers anticonvulsants calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants to reduce the frequency and the severity of menstrual migraines. the choice of the preventive medications is based on the experiences and preferences of the doctor the medication side effects and the woman's other associated medical conditions. for women already taking preventive medications who still experience headaches the doses of preventive medications can be increased around the time of menstruation. (some doctors use preventive medications only around the time of menstruation. ) alternatively doctors may try hormone treatment. since a drop in estrogen level just prior to menstruation is the trigger for menstrual migraines estrogen replacement before menstruation has been used in preventing menstrual migraines. for some women with menstrual migraine estradiol skin patches (such as tts 50 tts 100) applied two days before menstrual migraine and continued for seven days during the expected headache period is effective. however the dose of estrogen must be closely monitored as too high of a dose can actually trigger migraine in susceptible individuals. some women with difficult-to-treat menstrual migraines may be helped by using low-dose oral contraceptives to reduce the estrogen fluctuations. other less frequently used medications for menstrual migraines include tamoxifen bromocriptine danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh).	what is the treatment for menstrual migraine?
this medication is given by injection into a large muscle as directed by your doctor. the dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. for children the dosage may also be based on weight. if you are giving this medication to yourself at home learn all preparation and usage instructions from your health care professional. before using check this product visually for particles or discoloration. if either is present do not use the liquid. learn how to store and discard medical supplies safely. antibiotics work best when the amount of medicine in your body is kept at a constant level. receive this drug at evenly spaced intervals as prescribed by your doctor and make sure not to miss any doses. continue to receive this medication until the full prescribed amount is finished even if symptoms disappear after a few days. stopping the medication too early may result in a return of the infection. tell your doctor if your condition persists or worsens.	how do i take penicillin g procaine?

i'm 18 and recovering from anorexia and bulimia. i have been at a stable weight for roughly a year and a half. when i was your age i became severely underweight and had to be admitted to an inpatient treatment center. all that you have written sounds exactly like how i felt and how i thought when i was suffering from the disease most. i would constantly research diet strategies exorcises and ways to cope with the depression that soon hit me. like you and all others that suffer from eating disorders i was obsessed. i became obsessed to drown out everything else. when i was thinking about controlling my weight i wasn't thinking about the painful things in my life. i hated the way i looked. no one had ever called me fat or teased me for the way i looked. but i was unhappy with my body because it wasn't exactly what i wanted to be. at the time there were many things in my life i could not control so i turned to controlling my body instead in addition to blocking out other painful thoughts by focusing on my eating disorder. it was very hard to recover and for a very long time i had no hope. however i promise it does get better. 16 is a very rough age. it is when you start truly becoming an adult and molding who you are. it is confusing scary and overall hard to handle. perhaps this is one reason you prefer to focus on your body and eating habits because then you do not have to focus on the other turmoil life throws at you. i cannot give you answers on how to recover but i can give you some motivation to seek help based on my experience. because i was underweight: i stopped getting my period. i still have not gotten it back. it is very likely i will never be able to have children. this may be the most devastating consequence of all. i lost almost half of my hair. it used to be beautiful and straight but now even many months after being at a stable weight it is thin wispy and unpredictable. due to lack of nutrition i still have not fully developed a woman's body. my breasts are small my hips are straight and i have little curves as a woman should have. it is very often i am mistaken for an age much younger than i actually am. i am an adult now however it is hard for people to see me as one as i look much much younger than i am. because i was sick: those around me suffered from watching me hurt myself more than i could ever understand. i was unaware at the time too engulfed in my obsession to realize their pain. my relationships have never been the same. some have simply changed in their dynamic but some are shattered beyond repair. i missed two months of school during my junior year while in treatment. some people are able to be effectively treated by a treatment team they visit a few times a week however my sickness became too severe for this type to be effective. those are two months of my teenage years i will never get back. tack on the 6 months i was severely underweight and depressed as a result of anorexia and that's nearly a year of my childhood lost to an eating disorder. much of my time today is still dedicated to recovering and fighting relapse. there are absolutely countless consequences of eating disorders. unfortunately your thoughts make it seem as though you may already be wrapped up in one. asking for help may not be what you want. it may be hard and maybe even embarrassing. however if i could tell my 16 year old self one thing it would be that help has always been hard to ask for but now than ever more important to seek. it took me months of suffering and unsuccessfully trying to recover to realize that i could not recover on my own. once i asked for help i found i had stopped feeling so helpless depressed and disheartened for i finally felt hope that i would get better. for me it took months but happiness does find a way to re-enter your life if you try to find it again. think hard not just about today but years from now as well. eating disorders put everything in your future at risk but getting help can make a world of difference.	why am i obsessed with eating disorders and losing weight? . i'm 16 and basically i hate the way i look and i hate myself for saying this but i want to be underweight. during the week i teat as little as i can and sometimes purge and also get guilty over eating a small amount but then at the weekend i tend to binge with barely any guilt. i research eating disorders and weight loss/exercise every night and it's the first thing i think of in the morning. i am obsessed with all to do with eating disorders and weight loss. why is this and what should i do?
yes it is safe but may not be necessary. i am assuming this is a urinary tract infection so a trace of blood or leukocytes may not be clinical significant now but if the medical provider determines another rocephin injection is needed it is safe.	how many doses of recephin are safe for child. my 5 year old was diagnosed with e-coli and has had 3 shots of rocephin but still has a trace of blood and leuks is it safe to give her more?
the treatment of the anemia varies greatly. first the underlying cause of the anemia should be identified and corrected. for example anemia as a result of blood loss from a stomach ulcer should begin with medications to heal the ulcer. likewise surgery is often necessary to remove a colon cancer that is causing chronic blood loss and anemia. sometimes iron supplements will also be needed to correct iron deficiency. in severe anemia blood transfusions may be necessary. vitamin b12 injections will be necessary for patients suffering from pernicious anemia or other causes of b12 deficiency. in certain patients with bone marrow disease (or bone marrow damage from chemotherapy) or patients with kidney failure epoetin alfa (procrit epogen) may be used to stimulate bone marrow red blood cell production. if a medication is thought to be the culprit then it should be discontinued under the direction of the prescribing doctor.	how is anemia treated?
a migraine is an intense throbbing typically one-sided headache. it often includes nausea vomiting sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound. the pain and symptoms from a migraine headache may be worse than the pain and symptoms of a common headache. some people have visual symptoms before the headache such as flashing lights or wavy lines called an aura. migraine attacks typically last for hours or rarely for more than a day. they can return often. the strength and frequency of migraine attacks may vary. based on your symptoms your doctor will decide whether you have migraine. migraine headaches tend to occur in members of the same family. both men and women get migraines but it is more common in women.	what is a migraine and how does it differ from other headaches?
effective chlamydia treatment requires an antibiotic -- a prescription antibiotic not something you can buy on a shelf over-the-counter. if your treatment wasn't effective you will need to see your medical provider again and re-evaluate your safe sexual practices. chlamydia requires a partner who is infected so how about using condoms?	is there anyway i can treat chylamidia without going to the doctors office? . i went once and they treated me but i don't think it was effective. i just want to be able to get rid of it without having to go to the doctors all over again. can't i just buy a pill at walmart or something?
hi if you were a virgin and had sex the first time then surely the tear is related to the membrane in the cervical region. it is followed by vaginal bleeding and this is common. if this is not the first time you had sex then this may be due to rough sex or hormonal withdrawal bleeds. a softened vaginal endometrium can also cause it. if the bleed doesnt stop till tomorow do consult a gynecologist. thanks	I had intercourse with BF, think he tore something inside me, bleeding, I’m scared?
ejaculation is composed of prostatic seminial fluid (from the prostate) and sperm. depending on your state of maturation you may not be having sufficient volumes to form an ejaculation. or you are having retrograde ejaculation (the ejaculation is going into your urinary bladder instead of out of your urethral opening). most young men of your age should be able to ejaculate but some 14 year olds are still sexually immature. this is a subject. albeit sensitive that you can discuss with your medical provider (someone who can determine your level of sexual maturation) or a urologist (a specialist in male issues). i know this may be embarrassing for you but this would really be the only way to know if you have a medical explanation or not.	i'm only 14. i feel like i have an orgasm when i masturbate but i dont ever ejaculate. is this normal?
all women can make their own decision on when or even whether they have a pelvic examination and a pap smear -- these are two very different procedures. a pelvic exam is more than just a visual inspection of the cervix and external genitalia there is a bimanual componet to feel for masses benign tumors cancers ovarian abnormalities enlarged uterus etc. the pap smear is primarily for cancer or precancerous lesions. there are no good substitutes for either one. they are not just for women at risk. periodic pelvics and pap smears are for all women. they don't have to be annual anymore. if you have a series of negative paps and do not have an genetic familial or medical risk factors they can be less often. discuss this with your gynecologist.	what alternatives are available to the regular pelvic exam for women? . i was wondering whether there is a reliable self administered test one could use to test for hpv and cancerous and precancerous cells. in addition given the relationship between hpv and cervical cancer is a pap smear even necessary if one knows they do not have cervical cancer at the moment and are not participating in any kind of sexual behavior that would expose them to the disease i. e. a change in sexual partners.

i wouldn't worry. while it is possible to get pregnant from pre-cum it is very unlikely. i would wait and see what happens. if you really are that worried then i would get a test from the dollar store instead of spending 20$ on one test that does the exact same thing as the 1$ one.	do i need a pregnancy test? . my boyfriend and i were fooling around and we had unprotected sex. i have never been pregnant before. i am 51 have pcos one ovary and my boyfriend had some trouble staying erect due to alcohol. he did not orgasm. my cycle is unpredictable and i don't know when to expect my next period. last one was 25 days ago. do i need to worry?

i'm sorry to hear about your troubles. i'm glad you made an appointment with your surgeon because that was the best action you could take. if you're not allergic to any medications you could try some over-the-counter pain relievers for this but if you're in a lot of pain i imagine you've already tried that. you can try combining acetaminophen (tylenol) with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) like ibuprofen to see if that gives you better relief. just do not exceed the maximum daily dosing of either medication. you also might try applying heat or cold or alternating the application of heat and cold. remember never to place a heating pad or ice pack directly on the skin. the usual regimen for either one is 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off. if none of that works you might call your neurosurgeon's office and ask to speak to his or her nurse or physician assistant (pa). they may be able to help you with some pain medication to manage your pain until you can be seen. good luck to you!	severe spinal pain 2 years postop. it was a football injury that resulted in a spinal hematoma around l4. it was removed and part of my vertebra. now 2 years postop i am having sudden muscle spasms and severe pain in my thoracic region severe headaches and swelling at my incision sight. my ns is not too concerned bc i can still walk and scheduled me an appointmemnt in a month but i don' know if i can take the pain that long.

hi you are not alone. believe me. there are others dealing with the same issues. i had migraines for about a month. i could not eat because then i'd throw up could not be in the light could not even go outside. each and everytime that i went outside i'd throw up. the light bothered me and made my migraines worse as well as the noise and the tv. there are good meds out there on the market for that. you just have to experience with them to see which one helps you to the most. i too saw my neurologist for my migraines. he gave me a script but it did not help very much. (those migraines are a killer). i'd cry because i could not eat or keep anything down. it did started with an aura. and mind you. i was outside waiting on the metro rail stop when this happened. i sort of had a feeling like kind of oooze. so i called my dr. and he told me to get to the nearesr er. and they told me it was migraines. and i was just constantly throwing up left and right at the er.	migraine chronic i am asking for direction to expert help as clinic/specilist that i can contact past the neurologist. i am seeing neurologist have had wide range of meds plus botox relief over 4 hours seldom maybe three times. am i alone in constant migraine do others have this lets up times not gone? is there some specialists that will try to help this ongoing hour to hour day by day pain and loss of function? pain meds only make sleep possible not life functional. i lose sight in both eyes when it is worse the eyes sag and close physically. there is aura light hurts sounds hurts cannot be social even in family
the stomach does not absorb nutrients but it does play a role enhancing absorption of certain nutrients in the small intestine. for example the stomach secretes intrinsic factor which binds to b12 for absorption in the small intestine. stomach acid turns iron into a form that is better absorbed in the small intestine. and people who have part of their stomach removed may be at risk for osteoporosis because the stomach empties faster which can decrease the amount of calcium being absorbed and utilized by the body. anyone who has surgery to remove part of the stomach should see a dietitian to be sure they are not at risk for nutrition deficiencies.	what can be absorbed by the stomach? . what percentages of various normally consumed foods and liquids can be absorbed into the body through the stomach. while i understand that the intestines absorb most of the nutrients we consume i was lead to believe that a potion of some foods and beverages were absorbed into the body through the stomach.

there is no medical explanation for this. just they way some people have big ears big feet or uneven breasts. this is just the way you are. with that said there is a relatively-simple plastic surgery procedure that can be done to shorten them back to a size that is pleasing to you. insurance companies are highly-unlikely to pay for a labial reduction but you may find it quite affordable. put it on your credit card and just go for it. lip plumping products awesome! it's spendy but i think it is well worth the price. it enhance the volume of your lips and make them more sexier than they before. <link>	why are my labia minora lips so big? i have never seen anyone with them so large. they stick out/hang down almost an inch and a half. i feel like a freak of nature. i've never seen anything like it. why am i like this? how could i be made to look normal? the older i get the worse they look.
"fraternal twins are from the fertilization and implantation of two separate ovums eggs that develop into two babies. identical twins are when one fertilized ovum splits (for whatever reason) into two and creates two genetically-identical babies. twins do ""run in familes"". so there could be an increase in the frequency of twins on either side but mostly it would be the maternal (mother's) side;"	how are twins formed? . i would like to know how identical twins and fraternal twins are formed. i would also like to know if the father being a twin affects anything. does it matter whether or not it runs in the mother's side or the father's side?

the perverse situation in states that don't expand medicaid is that it's people with lowest incomes who can't afford insurance without financial help who will be left without options. medicaid is a joint state/federal program and the law was written in a way that required states to expand their program. then the supreme court reversed that piece of the law making it optional for states and a number of governors/state legislatures chose not to expand.	what are those who live in states that didn't participate in the health exchange supposed to do for health care access? . especially when they can't afford insurance even with a subsidy and/or are unemployed. why wasn't medicaid opened nationally where those like me that still can't afford healthcare at a discounted price would still be able to get medicaid regardless of what some of our governors didn't do but should have?

stools that are gray colored may indicate problems with the drainage system involving interactions occurring between the pancreas gallbladder and liver. bile salts are normally released by the liver. if there is a liver disturbance bile production may be reduced or the release of bile can be blocked. the bile chemicals may build-up in the body and result in gray colored stools. sometimes a yellowing of the skin is also a symptom observed in conjunction with clay colored stools. digestion of the peanut butter may or may not hold any significance in the development of your change in stool color. i would recommend not waiting any longer for resolution. stools that are gray colored along with abdominal pain may be indicative of a liver infection or liver disease. anytime that stools are not brown in color is the right time to contact your doctor to have the situation correctly assessed.	a week ago tomorrow slight pain in stomach diarreah clay colored now its soild but still clay colored. concerns? . last tuesday i had ate 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. shortly after i started getting a small pain in the center of my stomach. i went to the bathroom 3 times after that. i thought maybe the peanut butter was bad. but i have had diarrhea every day since. today i have had solid stools but they are clay colored. the diarrhea was clay colored as well. could it be a virus or should i consult with my doctor?
the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis b virus are transmitted in similar ways and it is not uncommon for an individual to have both infections. persons with hiv who acquire hepatitis b are more likely to become chronically infected with hepatitis b than persons who do not have hiv. the reason for this is thought to be that hiv suppresses the immune system and impairs the ability of the body to eliminate the hepatitis b virus. some nucleoside ucleotide analogues (a class of antiretroviral drugs) are used to treat both hiv and hepatitis b although dosages may vary in the two different infections. stopping one of these agents when the hiv regimen is adjusted may cause hepatitis to flare.	what happens in co-infection with hepatitis b virus and hiv?

it depends on the laboratory running the test and any medical conditions you have. speaking roughly normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) are in the range of 0. 4 to 4. 0 miu/l. however each laboratory and test manufacturer identifies its own normal tsh range. this is based on the test the equipment being used and the patients being tested. the american association of clinical endocrinologists has proposed a range of 0. 3 to 3. 0 for normal tsh levels. using these cutoff values would lead to more people being diagnosed with an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). other experts recommend using 3. 0 as the high end of normal for people being treated for a thyroid condition. if your tsh results fall near the high or low end of normal the best way to understand them is to talk with your doctor. my tsh lev l is 1. 19 is that normal?	what are normal tsh levels?

it is not possible to offer you a number -- your statistical chances of becoming pregnant. there are just too many unknown factors to consider. i can say that the depo provera is an excellent contraceptive but not 100%. when you have unprotected intercourse you are really taking a chance with just about any contraceptive method short of sterilization (tubal ligation). could you be pregnant? yes that would be possible. you would need to see your medical provider and have a very accurate pregnancy test ordered or take a few home pregnancy tests. there can be many reasons for a woman to have sharp lower abdominal pain other than a pregnancy so you would benefit from having a hands-on examination. this is really the only way to get a sure answer. hi google depo shot side effects and when you've gone wow or some other degrading word you may come off it it can give some women some very bad side effects. put it this way i would not let my daughter go on it. good luck	chances of being pregnant after having unprotected sex within the 10th-12th week of being on the depo shot? . i first started getting the depo shot august of last year. i received a shot on september 5th. within the 10th and 12th week on that shot i had unprotected sex multiple times. then i received the shot on november 28th. recently i have been very tired all of the time. i've been sleeping half of my day awake. yesterday i woke up with a sharp pain in my lower abdomen that went away after a few minutes but felt severe. i know there have been many women pregnant on the depo before.

"most helpful answer i guess that would depend on the scope of practice for each one. many primary care providers are not that keen on providing gynecological care (assuming your ob days are over) and some ob-gyns are not crazy about handling your depression or dealing with hundreds of other non-gynecological problems that a woman might develop. if you had to pick one pick the primary care provider but consider finding one that has hospital privileges if that is important to you. many hospitals now use ""hospitalists"" that take over your case once you are admitted so not having hospital privileges may not be a big problem. talk to them both about your situation and you will see where they stand."	do i really need both ob/gyn and primary care provider at this stage in my life or could do without one. mean i currently have both but switching ob/gyns in the same practice as each other. i really like my current pcp and in which shes my prescribing doctor for my antidepressant. at the same time she doesn't have any admitting privileges at the hospital but the ob/gyn has them of course. anyway my pcp and ob/gyn are into separate offices locations from each other. the ob/gyn's office location is pretty much nearer my house then pcp.
the life cycle of the malaria parasite ( plasmodium ) is complicated and involves two hosts humans and anopheles mosquitoes. the disease is transmitted to humans when an infected anopheles mosquito bites a person and injects the malaria parasites (sporozoites) into the blood. sporozoites travel through the bloodstream to the liver mature and eventually infect the human red blood cells. while in red blood cells the parasites again develop until a mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected human and ingests human red blood cells containing the parasites. then the parasites reach the anopheles mosquito's stomach and eventually invade the mosquito salivary glands. when an anopheles mosquito bites a human these sporozoites complete and repeat the complex plasmodium life cycle. p. ovale and p. vivax can further complicate the cycle by producing dormant stages (hypnozoites) that may not develop for weeks to years.	how is malaria transmitted?

the bartholin glands or ducts are located at either side of the vaginal opening. they secrete a lubricating fluid. occasionally the opening of the gland will become blocked causing a back-up or accumulation of fluid. this is called a bartholin duct cyst. this is the most common cystic growth in the vulva. sometimes the blockage is the result of an infection such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. the accumulated fluid can become infected as well. at this point it is called a bartholin gland abscess. a bartholin gland abscess can be very painful and requires treatment. the most common treatment is an incision with drainage and antibiotics. usually a wood catheter is placed in the gland to allow continued drainage and a larger opening to the gland to form. this catheter is a short tube with a little balloon on one end and is usually left in place for 1-2 weeks. for recurrent cysts or abscesses a procedure called a marsupialization is performed. the gland is surgically opened and then sutured open so that it does not reform. you should discuss with your doctor if you are a candidate for this procedure.	recurring bartholin gland cyst/abcess please help! . . my first one started 8 years ago when i was pregnant with my sonthe doctor lanced and drained it. since june of this year it has been coming back this is the 5th one since june i have one currently and i am 4 months pregnant i had one in june after 4 agonizing days it tore and drained 1 in september that had done the same 2 in october the first 1 in october i had surgery for lancing and draining again and the second 1 came about 2 weeks after and now this is my second 1 in november. please help
does your child have trouble sitting still? does he or she have trouble focusing and completing a task? you may be wondering if your child has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). for starters a diagnosis of adhd is based on a combination of inattentive impulsive and hyperactive behaviors that are inappropriate for the age of the child. and most of the time adhd is not diagnosed until a child enters school. why? because virtually all preschoolers have trouble paying attention and sitting still! so don’t book a consultation with your child’s doctor because your preschooler doesn’t want to sit around during storytime. here’s what you need to know about adhd: q. is adhd hereditary? yes. interestingly add [attention deficit disorder] and adhd tends to run in families. often a parent realizes he or she has the disorder when his or her child is going through the evaluation process. q. what signs should i be looking for in my child? * hyperactivity: a child will constantly fidget with his hands or body. he may seem like he is always on the go. he may have trouble sitting in his seat or playing quietly. and he may talk incessantly. * impulsivity: a child will have trouble taking turns in play. he may blurt out answers in the classroom or interrupt other children’s activities. as a result he may be rejected by his peers. * inattention: a child may be very disorganized and have trouble completing tasks even ones that are fun. he may be forgetful and gloss over details. q. what is the difference between add and adhd? the “h” stands for hyperactivity. kids with add are not fidgety or loud and so they have fewer behavior problems in the classroom. thus they often are diagnosed later — often a child will be eight or nine before add kids are identified. q. if i am worried about add/adhd who should i turn to for help? start with your child’s teacher. he or she can fill out a checklist that demonstrates your child’s successes and challenges in a classroom setting. you will also be asked to do an assessment of your child in your home setting as well. the next step is to discuss the finding with your child’s doctor. the doctor may conduct the complete evaluation and treatment process himself or he may refer your child for additional evaluations and potentially treatment with a specialist. yes. my child is in 7th grade this year we have never had issues with grades or her not keeping up with assignments. she is never still she talks consistently she has been having problems sleeping. she will lay in bed for hours before falling asleep. we have tried different things to help her settle down at night but still no improvement. her grades have fallen really low. her sister has adhd who is 16 years old is on medication. once we started her on meds her whole life became better. i have always suspected my 7th grader having it also but have tried to handle it with the same modifications we did with our 16 yr old. i am not sure where to start with her the doctor we used for testing with our oldest is no longer here in our town. my main concern is the lack of sleep she is getting. also she is always being told to calm down and that she does not always have to be talking. does it sound like i should get her tested? yes	does my child have adhd?
hello. from your description here it seems you are troubled with the anger issues more than anything else. and the recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking 'during' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for the purpose of providing medical information and is not a substitute for a face-to-face consultation with a doctor. this post is not intended to give or rule out a diagnosis create a doctor-patient relationship or replace an existing one. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment options)	i constantly have bursts of anger for no reason once it's over i usually wish i wouldn't have done it and go from being absolutely angry and freaking out to completely calm. my father is the same way i have constant anxiety and i'm almost never completely happy about something. my moods are all over the place but the most dominating and often reoccurring is anger i literally wake up in the morning angry for no reason. i was never like this before i hit about 14 i just turned 21 and it seems to be getting increasingly worse. it just feels like i'm someone else completely when it's happening an i just don't feel like i can stop no matter who i'm taking it out on then i snap out of it after it finally exhaust's me and it's just almost like it was a different person acting that way. i don't have the money to go to the doctor and i don't have insurance. i feel like i can't handle this emotional roller-coaster anymore. does this classify under bipolar and if so what type?

the short answers are: yes and yes. if a person with an active cold sore performs oral sex on his or her partner the partner can develop genital herpes. a cold sore is caused by the herpes simplex (hsv-1) virus and genital herpes are caused by a related virus herpes simplex (hsv-2). if you're concerned about whether or not you have contracted hsv-2 from sexual contact with your partner your health care provider can have you take a blood test to determine if you have either hsv-1 or hsv-2. always remember to practice safe sex. a condom may not offer complete protection against genital herpes because the lesions associated with this condition may occur on skin outside the area covered by the condom. for this reason you shouldn't have sex with anyone who is having an active outbreak of either genital or oral herpes. i wish you all the best!	can a person contract genital herpes from a person with a cold sore. and is there a test one can take to know if u have.
as a matter of fact yes it can. low blood sugar definitely can make people hallucinate and do strange erratic things. however blood sugar has to be severely low to create bad dreams or hallucinations. anyone who has diabetes (or anyone with a family member who has diabetes) should be aware of the signs of low blood sugar. when a person has diabetes the focus tends to be on keeping blood sugar numbers down. but low blood sugar is a serious and even deadly possibly complication of diabetes. early signs of low blood sugar include: confusion shakiness weakness fainting hunger racing pulse anxiety and many others if you suspect low blood sugar and can take a blood glucose reading do so right away. if a person's blood sugar has fallen below 70 mg/dl give the person a small amount of sugar. monitor the individual carefully to ensure s/he doesn't develop signs of even lower blood sugar such as poor coordination and numbness of the mouth/tongue. if those symptoms occur call for emergency medical responders. otherwise take another blood glucose reading in an hour or so to make sure the level has risen above 70. if you have diabetes with frequent episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) see your doctor to learn how to control your diabetes better. wishing you well!	can low blood sugar make u halucinate

it’s complicated. it depends on what type of coverage you have now how much you earn and your age and sex. if you have coverage through a large employer you probably won’t see major changes. however the requirements for large employers are still being sorted out. if you buy insurance on your own in the so-called “individual market” and qualify for premium subsidies based on your income (see <link> ) then your premiums will probably decrease. if you do not qualify for subsidies and are younger or are a male your premiums will probably increase. the reason is that the health reform law limits the ability of insurers to charge higher premiums to older consumers and females. to make up for these lost revenues insurers will increase premiums for other types of consumers. for employees of small firms the situation is more complicated. the federal government will subsidize coverage for workers in firms with fewer than 25 employees. firms with fewer than 100 employees can buy insurance through the exchange (or marketplace). firms may pass some of the savings on to employees in the form of lower premiums. some small employers will offer more generous health insurance plans to comply with the requirements of the health law. premiums will probably increase for workers in these firms. higher income medicare beneficiaries may see their premiums increase under health reform.	will my premiums go up? i have heard that they will more than double under health reform.

"strategies for fighting diabetes are pretty much the same as the strategies for fighting diabetic kidney disease. doctors and patients try to keep the blood sugar levels and blood pressure levels in excellent control because high glucose and/or blood pressure can accelerate the damage. an eating and exercise strategy designed to reverse the diabetes as much as possible is a top priority for slowing the kidney damage. this would involve losing as much excess body fat as possible and keeping your muscles heart and lungs in shape via cardio and resistance exercise. there are many good eating strategies. avoiding excess starch sugar and animal fat are the top priorities in my view. avoiding excess salt and protein may also slow the kidney disease. . a good way to follow the kidney disease progression or slowing is via the urine protein levels as well as the ""glomerular filtration rate"" (gfr) test."	i am a type 2 diabetic and my kidneys are in the beginning stages of breakdown. how can i slow that process?
use a condom for goodness sake! stop playing sexual roulette with your girlfriend. you may be fine this time. i don't know. but it is only a matter of time before she will become pregnant. maybe next time. viable sperm can be present in seminal fluid and that sperm can remain alive for a week or so. while a woman can only become pregnant a few days a month sperm do not understand that. many will just wait around hoping that an egg (ovum) will appear. you will sleep better if you keep all of your penile emissions. the seminal fluid and your ejaculations well-contained in a condom. and since you and your girlfriend are clearly having regular sex she could benefit from using an effective form of contraception as well. the short answer is yes and no. yes she can get pregnant from pre-cum and no she cannot get pregnant the day or two after her period ends. the long answer is as follows: using a condom and/or birth control will help keep your minds at ease and are likely your best method for not having an unwanted baby. most health departments will offer both at little to no cost. if it is true that her period ended on friday then it is highly unlikely that she will become pregnant day after pill or not. sperm can live for 24-72 hours in the female body. most will die off en-route searching for an egg however it only takes one egg and one sperm. a woman's cycle works like this. period starts and triggers a turn of events. the lh phase is the phase when her body is not fertile typically 10-16 days from the day the period starts depending on her specific cycle. then the fertile days come in to play. for about 4-5 days her body will be in a fertile state but typically it is the last two days of this particular cycle when she is most ready to get pregnant. once this phase is over her body prepares to have another period to shed the lining that has built up to accept the pregnancy. i would suggest getting an app on her phone that tracks her cycle and her most fertile times of the month. mostly because i don't see you two using a condom or birth control no matter how many people tell you that you should. at least this way you two will have a better understanding of where her body is at and when its at that point to try and keep from getting pregnant. it can take about three months to get the app lined up with her cycle to track the days with the most accuracy. please keep in mind that this is for a woman with a 'normal' cycle however even with an abnormal cycle it is highly unlikely to get pregnant within a few days of ending a period. this information comes from personal experience with tracking my own cycle to achieve pregnancy which i have done successfully. best of luck to you both! i would say you can be 99. 9% certain that she will not get pregnant. you guys may want to consider a better form of birth control however!	can a girl get pregnant from precum the day after her period then taking the morning after pill. i had sex with my gf twice this weekend. once on sat night and once sun morning. i did not use a condom nor did i cum inside of her. she just got off her period the day before we had sex. i was worried so i had her take the morning after pill. she also took the morning after pill last month for the same incident. should she be ok not getting pregnant since i didnt cum inside her and she took the pill?

"because women over age 35 are more likely to have certain problems during pregnancy the following tests may be recommended. these tests can help detect disorders before during and after your pregnancy. some of these tests require appropriate genetic counseling including a detailed discussion regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure(s). whether you choose to have the tests is up to you. talk to your health care provider to find out if any of these tests are right for you. ultrasound: a test in which high-frequency sound waves are used to produce an image of your baby. ultrasound is used early in pregnancy to determine viability (if the baby is in the uterus and if the baby's heart is beating) the presence of more than one fetus and to determine your baby's due date or gestational age (the age of the fetus). later in pregnancy ultrasound may be used to see how the baby is doing to determine placenta location and the amount of amniotic fluid around the baby. quad marker screen: a blood test in which substances in the blood sample are measured to screen for problems in the development of the fetus' brain spinal cord and other neural tissues of the central nervous system (neural tube) such as spina bifida or anencephaly. neural tube defects occur in 1 or 2 out of every 1 000 births. the quad marker screen can detect approximately 75% to 80% of open neural tube defects. the quad marker screen can also detect genetic disorders such as down syndrome a chromosomal abnormality. the quad marker screen can detect approximately 75% of down syndrome cases in women under age 35 and over 80% of down syndrome cases in women age 35 years and older. it is important to note that a ""positive” result from this blood test is not definitive for a birth defect. usually the next step is to offer the mother an amniocentesis to evaluate the baby’s chromosomes as well as an ultrasound to evaluate the baby’s body for signs of birth defects. the quad marker screen may be performed between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. first trimester screen: a newer test done between weeks 10 to 14 detects the presence of two markers in a blood sample in conjunction with an ultrasound to measure the thickness of the back of the fetus' neck. it tests for chromosomal abnormalities like down syndrome. it is essentially as accurate as the quad marker screen but results can be obtained earlier in the pregnancy. amniocentesis: amniocentesis also called an amnio is a procedure in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is removed from the sac surrounding the fetus and tested for birth defects. while it does not detect all birth defects it can be used to detect sickle cell disease cystic fibrosis muscular dystrophy tay-sachs disease or down syndrome if the parents have a significant genetic risk. amniocentesis can also detect certain neural tube defects (where the spinal cord or brain don't develop normally) such as spina bifida and anencephaly. because ultrasound is performed at the time of amniocentesis it may detect birth defects that are not detected by amniocentesis (such as cleft palate cleft lip club foot or heart defects). there are some birth defects however that will not be detected by either amniocentesis or ultrasound. chorionic villus sampling (cvs): a test in which a small sample of cells (called chorionic villi) is taken from the placenta where it attaches to the wall of the uterus. chorionic villi are tiny parts of the placenta that are formed from the fertilized egg so they have the same genes as the fetus. if you have certain risk factors you may be offered cvs as a way to detect birth defects during early pregnancy. cvs requires appropriate genetic counseling including a detailed discussion regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure."	what types of prenatal tests should i have if i become pregnant after age 35?

"well it's a good question. motivation is the challenge of every person who wants to achieve a goal be it weight loss becoming an oil painter or anything else. it sounds like you may have invested too much time and effort into research. everything feels overwhelming to you right now doesn't it? don't let that stop you. at a certain point you have to take the plunge and do it. stop thinking about it and just do it. i read an interesting article in which a fitness coach said there is no such thing as ""motivation;"" there are only choices. you can choose to eat an apple or you can choose to eat a candy bar. you can choose to take a walk for 10 minutes or you can choose to watch tv instead. do you see the difference here? i strongly suggest you and your friend check out webmd's diet community where you can share your fears struggles goals and successes with others who will cheer you on! you are not the first person to fear getting started on the path to a healthy life and you won't be the last. meanwhile choose goals you know you can easily accomplish. for example: today i will eat one apple instead of a candy bar today i will throw away all the junk food in my house today i will walk for 10 minutes this week i will walk for 10 minutes every day i mean come on! anyone can do 10 minutes of exercise right? of course you can! lastly don't forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals no matter how small they may be. don't use food as a reward. even if you accomplish just one thing today download a new song to your smartphone take a bubble bath or do something else to celebrate the fact that today at least you won. you don't need ""motivation.

there are two possibilities. first you may have completely packed your wax-filled ear against the eardrum. in this case your eardrum cannot move and thus your hearing would be diminished. second you may have ruptured your eardrum or at the very least caused trauma to the eardrum (even if you did not see any blood). for a wax impaction a warm water lavage would likely remove the packed wax however if the integrity of your eardrum has been disrupted (requires an otoscopic exam by a medical professional) washing out your ear would be contraindicated. an ent or a trained professional would need to carefully remove the wax impaction stop using q-tips! they are dangerous and earwax is not dirt. it is a beneficial protective coating for the ear canal.	i can't hear much out of my left ear after going to deep with q-tip doesn't hurt though. any suggestions to hear again. i heard a popping cracking noise before and i decided to clean my ear out. the next day it felt like swimmer's ear sort of fluid in there so i cleaned again and it felt like i went in too deep. to make clear i have no pain i just cannot hear fully out of my left ear. i have tried the ear-wax softener three times and have had no luck.

hi this is from the uk's nhs. pain and swelling of the testicles (orchitis) affects one in four males who get mumps after puberty. the swelling is usually sudden and affects only one testicle. the testicle may also feel warm and tender. in affected boys and men swelling of their testicles normally begins four to eight days after the swelling of the parotid gland. occasionally swelling can occur up to six weeks after the swelling of the glands. any testicle pain can be eased using over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. if the pain is particularly severe contact your gp who may prescribe a stronger painkiller for you. applying cold or warm compresses to your testicles and wearing supportive underwear may also reduce any pain. just under half of all males who get mumps-related orchitis will notice some shrinkage of their testicles and an estimated 1 in 10 men will experience a drop in their sperm count (the amount of healthy sperm that their body can produce). however this is very rarely large enough to cause infertility. so as you can see you should still be fertile have you had a sperm test done? is your divorce because of this problem? there ways to retrieve sperm even its a very small amount with this she could have ivf that's if you have the money for this. did see a japanese guy the were only able to retrieve 7 sperms and that did the trick had twins i believe see so it can be done. do hope this helps you. good luck	small testes after mumps orchitis. my testes have shrunk badly since i had mumps orchitis my life is badly disturbed about to be divorced what are possible treatments to get my fertility back.
hi found you this answer on med help its from dr j m epp phd hi. here are the answers to your questions: 1. sperm cannot survive in hot water. however they can survive in cold or warm water for a few minutes. 2. they die very quickly once they get dry in the air are exposed to cleaning chemicals or change temperature too much. that means that when semen dries out the sperm inside are probably dead. according to the mayo clinic sperm in semen exposed to the open air will usually die within a few hours. you can also kill sperm on your hands clothes or bedding by washing them in soap and water. if you have semen on your body and need a quick clean up you can simply wipe it up with baby wipe or tissue so that the remaining semen dries quickly. the rest will probably dry in the trash long before you take out the garbage. please note that soap water or air are not effective forms of birth control if semen has gotten in or on your partner's genitals! i'm just talking about sperm that is outside the body. if there are diseases in the semen they may be more resilient depending on the disease. hopefully this information will put you at ease about the longevity of your delicate little swimmers. 3. washing your hands with very hot water and soap will kill sperm as long as you can be sure you've reached every tiny nook and cranny of your hands. a much more effective form of risk reduction is to use a barrier method such as latex. 4. varicose veins do not impair sperm production. 5. sperm begin to die on contact with air; however there are millions and millions in each ejaculation. take a drop of semen and put it on a piece of paper. as the semen dries out the sperm are dying. once the semen is totally dry the semen are all dead. that's the amount of time it takes for them all to die. the smaller the drop the quicker they're dead. dr. j do hope this helps you calm your nerves. good luck	if guy ejaculates on toilet and doesnt flush and min later girl pees water splashes on her vulva can she get pregnant? . a family member tends to never flush and i think he masturbates there. a couple of days ago i rushed to the restroom without checking if it was flushed and water splashed on my vulva. is there a chance of pregnancy? i don't know how long after i used the restroom but the toilet tab was opened so i am guessing the water was cold and there was air around. i am very worried since it was in my fertile days and i am not down for incest.

we are learning more and more each day about drug interactions with food especially juices like grapefruit. grapefruit juice has the ability to interact with certain enzymes in the body – the same enzymes that help break down medicines like statins so your body can use them. this can lead to high levels of the drug in the body and lead to a variety of health problems. it is best to avoid grapefruit while on this class of medications. you can also talk to your doctor or health care provider to see if you can be switched to a different class of medications for your cholesterol; we have a few other options besides statins. if you have any questions about drug/food interactions talk to your pharmacist. we are happy to help.	can i ever have grapefruit again if i take a statin?

the best way to protect your bones while losing weight is to exercise regularly and eat healthy foods. however what if you don’t want to take the slow but sure route to weight loss? “[if you are] crash dieting for a few weeks for your wedding or some other big event there probably won’t be any major impact -- although i would always advise making sure you get adequate calcium and vitamin d during that time period ” says felicia cosman md medical director of the clinical research center at helen hayes hospital in haverstraw n. y. and an editor of osteoporosis: an evidence-based guide to prevention and management. but long-term “crash” dieting can have an impact on your bone health cosman says. “if you go for six months or so eating 800 or 900 calories a day that’s likely to be bad for your bones. i would say that a threshold of at least 1 200 calories per day is about what’s needed to maintain your bones and tissues. if your caloric intake is significantly below that for an extended period of time you’re probably doing damage. ”	do weight loss diets put you at risk for osteoporosis?

in babies umbilical hernias may heal themselves within four years making surgery unnecessary. for all others the standard treatment is conventional hernia-repair surgery (called herniorrhaphy). it is possible to simply live with a hernia and monitor it. the main risk of this approach is that the protruding organ may become strangulated (have its blood supply cut off) and infection and tissue death may occur as a result. a strangulated intestinal hernia may result in intestinal obstruction causing the abdomen to swell. the strangulation can also lead to infection gangrene intestinal perforation shock or even death.	what are the treatments for a hernia?

the question should i nap it really depends. if you have a problem falling asleep at night the answer is no. there is data to suggest that the last time you were asleep is directly proportional to how long it takes you to fall asleep. so if the last time you were asleep was at 2:30 this afternoon you’re probably going to have a pretty tough time falling asleep if you have insomnia as opposed to if it was 6:30 this morning. so if you’re an insomniac or you’re someone who has a hard time falling asleep i think napping is out. however if you’re sleep deprived and socially speaking you can only get 6 and a half hours sleep but you really need 7 and a half then a nap during the day may be just the thing for you.	should i nap?

"of course you may be serviced at an urgent care clinic but i don't see that as being your best choice. urgent care center doctors see individuals for relatively uncomplicated matters that can be resolved in one visit. conditions such as colds viruses rashes minor injuries bruises cuts requiring stiches and infections are typical types of straight forward easily diagnosable cases that respond well to immediate treatment. a migraine headache is a symptom of some other disorder within the body such as hormonal changes head/neck injury alcohol consumption sexual activity eye conditions ears nose & throat disorders emotional stress ingesting certain foods and beverages environmental factors such as breathing polluted air and many other reasons. there is also a relationship between family heredity as a predisposing factor seen in suffers with migraines. i recommend that you begin your search for resolution by making an appointment with a migraine headache specialist. other doctors who may provide you with answers to your headaches include: neurologists pain management specialists ob/gyn specialists endocrinologists and allergy specialists. the next task is to begin keeping a journal of all daily activates. it should include times dates all physical and emotional events all foods and beverages consumed and of course headaches. note the start and end times for all headaches the quality of the headache (what does it feel like? ) your pain level (1 - 10) treatments attempted and your response to those treatments. if the headaches cannot be reduced in their number of episodes or their intensity in a reasonable amount of time then going to a hospital emergency room or urgent care center is justified. in the interim take the medications as instructed maintain a quiet and dark environment during acute headache periods apply a facial ice pack/and or heat to the painful areas eat and drink nutritious meals and rest as needed. unfortunately migraine headaches are painful and may be difficult to diagnosis in the differential process of identifying the precipitating factors known (""triggers"") which are unique to the individual sufferer of a migraine headache. feel better soon."	i have had a migraine for over 48 hours. my doctor just wants to give me medicine should i get a second oppinion? . i took excedrin when the migraine started but that didn't work. i slept. that didn't work. i went to the doctor they gave me a shot of ketorolac tromethamine. that didn't work. i went to the chiropractor and had my neck adjusted and massaged. that didn't work. i took rizatriptan. that didn't work. the doctor said not to bother to come in unless it persist to next week and then they will give me more medicine. my chiropractor recommended going to urgent care. i don't know what to do.
"from what you're describing it sounds highly unlikely you could be pregnant. but i never say never when it comes to pregnancy. if your partner wore a condom throughout this encounter did not penetrate you and ejaculated into the condom then i'd say the odds of pregnancy are slim to none. if your partner did penetrate you prior to pulling out and putting on a condom that's an entirely different story because any seminal fluid (including ""pre-cum"") can contain sperm which can in turn fertilize an egg if they find one. there's no need to take a pregnancy test unless you have actually missed your period (by which i mean it's at least a week late). i realize some home pregnancy test kits say they work even before a missed period but those are not necessarily the most accurate tests. to obtain an accurate result wait until you've missed the start of your period then take a home pregnancy test first thing in the morning when your urine is the most concentrated. be very careful with the timing. if you follow all the package instructions the results should be quite accurate. wishing you all the best!"	could i be pregnant without penetration? . -i was on day 9 of my cycle. -my partner was wearing a condom. -he was near the vaginal opening but did not penetrate. -he was rubbing his penis on the clitoris. -when he ejaculated he moved away from my genitals. -i took a pregnancy test on day 27 of my cycle during the morning and it said negative. -i am extremely stressed over this situation
if you don’t sleep your brain doesn’t have the time it needs to really get rid of all of the garbage of the day and to really have that ability to rejuvenate. you have to give some things a little bit of a rest. your heart you can’t stop it. it has to keep beating alright but your brain needs that period of time rest and recuperation. your body needs it. if you can’t sleep and you can’t help yourself sleep by doing a little bit of guided imagery or some relaxation breathing or whatever then you need to consider to go and maybe get some short term sleep medication. i’m a firm believer in that. i don’t think people should become addicted to sleep medications and i think that there are a lot of fine ones on the market today that will help you sleep. so i would say you have to sleep. it’s your job. i tell some people you know what turn everything off because right now the most important job you have is to go to sleep and you can allow yourself to sleep. whatever you need and i don’t recommend alcohol. i know some people do that whatever you need that is going to help you sleep. they call it sleep hygiene. that means you do not do exercise two hours before you go to sleep. it’s too energizing okay. you sleep in a room that is dark enough quiet enough comfortable enough that you can go off to sleep. this is your time. you’re not cheating. when i hear people say oh i operate on two or three hours of sleep i say no no you are doing what the national commission on sleep has says which is you are building up a sleep debt and it is going to come to get you so don’t do that to yourself.	what is the role of sleep in stress?

people who choose not to buy health insurance will be charged a penalty of just $95 or 1% of their annual income whichever is higher in 2014. that penalty grows over time. a big concern is that in order to save money people will decide to pay the penalty instead of purchasing coverage and simply wait until they become sick to sign onto a health plan. if that’s your plan you may want to reconsider. open enrollment periods will be set up to discourage people from doing this. in year one for example. in most states you’ll be able to buy insurance through your state’s new marketplace beginning october 1 2013 through march 31 2014. if you don’t sign up for insurance you’ll be locked out of the market until the following year. if you become sick during that time you’ll be left to pay for your medical care on your own.	what if i don't buy health insurance? can't i just pay the penalty and sign up for insurance if i need it?

transient ischemic attack therapy treatment for a transient ischemic attack is aimed at preventing a second stroke. since there is no way of determining the severity of future episodes and no guarantee that the symptoms will resolve prevention of a future tia or a stroke is crucial. treatment guidelines address a variety of targeted goals. antiplatelet therapy if the patient was not taking aspirin when the tia occurred it needs to be started (325 mg per day). if the patient was taking aspirin then another antiplatelet drug called dipyridamole needs to be added. aggrenox is a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. if the patient cannot tolerate aspirin then clopidogrel (plavix) should be used. high blood pressure therapy even if the patient does not have hypertension or high blood pressure there may be benefit in taking antihypertensive medications. two classes of drugs are recommended to be started at the same time a diuretic and an ace inhibitor. the goal for normal blood pressure is 120/80. cholesterol lowering therapy guidelines recommend that a statin drug be started even if cholesterol levels are normal. risk modification smoking excessive alcohol obesity and lack of physical activity are considered risks for future stroke. the following recommendations are now suggested: smoking: counseling smoking cessation aids like nicotine gum or medications like varenicline (chantix) should be considered. environmental smoke should be avoided. alcohol: intake should be limited to two or fewer drinks a day for men and one or less for women. obesity: overweight people should try to lose weight using a combination of diet exercise and counseling. the goal is a bmi of 18. 5-24. 9 and a waistline of 35 inches or less for women and 40 inches or less for men. exercise: 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily is recommended for those who are able. for patients with disabilities a tailored exercise program to their capabilities should be arranged.	what is the treatment for a transient ischemic attack or tia?

maybe. the herpes virus can remain viable on wet or damp surfaces for quite a while. to get it this way a person would (a) have to be particularly vulnerable to getting herpes and (b) have a fresh contact -- someone with a very active herpetic lesion perhaps on their buttocks. in the vast majority of cases herpes is spread the good ;ol fashioned way.	can herpes be spead through sharing a towel or toilet?
yes. smoking increases mucus production and impairs the clearing action of the cilia in the airway. also the addition of bacteria inflammatory cells and damaged lung cells to the secretions in the airway and lung make the secretions especially thick tenacious and difficult to clear. therefore in such a stagnant and nutritious (the mucus) environment bacteria can flourish and cause infection of the lung (pneumonia). furthermore even the inflammatory cells are damaged by tobacco smoke so that their ability to fight infection is diminished. for all of these reasons pneumonia is not only more common but it is often also more severe in smokers with copd (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis) than in non-smokers without copd. moreover the inflammatory cells that accumulate in the lung to fight off the infection can fill the alveolar spaces and thereby further limit diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. therefore smokers with copd who already have impaired breathing (pulmonary function) often become much worse when there is a superimposed infection of the lung (pneumonia).	are smokers with copd predisposed to developing pneumonia?

parents are relegated to determine if a child has a possible ear infection based solely on symptoms and signs [unless they have a home otoscope a tool that allows a look inside the ear and know how to use it]. those of us in the clinical trenches know that symptoms and signs are not necessarily predictive of a definitive diagnosis. a recent two-year study in finland looked at 469 children ages 6-35 months and tested the predictive value of common middle ear infection symptoms: ear-rubbing or pulling irritability less playful excessive crying poor appetite restless sleep runny nose congestion vomiting diarrhea and fever. the diagnosis of a middle ear infection (otitis media) requires a certain diagnostic criteria: middle ear fluid detected by pneumatic otoscopy — this is the little bulb syringe attached to the otoscope that puffs air against the eardrum to check for mobility (the normal in and out movement of the eardrum). abnormal color opacity bulging (shape) of the eardrum. middle ear infections are typically “bulging” and have a distinct red or yellow color instead of shiny white. in this study not one but three different physicians systematically examined the ears of children strongly suspected by the parents as having a middle ear infection based on symptoms alone. the results: the duration and severity of the symptoms were not predictive of a middle ear infection. ear-rubbing and pulling long thought to be predictive of ear pain was proven to be an invalid sign. it was actually more common in children who did not have a middle ear infection. fever was also not a predictive sign. a prior cold was not a predictive sign in this study although statistically most children who get middle ear infection usually do have a cold. conjunctivitis (pink eye) may be a presumptive sign in some not all cases. the only definitive way to diagnose a child with a middle ear infection is by a careful systematic medical examination by an experienced clinician using a pneumatic otoscope. i see these false alarms nearly every day in my clinical practice. parents believe their children have an ear infection when in reality they do not. many parents will still demand antibiotics “just in case ” or come up with some compelling stories like going out of town tomorrow a seriously ill grandparent or upcoming air travel in an effort to plead their case. cursory or incomplete examinations by hurried clinicians tend to over-read ear examination findings resulting in inaccurate diagnoses. i find this quite often in emergency room or urgent care visits. here are 10 facts about ear infection: 1. not all middle ear infections in children (not including babies under the age of three months) require antibiotics. as a matter of fact over 90 percent of middle ear infections will self-resolve in a few days… on their own without any medical intervention. shocking. it is perfectly fine to wait a few days to see if the body’s immune system orchestrates the cure. 2. middle ear infections hurt. regardless of the presence of fever (harmless) a child in pain should be treated with acetaminophen (tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) at an appropriate dose for the pain… not the fever. 3. fever is harmless and does not need to be treated in most cases. 4. middle ear infections are not emergencies. they really have no place in the emergency room. 5. not all recurrent ear infection will result in children getting tubes. however if middle ear fluid is present for more than three months and/or children are having hearing loss an ent specialist should be consulted. 6. children in daycare get more ear infections. the fall and winter months have the highest incidence. 7. children exposed to any secondary cigarette smoke get more ear infections. (if you smoke around your children you should be arrested. ) 8. children who are breast-fed for at least six months get less ear infections that bottle-fed babies. 9. children who have a nighttime bottle in the crib or depend on a pacifier tend to have more ear infections. 10. children do grow out of ear infections. we see a marked reduction after age six so hang in there. now go buy a home otoscope and start practicing.	what are the symptoms and signs of an ear infection in children?
baby acne (small bumps) on the face head and chest is common from about 1 to 4 months. if the baby is not bothered by the rash use plain water when bathing and it will soon go away. check with your doctor for the best treatment (if any) for your baby since there are many different kinds of rashes.	my two-month-old has a skin rash with peeling and little bumps. what can i do?
most women find the second trimester of pregnancy easier than the first. but it is just as important to stay informed about your pregnancy during these months. you might notice that symptoms like nausea and fatigue are going away. but other new more noticeable changes to your body are now happening. your abdomen will expand as the baby continues to grow. and before this trimester is over you will feel your baby beginning to move! as your body changes to make room for your growing baby you may have: body aches such as back abdomen groin or thigh pain. stretch marks on your abdomen breasts thighs or buttocks. darkening of the skin around your nipples. a line on the skin running from belly button to pubic hairline. patches of darker skin usually over the cheeks forehead nose or upper lip. patches often match on both sides of the face. this is sometimes called the mask of pregnancy. numb or tingling hands called carpal tunnel syndrome. itching on the abdomen palms and soles of the feet. (call your doctor if you have nausea loss of appetite vomiting jaundice or fatigue combined with itching. these can be signs of a serious liver problem. ) swelling of the ankles fingers and face. (if you notice any sudden or extreme swelling or if you gain a lot of weight really quickly call your doctor right away. this could be a sign of preeclampsia. )	what is the second trimester (week 13 to week 2<positive_smiley> of pregnancy?

i'm sorry you're going through this. pain is never fun! i would urge you to get in to see your doctor as soon as possible. what you're describing does not sound like a migraine at all but it could possibly be an ear infection. in rare cases an untreated ear infection can move into the bone behind the ear. this normally happens in children and is called mastoiditis. no matter what the underlying cause of this pain is the fact it's ongoing and seems to be getting worse means you need medical attention. if you can't get an office visit it's probably time for a visit to urgent care. feel better!	i am having a severe migraine that wont go away and now i am having severe pain behind both ears in the bone. i had a severe migraine and after 11 days i went to the er to get relief. the pain did subside and a day and a half later it came back along with severe pain in the bone behind my ear and now both ears. i am having alot of trouble sleeping. nothing is helping the ear pain. the pain now going down my neck. its now been 4 days since i was in the er. i do have migraines and hemiplegic migraines. i have never had this pain before. i am having trouble getting ahold of my dr.

"i’m not sure what you mean by ""suddenly"". but it’s unfortunately common for cholesterol levels to rise as we age particularly if you have a family history of high cholesterol. in addition certain medications and medical conditions such as thyroid problems are associated with a rise in cholesterol. so make sure to check in with your doctor about rising cholesterol levels. if everything checks out fine then be sure to take a very close look at what you’re eating. cut back on saturated fat and cholesterol intake. losing weight if needed will also typically drop cholesterol levels. exercise also helps. if all else fails talk to your doctor about medication for lowering cholesterol."	why would my cholesterol level suddenly be elevated if i have not changed my diet in any way?

epilepsy may develop even though you do not have any risk factors. a cause cannot always be identified. this is especially true in many forms of childhood epilepsy. for some people epilepsy can result from a tumor infection or damage to the brain. children and older adults are most likely to develop epilepsy but it can start at any age. it is possible that epilepsy may run in families but you do not have to have a family history to develop epilepsy. epileptic seizures occur when abnormal bursts of electricity in the brain briefly upset normal brain function. it's not always clear what triggers the bursts of abnormal electrical activity. conditions that can cause seizures include: head injury. stroke or conditions that affect the blood vessels (vascular system) in the brain. hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) in the brain. brain tumor. brain infection such as meningitis or encephalitis. alzheimer's disease. alcohol or drug abuse or withdrawal. tumors scar tissue from injury or disease or abnormal brain development may damage a specific area of the brain and cause partial seizures. but you may not have any of these conditions and still develop epilepsy. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes epilepsy?
your mother's test results show abnormalities. that is why the doctor has recommended cag (coronary angiography). the ecg shows st segment flattening at v which indicates ischemia (reduced blood supply) and can lead to a heart attack. it can occur in patients without chest pain. the choice for the type of angiography should be made by the attending physician. he or she will be in the correct position to decide the best for her based on his experience. there is nothing much to panic. it is mostly due to the long-term effects of diabetes. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My mother is 65 years old and diabetic for the last 15 to 20 years.

people with schizophrenia are not usually violent. in fact most violent crimes are not committed by people with schizophrenia. however some symptoms are associated with violence such as delusions of persecution. substance abuse may also increase the chance a person will become violent. if a person with schizophrenia becomes violent the violence is usually directed at family members and tends to take place at home. the risk of violence among people with schizophrenia is small. but people with the illness attempt suicide much more often than others. about 10 percent (especially young adult males) die by suicide. it is hard to predict which people with schizophrenia are prone to suicide. if you know someone who talks about or attempts suicide help him or her find professional help right away. people with schizophrenia are not usually violent.	are people with schizophrenia violent?

"""atherosclerosis starts when high blood pressure smoking or high cholesterol damage the endothelium (a thin layer of cells that lines arteries keeping them toned and smooth) "" says richard stein md national spokesperson for the american heart association. ""at that point cholesterol plaque formation begins. "" ""it's a jumble of lipids or cholesterol cells and debris and it creates a bump on the artery wall "" explains stein. as the process of atherosclerosis continues ""the bump gets bigger. "" a big enough bump can create a blockage. atherosclerosis tends to happen throughout the body. ""so if you have plaque in your heart you're at a higher risk for stroke and vice versa "" says stein. atherosclerosis usually causes no symptoms until middle or older age. once narrowings become severe they choke off blood flow and can cause pain. blockages can also suddenly rupture causing blood to clot inside an artery at the site of the rupture."	what causes atherosclerosis?

"in most cases you will not be eligible for tax subsidies through the affordable care act's exchanges if you have employer provided coverage. and in many cases the coverage available through an employer may be more affordable because most employers help subsidize coverage for their workers. if a spouse or dependent is not covered through your employer plan and if they meet the income thresholds (adjusted gross income below 400 percent of the federal poverty level) then they should be able to shop in the exchanges and receive a tax subsidy. one caveat. there are some instances where even when an employer offers coverage you can shop in the exchange because the employer coverage may not be deemed ""affordable. "" the law contains certain guidelines as to what ""affordable"" employer coverage means. your employer is required to give you notice if the coverage they offer is not affordable. so check with your employer. but if they have not provided this notice it is most likely that only your spouse and other dependents may be eligible for tax subsidies through the insurance exchange."	can you only use a tax subsidy (when employed) if your employer doesn't offer coverage to spouses/dependents? . does it have anything to do with the amount they contribute?
i'm sorry you're going through this. medication management is challenging enough without throwing lupus into the mix! your physician is in the best position to assess this situation. if he or she feels the plavix is causing the rash then i'd suggest listening to that advice. using creams and ointments won't cause the rash to go away if it is in fact an allergic reaction to the plavix. however creams and ointments might make the rash feel better. if the rash is caused by an allergic reaction to the plavix then the only thing that will make the rash go away is removing the plavix which your internist already plans to do. don't expect the rash to immediately disappear when your internist takes you off the plavix. it may take some time for the rash to completely go away. if the rash doesn't go away your internist will work with you to determine what's causing it and develop a treatment plan that reduces the side effects of any medication. i wish you all the best as you go through this process! could be an allergy to a pet dust or even a candle that you burn. i would suggest seeing an allergist	how do i know if i'm allergic to a medication(plavix)? . i'm on generic plavix but have had a rash for several months that won't go away. my internist thinks i'm allergic to the plavix & is going to switch me to a different medication. but i was recently diagnosed with lupus so am on plaquenil for that (had the rash before started that med). as long as i take steroids the rash doesn't itch but it doesn't go away. i've tried all kinds of creams ointments etc. if i switch medications & that isn't the cause then what?

if your penis is only slightly bent it will not interfere with sexual activity. without having an exact diagnosis it would be very premature to know if there was a treatment or cure; you would need to be examined by a urologist first. there is a condition called peyronie's disease that you can read about that involves a bend in the penis during erections. i don't know if you have this particular condition or not since you have had this condition apparently from birth.	my penis is slightly bend towards right does it going to affect my sex life and how to cure it. i have this condition since birth.

there's no test that will predict the severity of a reaction. the amount of ige antibodies produced doesn't correlate with how severe a reaction is. [immunoglobin e antibodies (ige) are produced in excess by allergic people. ] at one point a child may have a severe reaction and another time it may be much less severe. it could be due to the amount of the food they ate whether or not it was an empty stomach if they already had a viral infection -- all kinds of factors.	what predicts the severity of a food allergy?

a tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue that's formed by an abnormal accumulation of cells. normally the cells in your body age die and are replaced by new cells. with cancer and other tumors something disrupts this cycle. new cells are made when they're not needed and old cells don't die. as this process goes on the tumor continues to grow as more and more cells are added to the mass. primary brain tumors emerge from the various cells that make up the brain and central nervous system and are named for the kind of cell in which they first form. the most common types of adult brain tumors are gliomas or astrocytic tumors. these tumors form from astrocytes and other types of glial cells which are cells that help keep nerves healthy. the second most common types of adult brain tumors are meningeal tumors. these form in the meninges the thin layer of tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord and can grow from a number of different kinds of brain and spinal cord cells.	what is a brain tumor?

some antiviral medicines reduce the severity and shorten the duration of influenza ( flu ) symptoms by 1 or 1½ days if given within 48 hours of the first symptoms. 2 these medicines are not intended to substitute for getting a flu immunization each year. rather antiviral medicines are important for controlling outbreaks and preventing the spread of infection especially in people at high risk for developing flu complications. the antiviral medicines zanamivir and oseltamivir are used to prevent and treat influenza a and b infections. they can reduce the severity and shorten the duration of flu symptoms. 5 amantadine and rimantadine have been used to help prevent and treat the flu caused by influenza a (but not influenza b) infection. but for the past few years the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has advised doctors not to use amantadine or rimantadine to treat or prevent the flu. 4 these medicines have not worked against most types of the flu virus. it is important to talk with your doctor about the medicine that is best for you. for more information see: flu: should i take antiviral medicine? medication choices two types of antiviral medicines can treat influenza infections: zanamivir or oseltamivir (used to treat and prevent influenza a and b infections) amantadine or rimantadine (used to prevent or treat influenza a infections) what to think about the effectiveness of antiviral medicines can vary from year to year. some years a medicine may not work against the types of influenza virus causing symptoms. your doctor can help you decide whether antiviral medicines are likely to help you. most people do not need antiviral medicines. they recover from influenza without developing complications. but given how sick most people are when they have the flu some people may choose to take medicine even if they are at low risk for complications. you cannot prevent the flu or make yourself feel better faster by taking: antibiotics. for more information see the topic using antibiotics wisely. large doses of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin c or zinc. herbal remedies such as echinacea. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat influenza?

arthritis is inflammation in a joint. diagnosis is based on a history of joint pain stiffness and/or warmth redness or swelling and physical examination. the examination can demonstrate swelling and often limited range of motion of the joint. x-ray examination can support the diagnosis and often disclose the type of arthritis and it's severity. early diagnosis is important for early treatment. many types of arthritis can progress without treatment. this can lead to permanent destruction of cartilage bone and ligaments which can result in deformity and loss of function that is not reversible. moreover some forms of arthritis are associated with disease elsewhere in the body. to avoid injury to other body tissues early diagnosis can be crucial.	how is arthritis diagnosed?
most helpful answer you can wear anything you want. cotton or not. cotton undies do help if you are prone to vaginal yeast infections but they are not absolutely necessary. when you are pregnant just wear clothing that is comfortable and has room for expansion. i am not sure what your boyfriend is reading.	i'm pregant does everything i wear have to have cotton in it? . my boyfriend is sure he read that now that i'm pregnant everything i wear has to have at least a percentage of cotton in it. i know that my panties should be cotton but i can't find answers about the rest of my wardrobe. this is making it difficult to find suitable pants for my work uniform.

hepatitis c is caused by a virus that is spread through contaminated needles or blood products and less commonly through sexual intercourse. about 10% of patients with chronic hepatitis b also are co-infected chronically with hepatitis c virus (hcv). the two viruses interfere with each other and one usually predominates. if hepatitis c is the predominant infection treatment is directed against the hepatitis c. patients infected with both viruses are at higher risk for complications of liver disease. there is no effective vaccine against hepatitis c. persons with hepatitis c should be vaccinated against hepatitis b to prevent co-infection.	what about co-infection with hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus?
a positive test result for double-stranded dna (dsdna) antibodies is consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. but it must be correlated with a person who has clinical signs and symptoms that suggest lupus. as the presence of this anti-dsdna can indicate a higher risk of lupus nephritis kidney inflammation that can occur with lupus. this test can confirm the need to closely monitor the kidneys. only half the people with lupus have a positive test so a positive or negative test does not mean you have lupus.

in short the answer is often. a lot of couples trying to conceive spend a lot of energy timing sex with mathematical precision to the woman's ovulation. theoretically the approach makes sense. recent studies have shown the window of opportunity for a sperm to fertilize an egg is pretty small: essentially it's only the four to five days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself. your best chances are on the day before and the day of ovulation. so the key would seem to be to have sex frequently in that five- to six-day window. but while timing your lovemaking exclusively to those few days makes logical sense it has some drawbacks -- primarily because your body doesn't always behave with clockwork regularity. even if your cycle is regular ovulation can occur at any time during the cycle. if you're having sex on the day you think you're ovulating and you're off by a few days you may be out of luck. so the expert advice is to hedge your bets: have sex at least two to three times every week. and if you've got the stamina why stop there? studies have shown that as long as your partner has a normal sperm count having sex every day of the month further increases your chances.	how often should we have sex to get pregnant?
intercourse during pregnancy is safe for most women. special situations in which women might be advised to avoid intercourse include prior preterm labor multiple miscarriages infection bleeding amniotic fluid leak and a condition called placenta previa or low placenta.

pregnancy is really about numbers: one of your wife's eggs available for fertilization (at the time of ovulation) and a few hundred million of your sperm waiting around for that egg to emerge. the odd are really in favor of fertilization in most cases. having sex everyday is just fine. you don't really have to wait and store up a volume of semen (the bulk of an ejaculation is not sperm but semen from the prostate gland). the more sperm that is ready and waiting the better. the color or consistency is not something you should worry about. the semen really needs to be where you can't see it if you know what i mean. assuming everything is in order the frequency that you have sex the volume of your semen will not be a major factor in achieving a successful pregnancy but you do have to have sex so get off of the computer and go for it.	"planning to have a baby should i have sex ""everyday"" on my wife's fertile days? my semen vol drops below 2ml if everyday. my semen volume is usually 2. 5 ml if the gap between two ejaculations is 2 days or more bu if it occurs everyday it drops below 2 ml which im afraid that it might be low for conception. also only the first spurt of semen is thin with a white tint but the rest of the ejaculate looks normal."

check the side of the canister for the number of puffs it contains. then keep track of how many times you use it each day. this way you can estimate when your metered dose inhaler is likely to run out. put that date right on the canister. be sure to have your prescription refilled one to two days before this date. some mdi's contain a color-coded side window that indicates when the medication is running out. it may be difficult for you to keep track of how much you use your inhaler -- perhaps because you only use it every once in a while as a rescue medication. if so ask your doctor about mdis that count the puffs each time you press the inhaler. or ask about getting two inhalers at a time. when one runs out get a refill so you always have an inhaler handy. throw away the mdi when it is empty even if it continues to spray.	how do i keep track of how much medication is in my metered dose inhaler?

yes you definitely can still suffer from allergies after having your tonsils removed. the tonsils are fleshy pads of tissue at the back of the throat. they are part of the lymph system. the lymph system helps the body fight infections by filtering and removing the bacteria and viruses that make us sick. unfortunately the tonsils do nothing for removing pollen -- the usual source of seasonal allergies. seasonal allergies occur when an allergen stimulates an over-response by the immune system. this 'histamine reaction' causes swollen tissue in the nose and/or eyes itching runny nose and other unpleasant nasal allergy symptoms. if you have no known drug allergies you can safely try an over-the-counter allergy product. i'd suggest one of the non-drowsy types. wishing you well!	can you get still get allergies even if you don't have tonsils? . i got my tonsils removed when i was younger but this year i've been sneezing a lot when the seasons change.
herpes simplex on the upper lip of any infant may not be treated unless it appears to progress. antiviral drugs can be used in infants if clinically-indicated like an herpetic outbreak in or near the eyes. herpes spreads along a nerve route and will not course through the body internally from a lip lesion. because the baby is so young and immunocompromised a medical professional should be consulted and the baby carefully examined to determine an individual course of action.	my 3. 5 month old has a cold sore on upper lip. is she old enough for anti-viral medication? if so what kind? . i have read about the dangers of the herpes virus in newborns and the spread to liver/brain. i will be calling my doctor but chances are they will say it's not a big deal however a baby in uk died because it wasn't treated and the virus spread internally. i want to avoid this and have some information at the ready about antiviral medication.

thanks for the question. aspirin is a very risky medication to use during pregnancy -- its use is generally cautioned in the 1st and 2nd trimester (pregnancy category c) and should generally be avoided in the 3rd trimester (pregnancy category d). given your unique situation it is absolutely important that you talk to your physician and other health care providers to discuss the risks and benefits of your medications especially during pregnancy. also i encourage you to use one pharmacy with one medication profile so we can check for interactions and check for medications that should be avoided in pregnancy. you should consider having all of your medications on a personal medication list and show this list to your doctor health care providers and pharmacist.	i experienced a tia after giving birth. i’ve been on aspirin therapy but am 6 weeks pregnant. should i stop taking it? . it was recommended not to have any further pregnancies due to the increase in hormone levels and the higher likelihood of clot formation. is it healthy for the developing fetus/placenta growth to be on aspirin? my cholesterol was high at the time of my stroke but it is now much lower and i exercise on a regular basis. i have been very healthy following the stroke and have suffered no lasting effects from it.

although advice may vary generally cold water or cold compresses are best for shingles. hot water may make shingle blisters worse. heat increases blood flow and may cause further inflammation and swelling. taking a cool bath or using cool wet compresses on your blisters may help relieve the itching and pain. ice can also provide relief for pain and itching. however it is important not to apply the ice directly on the skin or it may stick. it is also important not to leave the ice on for too long because it can cause frostbite. always talk with your doctor about the best treatment for your shingles.	is hot or showers ok when you have shingles? warm daily
i have had no problems with using a numbing agent like orajel with my patients and my own kids. it is one of many things that we have used including cool teething toys moist-chilled washcloths and oral pain meds. i would suggest trying the orajel on your own gums so that you get a sense of how it feels/how long it lasts. it can certainly take the edge off especially for those middle of the night awakenings.

i would say whichever you feel you can do most successfully. smoking is a huge health risk factor and can affect blood sugar levels. if you choose to do that first which makes a lot of sense you can still make small changes to your diet while taking medication. for example eating at the right times to coincide with medication and checking blood sugar can be a good first step while you kick the smoking habit. once your smoking habit is under control you can dive deeper into diet and exercise. but the key is starting somewhere and taking it one small step at a time. good luck! see more. smoking cessation health center a healthy type 2 diabetes diet	what is more important for a newly diagnosed diabetics? change diet or stop smoking?

"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it can't hurt to get an opinion about your breast pain from a plastic and reconstructive surgeon preferably the one who performed the original procedure. while it's likely the cause of the pain is simply scar tissue that has developed over the years it could be something else. and that's why getting an examination is the first step in figuring out what is causing your pain. as you probably know all breast implants run the risk of becoming somewhat stiff and hard over the years as a result of encapsulation by fibrous tissue. as time goes on this tissue can cause pain due to ""pulling"" on adjacent tissue or the breast implant itself. and of course breast implants do not in any way protect against breast cancer. any woman with cosmetic breast implants should receive the same routine mammograms as a woman with natural breasts. if you can't see the surgeon who performed the original surgery you can always start by seeing your family doctor or primary care provider. he or she will do an initial evaluation and get you off to see a specialist if needed. wishing you well!"	i'm in my late 50's and have implants. my right breast hurts when touched in one spot. should i be worried? . i have not had any injuries to my breast.

conversations between dr and patient are confidential and protected. telling your doctor that you may have a substance abuse problem and asking for help will most likely result in the suggestion and encouragement to enter rehab; however your doctor cannot force you to go. although in most cases cocaine abuse does not require detox most individuals who use cocaine also have other substance abuse including alcohol prescription painkillers and illicit drugs. in this case medical detox treatment can help them remove all the toxic chemicals related to their substance abuse from their body. after substance abuse detox treatment most people benefit from going through a rehab program or participating in behavioral therapy. substance abuse is more than a surface activity and usually stems from some deeper issue. a rehab program or counseling service will be able to help the individual get to the bottom of their cocaine use and help them resolve the issues. groups such as 12- step groups and other non-traditional non-12 step programs offer support within the community. these programs offer suggestions and explanations on how to avoid relapse. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	if i go to a dr and tell them i need to quit cocaine cold turkey will they call cops or force me into rehab or something. i just realized i let coke take over and went hard in the paint over the last 3 days. i need to quit no tapering just be done. but i know it will hurt in many different ways. if i go to a walk-in clinic or a dr will they call the cops or force me into rehab or something like that becausei cannot have either of those happen.

most helpful answer there has been a backlash against low fat diets leading people to go in the opposite direction embracing diets high in saturated fat diets. the truth is diets low in saturated fat won't reduce heart disease risk if the saturated fat is being replaced with refined carbs. this decreases hdl (good cholesterol) and can increase triglycerides and the blood sugar response. but as both of the review studies below demonstrate when saturated fat in the diet is replaced with plant and fish sources of fat (omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) it decreases heart disease risk -- hdl increases and ldl (bad cholesterol) decreases. <link> <link> this is basically the mediterranean diet -- low in saturated fat high in fruits and vegetables and healthy fat sources like olive oil and nuts. while the french may have diets higher in saturated fats they also tend to be leaner walk more and eat other heart healthy foods like fruits and vegetables. while the evidence continues to evolve there isn't enough to recommend a diet high in saturated fat to reduce heart disease.	could you provide a few links to the major studies showing excessive saturated fat is unhealthy? . this website and the american heart association continue to recommend a diet low in saturated fat. but the current buzz on the internet is that there is really little evidence for that position. in fact france eats a diet high in saturated fat yet has a low rate of deaths from heart disease (<link> <link> ). can i see links to the original studies showing sf is harmful?

there are two ways in which peyronie's disease can be treated: surgery or non-surgical treatment. because the plaque of peyronie's disease often shrinks or disappears without treatment most doctors suggest waiting one to two years or longer before attempting to correct it with surgery. in many cases surgery produces positive results. but because complications can occur and because many of the problems associated with peyronie's disease (for example shortening of the penis) are not corrected by surgery most doctors prefer to perform surgery only on men with curvatures so severe that sexual intercourse is impossible. there are two surgical techniques used to treat peyronie's disease. one method involves the removal of the plaque followed by placement of a patch of skin or artificial material (skin graft). with the second technique the surgeon removes or pinches the tissue from the side of the penis opposite the plaque which cancels out the bending effect. the first method can involve partial loss of erectile function especially rigidity. the second method known as the nesbit procedure causes a shortening of the erect penis. penile implants can be used in cases where peyronie's disease has affected the man's ability to achieve or maintain an erection. a non-surgical treatment for peyronie's disease involves injecting medication directly into the plaque in an attempt to soften the affected tissue decrease the pain and correct the curvature of the penis. vitamin e pills haves also been shown to benefit some men with peyronie's disease. another less invasive option is laser treatment to thin the plaques of peyronie's disease.	how is peyronie's disease treated?
yes you probably should. as you know shingles is contagious during the blister phase. your grandchildren would be susceptible to getting chickenpox from coming in contact with your blisters.

when you use splenda instead of sugar you decrease the total carbs in baked goods which in turn may help blood sugars. there likely isn't a difference in the amount of carbohydrates in whole wheat versus white wheat although whole grains are more nutritious and contain more fiber. it's really up to you to decide what to do. if you truly enjoy regular baked goods consume them in moderation but make sure you count the carbs. if it is a packaged item the total carbohydrates are listed per serving. if this isn't the case you can estimate. one mistake people make is only checking sugars when it's total carbohydrate in the food that matters most for optimal blood sugar control. if you want to eat baked goods more frequently using splenda and other ingredients like vegetable oil instead of butter can be helpful. you can always make smaller batches for yourself if your husband isn't game. people with diabetes are at higher risk for heart disease and other medical issues so following a healthy diet is important. keep up the good work managing your diabetes!

i'm sorry you're going through this. a healthy sex life is good for your overall wellbeing. i'd suggest you first consult a gynecologist to make sure there's no physical issue that needs to be addressed. at the same time you can discuss your lack of sex drive with your gynecologist to see if you would benefit from some counseling. perhaps a psychotherapist can help you with any emotional issues that are blocking you from having a healthy sex drive. you might also head over to webmd's sexual health communities to talk over the situation with other women who have the same issue. sometimes just finding someone else going through the same thing can be helpful. wishing you all the best!	i am 21 years old and have been married for about 2 1/2 years. however i have no sexual drive. what could cause this? . i enjoy sex once i have started it but i just do not have the desire to have sex.

prevacid or lansoprazole has recently moved from prescription strength to over-the-counter. the over-the-counter dose is labeled for adults 18 and older. this medication is intended to treat stomach ulcers or heartburn that occurs 2 or more times per week. it is not a quick fix to elevate symptoms for heartburn. it slows the production of acid within the stomach over a period of time and is taken daily for 14 days. we recommend seeking medical advice if the product needs to be taken for more than 14 days. i would not give prevacid to your 9-year-old child. while this product is found over the counter it still must be used according to its labeled directions in order to be safe and effective. if your child is having constant heartburn or stomach issues seek medical advice from your pediatrician. consider looking at the cause of the symptoms to help educate your child. for instance eating slower avoiding certain foods that trigger symptoms or eating smaller portions may help his/her symptoms. while medications are readily available and sometimes seem to be the quick fix look at preventing the symptoms by changing behaviors.	can my 9-year-old take over-the-counter prevacid?
hello any time you have sex there is a chance of pregnancy. i say you should take a test it might not be enough time away from the time you had sex so you might have to wait a while also sometimes periods like to play what i call peek- a-boo it might start back up. stress is definitely a huge part of tons of menstruation problems so try to relax i hope i helped! - jg	i had protected sex and i got my period but it randomly stopped. am i pregnant? . he used a condom and pulled out on top of that. my period came on time the day after and it was a normal period so i didn't stress anymore. then the next 2 days i started overthinking it and my period became lighter and basically stopped. i've done lots of research and it seems like i'm not pregnant and my stopped period is due to stress but i still don't know. i'm scared to take a pregnancy test because i'm afraid my parents will find out. yes i know i'm young but please help.

"if you have employer-based insurance now and will continue to do so until you retire there is no need for you to take any immediate action. when you retire and lose your employer-based insurance you will have a ""qualifying event"" which will allow you to shop for a marketplace plan even though you are outside of the open enrollment period. you probably want to start your application and shop for plans at least two months before your employment-based plan ends."	if i plan to retire next year but not before march does the march 31 deadline for health insurance still apply? . how far ahead of losing my current insurance should i sign up? it seems best to wait as long as possible so the government can get more bugs ironed out.

just like many antibiotics clarithromycin can cause upset stomach nausea vomiting and diarrhea. however there isn’t any contraindication regarding a history of ulcers when taking this medication. if you are taking any ulcer medications it would be important to check with your pharmacist to make sure there aren’t any drug interactions that would decrease the effectiveness of your ulcer medication which would cause flare-ups. the medication can be taken with or without food. if the upset stomach is present try taking it with food to see if it subsides. if at any point it worsens you should consult your health-care provider to see if another medication is better for you.	can taking clarithromycin 500 mg make my ulcer pain worse?
this is a great question and i'm glad you asked! yes indeed you can develop allergies throughout your life. in fact it's rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on the first exposure. (this does happen especially with certain foods like peanuts and shellfish. when this happens it usually occurs in infancy or childhood and produces a very strong allergic reaction. ) an allergic reaction is basically the body's overreaction to a perceived threat. if you're exposed to a potential allergen (food pollen medication etc. ) the body may not react at all or may produce a mild immune response to that substance. this may not produce symptoms. after multiple exposures to the same allergen the body may overreact to it causing an allergic response. this can range from mild (rashes vomiting) to severe (swelling of the face or throat difficulty breathing). a severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis and requires immediate medical attention. if you suspect you have developed an allergy to a substance i'd suggest you consult your primary health care provider. also i'd suggest you avoid whatever substance you believe is causing your allergic reaction. what begins as a mild allergic response on one exposure can vault to anaphylaxis on another exposure. hope this helps! yes. that is why you have to be careful in finding the best products and treatments that you are going to make use of. for example the best tattoo removal is something that will not cause allergy to your skin. check out www. disappearinginknyc. com.	can you develop an allergy at anytime of your life?

is he passing stools? this is a very important question because if he is not then it may point to obstruction. another possibility is that there may be some mild gastritis. you can manage the pain by giving syrup colicaid (simethicone) 5 ml only when there is the pain. for the vomiting you can give syrup ondem (ondansetron) 5 ml thrice a day for three days. wait for at least half an hour after giving ondem to give any food or water. i would also prefer if you get him evaluated physically since he is lethargic you said. he may be dehydrated. for further information consult a paediatrician online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My son is 4 years old.

lysol and lysol-brand products have been around for generations. your grandmother used it and probably throughout a pregnancy or two (or in my grandmother's case. thirteen pregnancies! ) it is probably one of the most safety-tested of all surface disinfectants so it is both safe and effective. there are no warnings or precautions about using this product when you are pregnant and as far as i know absolutely no links to adverse effects. like any product using it in a well-ventilated area is usually recommended. read the directions on the product itself to make sure you are using it properly. for more information go directly to the source: <link>	lysol disinfecting spray during pregnancy. is it ok to use the lysol disinfecting spray during pregnancy?
common symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding and diarrhea but there is a wide range of symptoms among patients with this disease. variability of symptoms reflects differences in the extent of disease (the amount of the colon and rectum that are inflamed) and the intensity of inflammation. generally patients with inflammation confined to the rectum and a short segment of the colon adjacent to the rectum have milder symptoms and a better prognosis than patients with more widespread inflammation of the colon. the different types of ulcerative colitis are classified according to the location and the extent of inflammation: ulcerative proctitis refers to inflammation that is limited to the rectum. in many patients with ulcerative proctitis mild intermittent rectal bleeding may be the only symptom. other patients with more severe rectal inflammation may in addition experience rectal pain urgency (sudden feeling of having to defecate and a need to rush to the bathroom for fear of soiling) and tenesmus (ineffective painful urge to move one's bowels). proctosigmoiditis involves inflammation of the rectum and the sigmoid colon (a short segment of the colon contiguous to the rectum). symptoms of proctosigmoiditis like that of proctitis include rectal bleeding urgency and tenesmus. some patients with proctosigmoiditis also develop bloody diarrhea and cramps. left-sided colitis involves inflammation that starts at the rectum and extends up the left colon (sigmoid colon and the descending colon). symptoms of left-sided colitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal cramps weight loss and left-sided abdominal pain. pancolitis or universal colitis refers to inflammation affecting the entire colon (right colon left colon transverse colon and the rectum). symptoms of pancolitis include bloody diarrhea abdominal pain and cramps weight loss fatigue fever and night sweats. some patients with pancolitis have low-grade inflammation and mild symptoms that respond readily to medications. generally however patients with pancolitis suffer more severe disease and are more difficult to treat than those with more limited forms of ulcerative colitis. fulminant colitis is a rare but severe form of pancolitis. patients with fulminant colitis are extremely ill with dehydration severe abdominal pain protracted diarrhea with bleeding and even shock. they are at risk of developing toxic megacolon (marked dilatation of the colon due to severe inflammation) and colon rupture (perforation). patients with fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon are treated in the hospital with potent intravenous medications. unless they respond to treatment promptly surgical removal of the diseased colon is necessary to prevent colon rupture. while the intensity of colon inflammation in ulcerative colitis waxes and wanes over time the location and the extent of disease in a patient generally stays constant. therefore when a patient with ulcerative proctitis develops a relapse of his disease the inflammation usually is confined to the rectum. nevertheless a small number of patients (less than 10%) with ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis can later develop more extensive colitis. thus patients who initially only have ulcerative proctitis can later develop left-sided colitis or even pancolitis.	what are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis?

both emotional and physical stress (such as a serious illness or recovery from surgery) have been associated with hair loss. it is possible that stress induces hormonal changes that are responsible for the hair loss since hair loss is a known consequence of other hormonal changes due to pregnancy thyroid disturbances or even from taking oral contraceptives. nervous habits such as scalp rubbing or hair twisting or pulling may also be responsible for hair loss. these habits may be responses to psychological stress in some people and may be another cause of stress-related hair loss. excessive hair-pulling is a form of impulse-control disorder medically referred to as trichotillomania. the hair loss from hormonal changes often disappears after a period of months to two years. as with other stress-related symptoms learning and practicing effective stress-management techniques can help reduce the severity of the symptoms.	is there a correlation between hair loss and stress?

the chance of you getting a serious infection or parasite (trichinosis) from a few bites of undercooked pork or this incident harming your baby would be extremely small. assuming you are in the united states and are eating inspected meat from a reliable grocery store or butcher ultimately from a highly-inspected meat-packing facility these pork-related events are very very unusual. now if you ate undercooked pork from a wild boar someone shot or from a dubious supplier that is a different issue. call your ob or primary care medical provider with your story so you can have some patient-specific advice but in the meantime. relax. you and your baby are probably going to be perfectly fine and your mother is going to be over-cooking pork to the point of burning it from now on!	expecting mother ate undercooked pork! . so i am 5 months expecting and yesterday i went over to my mothers for dinner. my mother had prepared me a pork chop and part of it was undercooked. before i had realized some of it was undercooked i already had eaten half of it then i freaked out and stopped eating it. now i'm wondering if i should have my dr. perform tests for bacteria/ staph infection and trichonosis and other parasites? i just saw this article about pork on webmd new today and now i'm a nervous wreck.
guilt can cause some interesting side effects. i suspect you can achieve intercourse with your wife because you are comfortable with her and marital relationships are appropriate. you may be having problems having sex with someone other than you wife because you have deep-down feelings of guilt or remorse about this forbidden relationship. there is not likely anything wrong medically with your penis but since your penis is controlled by your brain perhaps this is where you should focus. we all possess our own sense of right and wrong so maybe your brain is trying to tell you something? maybe if you asked your wife for permission to have sex with your girlfriend things may be easier. or not. maybe its psychological due to overwhelming feelings of guilt caused be being a loser scumbag get rid of the girlfriend and enjoy life with the one you committed to. all i am going to say is that you should not be having sex with anybody outside of your wife. maybe that is divine intervention trying to let you know and could be the root of your problem. your girlfriend may know about your wife but does your wife know about your girlfriend. things to consider. just because your girlfriend knows about your wife doesn't make the guilt go away. if your wife doesn't know i think it has a lot to do with your subconscious guilt. my boyfriend was cheating on me and he couldn't get an erection for me. so i think it has to do with guilt regardless of the use of an enhancer.	why am i not able to have sex with my girlfriend though i am able to have sex with my wife? please advise. i have a girlfriend and a wife. i have same feelings for both of them. when it comes to sexual intercourse i am enjoying for-play with both of them and sex only with my wife. when i am with my girlfriend my penis does not get erected. my penis will get erect for a while then it lost erection. would you please help me so i can enjoy sex with my girlfriend too.

a person can become infected with tuberculosis bacteria when he or she inhales minute particles of infected sputum from the air. the bacteria get into the air when someone who has a tuberculosis lung infection coughs sneezes shouts or spits (which is common in some cultures). people who are nearby can then possibly breathe the bacteria into their lungs. you don't get tb by just touching the clothes or shaking the hands of someone who is infected. tuberculosis is spread (transmitted) primarily from person to person by breathing infected air during close contact. there is a form of atypical tuberculosis however that is transmitted by drinking unpasteurized milk. related bacteria called mycobacterium bovis cause this form of tb. previously this type of bacteria was a major cause of tb in children but it rarely causes tb now since most milk is pasteurized (undergoes a heating process that kills the bacteria).	how does a person get tuberculosis?
vitamin d3 levels should be between 20 to 50 ng/ml. a level of 34 ng/ml vitamin d is normal and is ruling out vitamin d deficiency. if the weight loss is of short duration it may be due to thyroiditis or some acute infection. if the weight loss is of longer duration it may be due to no appetite malabsorption or some chronic disease like tuberculosis and diabetes. i advise you to consult your physician. you may need to have blood and urine tests for confirmation along with thyroid profile blood sugar and chest x-ray. regarding memory loss there can be a variety of causes for memory problems like dementia other amnestic syndromes depression anxiety and brain lesions. it is important that you have a proper assessment to determine the cause. vitamin b12 and omega-3 fatty acid supplements may be helpful. try to avoid stress. for further information consult an internal medicine physician online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am a 34 year old female.

it is certainly possible. having unprotected sex for years without getting pregnant you are either very lucky or something is amiss. it would not be likely that a medical provider would do a fertility work-up on either one of you now especially since you are on oral contraceptives now but the possibility does exists that there may be a fertility problem. i advice you to see what book market it well <link>	could i or the person i'm with be infertile? . i been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years i'm a college age student and along time ago we discovered i was allergic to latex. anyways i didn't have any form of birth control for like the first two years we were having sex.

that actually could be normal. but one of the questions i have for this particular patient is whether or not they’re using the spray the right way. with many of the sprays it’s important that you follow the directions that are included in the packaging and that you tilt your head the right way. sometimes if the head is tilted too forward it’s gonna run out. the other thing is too is that maybe their nasal tissue is actually irritated. a lot of people don’t realize that constant use of sprays and topical products can make the tissue a little sensitive and that might be the reason why they’re getting the runny nose. so it might be time for a little bit of a break let the tissue heal a little bit and then we can possibly restart therapy. but once again it’s really important that they let you know their pharmacist know about this is what’s going on because we may be able to say to them “yes this is a common side effect” and “let’s go over your technique again” or the pharmacist might say “you know what? it’s time to go back to your doctor or healthcare provider to revisit it and let’s see if there’s something else that could be given”.	each time i use astelin two sprays per nostril twice daily my nose starts to run. is that normal?
about half of the women who have symptoms of the uti do not have at uti but rather urethritis (irritation of the urethral opening where you urinate). a menstrual cycle and the items use you for your period (tampon pads) can create some of this inflammation; even shower soap or bathing can cause irritation.	bladder problems after period feels like a uti. i am 26 and for four months now for a week after my period i have been feeling symptoms that feel like i have a uti. tests came back saying i was fine but i feel the need to pee all the time. i am not sexualy active. i am drinking plenty of water and tried cranberry juice.

"the usual ""reference range"" (or normal range) for vitamin d levels in the blood is 30 to 74 nanograms per milliliter. so while your result falls within the normal range it is toward the low end. did your doctor advise you take a vitamin d supplement (or to take calcium with vitamin d added)? if not then he or she must feel you have nothing to be concerned about. however if you've been told you have osteoporosis or osteopenia then you might consider using a calcium supplement that contains vitamin d. vitamin d helps the body absorb the calcium better. if you'd like to get a bit more vitamin d in your system you can spend a little time in the sunshine every day (how pleasant! ) drink milk fortified with vitamin d or eat more saltwater fish (like cod) or liver. this article "" are you getting enough vitamin d "" might be helpful to you. if your doctor wasn't concerned enough to address your vitamin d results i wouldn't worry about it too much. hope this helps! your level of vitamin d is considered normal if it is between 30-100 according to my internist. so while yours is normal you may consider taking a regular over the counter vitamin d. mine was taken recently and my results were 17 very deficient. 20-30 is considered low. my doctor put me on 50 000 iu's once a week for 8 weeks and then 50 000 once every 2 weeks for another 8 weeks. i have been having a terrible time with my gums puffing up and bleeding ( i have always taken great care of my teeth and this is like a nightmare) chipping of several teeth without knowing it hurting all over my body and joints and losing hair like crazy along with many other symptoms. i'm 51 by the way. hope you find this somewhat helpful. any questions just let me know and i'll see if i can answer them."	is my vitamin d of 36 to low i am 73? . my dr said my vitamin d is a little low - and that is all he said about that.

the answer is: it depends. you need to discuss this with your gynecologist. many factors affect whether or not a tubal ligation reversal may be successful. some of these factors are: your age your general health status the type of tubal ligation procedure you had whether or not you previously had a successful pregnancy whether or not you have had any other gynecological surgeries such as for endometriosis or fibroid tumors these are not the only considerations. obviously if you're past the age of menopause reversing your tubal ligation will not enable you to get pregnant because you're no longer producing eggs. because it's been so long since you had your tubes tied the records about the type of procedure performed may no longer be available. however if the doctor who performed the procedure is still practicing you might consult him or her to discover if the records are available. taking this information to your current gynecologist will be helpful in determining if tubal ligation reversal might be successful for you. wishing you all the best!	can a tubal ligation be reversed. its been 17 and ahalf years since i have my tubes tired. me and my partner would like to have a baby sometime in the next 2 to 3 years can my tubal ligation be reversed so i can get pregnant

an ent doctor would have advised you to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery and septoplasty. surgery is the treatment of choice because your problem seems to be chronic (from longer duration). if you do not want surgery then you can take nasal spray (a combination of steroid and antihistamines) for a month mucolytics for a week and antibiotics for 14 days. early morning jogging is really good for patients having sinusitis. please follow the advice for a month and check if you have any improvement in your symptoms. since the pollution levels are high in your locality i would advise you to do exercise and jogging at home itself. for further information consult an ent otolaryngologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am suffering from nasal blockage for the past 1.5 months.

paget's disease is a long-lasting (chronic) condition that causes abnormal bone growth. bone is constantly being replaced as bone tissue is broken down and absorbed into the body then rebuilt with new cells. in the early stages of paget's disease bone tissue is broken down and absorbed much faster than normal. to keep up with the rapid breakdown of bone tissue the body speeds up the bone rebuilding process. but this new bone is often weak and brittle causing it to break (fracture) more easily. paget's disease usually affects the bones in the pelvis spine thigh ( femur ) skull shin (tibia) and upper arm ( humerus ). one bone or several bones may be affected by paget's disease. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what is paget's disease?

during the first visit for getting a dental bridge the abutment teeth are prepared. preparation involves recontouring these teeth by removing a portion of enamel to allow room for a crown to be placed over them. next impressions of your teeth are made which serve as a model from which the bridge pontic and crowns will be made by a dental laboratory. your dentist will make a temporary bridge for you to wear to protect the exposed teeth and gums while your bridge is being made. during the second visit your temporary bridge will be removed and the new permanent bridge will be checked and adjusted as necessary to achieve a proper fit. multiple visits may be required to check the fit of the metal framework and bite. this is dependent on each individual's case. if the dental bridge is a fixed (permanent) bridge your dentist may temporarily cement it in place for a couple of weeks to make sure it is fitting properly. after a couple weeks the bridge is permanently cemented into place.	what is the process for obtaining a dental bridge?

"then go to alanon for help. i am not sure how much help a ""walk-in"" clinic will provide to you. they certainly cannot provide the ongoing care and support that you may need to stop your drug use. doctor do not call the police when someone discloses illegal drug use. they cannot force you into rehab but this could be something they may suggest based on your usage and state of health."	if i go to a dr and tell them i need to quit cocaine cold turkey will they call cops or force me into rehab or something. i just realized i let coke take over and went hard in the paint over the last 3 days. i need to quit no tapering just be done. but i know it will hurt in many different ways. if i go to a walk-in clinic or a dr will they call the cops or force me into rehab or something like that becausei cannot have either of those happen.
"everyone feels some discomfort about bringing up this topic. people (especially women) with incontinence problems tend not to bring them up during a routine examination. unfortunately some health care professionals don't automatically ask questions about urine leakage timing amount and frequency of incontinence episodes. one way for anyone to feel empowered about this difficult topic is to arrive for a medical appointment with some written descriptions about the problem. this can be as simple as a list of symptoms but what i find most useful is a three day bladder diary that details exactly what is going on with a patient. . in addition you can answer a standard set of questions in writing and share them during your appointment. this is an easy way to steer the conversation in the right direction. you can say something like ""i jotted down some items that i want to share with you so i wouldn't forget. "" here are some standard questions that will help you describe your problem: do i have strong sudden urges to urinate? do i urinate more than 8 times in a 24-hour period? do i have uncontrollable urges to urinate that sometimes result in wetting accidents? do i leak urine on the way to the bathroom? do i leak urine when i laugh or cough or when i participate in active sports? do i frequently get up two or more times during the night to go to the bathroom? do i avoid places because i do not know if there is a restroom near by? do i go to the bathroom so often that it interferes with my activities? do i frequently limit my fluid intake when i'm away from home so that i won't need to worry about finding a restroom? when i'm in an unfamiliar place do i make sure i know where the restroom is? do i use absorbent pads to keep from wetting my clothes? remember that you and your doctor or other health care provider (nurse practitioner physician assistant) are partners in solving your health problems. the better the information about them you share the more likely you will both be successful. there are many types of solutions for incontinence issues so go to your appointment expecting to control or completely resolve your urinary symptoms. and if the first treatment you try doesn't work keep trying. no one should live with incontinence controlling their life. hi diane here are answers to some standard questions that you asked: do i have strong sudden urges to urinate? (yes there is a sudden urge to urinate) do i urinate more than 8 times in a 24-hour period? (no but atleast 5-6 times during 24 hours) do i have uncontrollable urges to urinate that sometimes result in wetting accidents? (yes it happens sometimes and sometimes at night too) do i leak urine on the way to the bathroom? (yes urine leakage is there on my way to bathroom) do i leak urine when i laugh or cough or when i participate in active sports? (yes cough and sneeze results in leakage) do i frequently get up two or more times during the night to go to the bathroom? (i have to get up at least once during night) do i avoid places because i do not know if there is a restroom nearby? (yes i am worried if i am at such place) do i go to the bathroom so often that it interferes with my activities? (no not very often to interfere activities) do i frequently limit my fluid intake when i'm away from home so that i won't need to worry about finding a restroom?

yes it is possible to have feelings of depression if you have bpd. borderline personality disorder is frequently misdiagnosed for bipolar or manic depression. the unstable moods associated with both conditions have in fact lead some researchers to believe that they are variants of each other. mood stabilizer drugs and talk therapy seem to be the best approach to help people with borderline personality disorder manage anxiety depression and aggression. at the same time it can help those suffering from this disorder deal with daily living. talk therapy can help you focus on understanding how your thoughts and behaviors effect yourself and others. it also helps you find more effective ways for you to approach daily stressors that could trigger negative or harmful behavior.	is it possible to have bpd and clinical depression? if so how can both be diagnosed effectively? . although i'm certain that i have borderline personality disorder it doesn't seem to cover everything i'm going through. i understand the personality shifts but for a while now i just get depressed and unmotivated for no reason at all and seem unable to shake the feeling. i've seen a doctor but i feel like he can't get past the bpd effects and it just doesn't feel the same.

symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop quickly over a few days to weeks and are caused by blood sugar levels rising above the normal range (hyperglycemia). early symptoms may be overlooked especially if the person has recently had an illness such as influenza (flu). early symptoms include: frequent urination which may be more noticeable at night. some young children who have learned to use the toilet may start wetting the bed during naps or at night. extreme thirst and a dry mouth. weight loss. increased hunger (possibly). sometimes the blood sugar level rises excessively before a person knows something is wrong. because insulin is not available the cells in the body are unable to get the sugar (glucose) they need for energy. the body begins to break down fat and muscle for energy. when fat is used for energy ketones -or fatty acids-are produced and enter the bloodstream causing the chemical imbalance diabetic ketoacidosis. this is a life-threatening condition. symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis are: flushed hot dry skin. loss of appetite abdominal pain and vomiting. a strong fruity breath odor. rapid deep breathing. restlessness drowsiness difficulty waking up confusion or coma. young children may lack interest in their normal activities. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes?

well those are two good reasons. a doctor's office is not the cleanest place in the world (actually one of the most potentially-contaminated places) and of course the lack of health insurance is a barrier. you cannot force a person (adult) to seek medical care but you may be able to encourage her to see a counselor to help her deal with her fear of germs. she can wear a mask avoid touching anything unnecessarily not use the clinic bathroom avoid shaking the doctor's hand and use a hand-sanitizer but in the end. the decision to see a medical provider is hers and hers alone.	what if a germaphobe won't go to a doctor? plus she doesn't have health insurance.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. here's the thing. this could be some sort of blemish like a clogged pore but that pimple also could be the sign of a sexually transmitted disease. even if you've never had unprotected sex you should see a gynecologist while that pimple is active so that he or she can diagnose the problem. i'd suggest calling to make an appointment as soon as possible. meanwhile you should avoid having sex even with a condom. condoms may not fully protect your partner against certain stds such as genital herpes. best of luck to you!	i had a vaginal pimple was popped cleaned but now keeps bleeding as if it were an open wound that won't stop bleeding. i've had a vaginal pimple before but it healed up and left sort of a scar like thing. but it came back again it popped so i cleaned it and covered the area with a bandaid to stop the bleeding now it just stop bleeding at all. it's like an open wound that doesn not stop bleeding no matter how many times i clean and cover it.

"rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to turn on itself attacking tissue that normally helps protect and preserve joint function. during an ra ""attack"" -- known as a flare -- the immune system sends out a barrage of white blood cells to the affected joint which in turn causes inflammation in the area. it is this inflammation that is responsible for the symptoms of ra including joint swelling and pain. osteoarthritis also known as ""old age arthritis"" or ""wear and tear arthritis"" is a natural degeneration of the cartilage between joints that occurs with aging. the degeneration can be worsened by overuse or injury but its impact is limited to the affected joints."

yes that would actually be fine. singulair works differently than zyrtec. zyrtec is an antihistamine. the one thing is though is that it may cause a little bit of increase in a drowsiness side effect. so what i recommend for patients is try taking it at home first and see how you feel before you decide to go out and take it road trip to florida or something like that because you wanna see how your body adjusts to taking these two medications together.	can you take singulair and zyrtec together?

technically it takes just one sperm to fertilize an egg and achieve a pregnancy but for each sperm that reaches and fertilizes an egg there are many millions that don't. the average ejaculation contains close to 100 million sperm and according to the world health organization men who have fewer than 20 million sperm per milliliter of semen may have difficulty conceiving. why do you need so many sperm if it takes just one to make a baby? because the journey from the vagina to the fallopian tubes through which the eggs travel from the ovaries to the uterus is an arduous one that few sperm survive. for those that complete the trip penetration of the egg is far from a sure thing. the egg is covered by a thick layer that makes fertilization more difficult. experts believe this process may be nature's way of allowing only the healthiest sperm to fertilize the egg thereby providing the greatest chances for a healthy baby.	how many sperm do you need to achieve a pregnancy?

high blood pressure -- in men and women -- is a big problem. one in every three adult americans -- about 65 million people -- have high blood pressure also known as hypertension. many more are at risk of developing it. over half of all americans 60 and older have it and over a lifetime the risk of developing high blood pressure is 90%. typically blood pressure increases with age. the risk of high blood pressure begins to climb when men hit 45 although it can occur in younger men. african-americans tend to develop it younger and have more severe hypertension. obesity or a family history of high blood pressure also increases risk. high blood pressure is especially dangerous because people can have it for years without knowing. in fact one in three americans with the condition doesn’t know it. despite these gloomy statistics however high blood pressure is not inevitable. there is plenty you can do to prevent delay and treat high blood pressure.	what are the statistics on high blood pressure in men?
both medications and surgery have been used to treat ulcerative colitis. however surgery is reserved for those with severe inflammation and life-threatening complications. there is no medication that can cure ulcerative colitis. patients with ulcerative colitis will typically experience periods of relapse (worsening of inflammation) followed by periods of remission (resolution of inflammation) lasting months to years. during relapses symptoms of abdominal pain diarrhea and rectal bleeding worsen. during remissions these symptoms subside. remissions usually occur because of treatment with medications or surgery but occasionally they occur spontaneously that is without any treatment.	what are the treatments for ulcerative colitis?

i'm sorry this situation is causing you distress. normal bowel frequency can range from about three times a day to about three times a week. bowel frequency is highly individualized. since you have a history of frequent bowel movements it sounds like that's the normal rhythm of your digestive system. but it also sounds like the situation has changed recently since you say it's now interfering with work. that means you should get checked out by a health care professional. you can start with your primary care provider. he or she can help you determine if there's anything abnormal going on with your system and if it needs to be treated. best wishes as you get this sorted out! elizabeth is right! if its part of your history to go that many times in a day then i wouldn't be too worried about it. i used to have to go only once per day and now i go 3x everyday. it was something to get used to so i totally understand how it can get in the way of work. i feel your pain but i've learned you have to be intune with your body and pay attention to what it needs. needing to go is a basic biological need and no one is going to stop you if you gave to go!	i have a history of a high frequency of bowel movements everyday. on average i go three times sometimes more in one day. i have always seemed to have an active digestive system and problems with upset stomach. it is coming to a point where everyday activities including work is being compromised. i literally have to use the restroom 3 times during a single shift at work and most likely once at home. is this normal? it makes it hard to plan activities at times and very uncomfortable at work.
lice are live so a person exposed can have live lice relatively fast if the encounter was sufficient. head to head activities use of combs/brushes sharing hats all can transmit lice from one person to the next almost immediately. nits are either unhatched eggs or the remnants of hatched egges. obviously the unhatched eggs are problematic since they will hatch in about two weeks and be mobile. soon they will be laying there own eggs. nits are firmly glued to the hair shaft. the unhatched nits are within a 1/4 or so of the scalp. the nits do not easily transfer from person to person unless it is with combs or brushes. live lice do not live long off of their chosen human hosts -- several hours at best (they gotta eat! ) so exposure from carpets furniture etc. is possible but considerably less likely. you will need to check your kids (and each other) for the next week looking for live lice and nits. they can be elusive so look carefully. if you don't find them you are probably in the clear from this unwanted birthday party gift. if you do find them they will need to be promptly treated. this is a gift that can keep on giving.	how long after my kids are exposed to nits or lice will they become infested or see symptoms? . my kids were exposed to nits at a birthday party on sat. it is now wed. how much longer must i worry that they might become infested?

this is very much a question for your medical team not for a forum like this one. no one here can possibly give an informed opinion because each case is different and the medical history of the individual is crucial in determining the best course of action. if you have questions about the risks and benefits of the suggested surgery have a long conversation with the surgeon and take plenty of notes. if possible have two or three people present for the meeting because the others will think of questions that might not even occur to you to ask. i wish you all the best!

your fiance is not likely pregnant based on those negative tests but those things can be very frightening. a late period can be due to stress. it is biologically possible (albeit rare) to get pregnant if any rogue sperm somehow make it into the vagina at the time your partner is ovulating. seminal fluid -- the clear fluid that will leak prior to ejaculation and during sexual stimulation -- can have viable sperm living in it from a prior ejaculation so it is best not to have this type of genital to genital contact in the future unless you are wearing a condom or if your fiance is not taking any form of birth control.	can you get pregnant from genital rubbing without ejaculation? . my fiance and i were fooling around the 22 october. i ejaculated nowhere near her genitals. i did not urinate after the ejaculation. she got on top of me and our genitals rubbed without any penetration. i did not orgasm. we are both virgins. on the 7th november she did a home pregnancy test as her period was late and the result was negative. she later did 2 different (brands) pregnancy tests on the 10 november and it was also negative. her last period started around the 7 or 8 october.

there are many factors that can increase a person's chance of developing oa including: *obesity. maintaining an ideal weight or losing excess weight may help prevent osteoarthritis of the knees and hips. weight loss or maintenance also can decrease oas rate of progression once the disease is established. * injury. people with joint injuries due to sports work-related activity or accidents may be at increased risk of developing oa. for example athletes with knee-related injuries may be at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knee. in addition people who have had a severe back injury may be predisposed to develop osteoarthritis of the spine. people who have had a broken bone near a joint are prone to develop osteoarthritis in that joint. * heredity. some people have an inherited defect in one of the genes responsible for making cartilage. this can cause defective cartilage which leads to more rapid deterioration of joints. people born with joint abnormalities are more likely to develop osteoarthritis and those born with an abnormality of the spine (such as scoliosis a curvature of the spine) are more likely to develop osteoarthritis of the spine. * joint overuse. overuse of certain joints increases the risk of developing oa. for example people in jobs requiring repeated bending of the knee are at increased risk for developing oa of the knee. * age. although age is a risk factor research has shown that oa is not an inevitable part of aging.	what causes osteoarthritis?
the nasolabial creases also known as the “parentheses” because their shape mimics parentheses are the curve-like grooves that begin where the nose meets the cheeks and typically end below the corners of the mouth. sometimes the muscle action in smiling can accentuate them. how do we get these? the answer is simple one word: aging. as we age nature spontaneously shrinks the fat layer in the face. the first area for the shrinkage to show is around the mouth because in fact it is the area where nature originally deposited the thinnest layer of fat. so as the fat diminishes the nasolabial groove becomes more prominent. expect this to begin even in the 40s. the good news is that we now have many products that can “fill” the grooves and make them look better. and by the way that is a far better answer than any mid-face or surgical facelift that claims to be able to “pull out” the nasolabial crease. that won’t happen satisfactorily. what will happen is you’ll have that over-tight over-pulled look. we’ve all seen some unfortunate people who made a bad decision by having the procedure done and they look like the “joker” in the batman movie. it’s a bad look and it cannot be easily reversed. artefill is a long-lasting non-resorbable filler that works because within it are little spheres of purified collagen. the collagen acts as a base upon which the body can increase its own collage production and therefore fill the groove. not everyone is familiar with artefill. over 20 000 patients have been treated with it since the launch of the product nearly three years ago. the manufacturer states there have been “no product recalls. ” artefill is not the only substance that fills the nasolabial crease but it should be considered because of its long presence in the tissue. as you know some of the fillers last four to six months. as with all fillers when done by a skilled injector whether it be an md or an rn it’s very difficult to tell that the filler material has been injected. it looks natural and feels natural.	what causes the creases around my smile?

a few ideas come to mind. anxiety? stage fright? low blood sugar? even if you've never experienced these before they can come on suddenly and without warning. did these symptoms occur when you were doing something in front of the class? if so my guess would be you experienced an episode of anxiety. if you weren't performing in front of the class then perhaps you had a bout of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). even though you say you ate breakfast the quality of the breakfast can influence your glucose levels. for example if you ate only pancakes and syrup you certainly could experience a dip in your sugars. if you ate some protein along with some whole grains then it would be less likely you experienced a dip in blood sugar. if you are otherwise healthy and this has never happened before there's probably no need to have it checked out. we all experience occasional bouts of panic or hypoglycemia. if it happens again or begins happening frequently then you should make an appointment to see a health care provider for an evaluation. good for you for maintaining your hydration. it's very important to overall good health!	today in class i was standing on my knees and i felt my heart pounding then i got sweaty. what could this be? . i felt like i was going to pass out. i had ate breakfast and this was at like 9:55 a. m. any ideas what this could be? i am very hydrated also.

pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs. usually the inflammation is caused by an infection but it can also be caused by breathing certain chemical fumes. it's a more common problem than most people think. usually pneumonia is a mild disease but some forms are very dangerous. in all cases you'll need a doctor's advice. pneumonia can affect just one lobe of the right or left lung a whole lung or both lungs many different kinds of germs infect the lungs and cause pneumonia. infected lungs leak fluids and shed dead cells. this material clogs up air sacs and makes it hard for the lungs to do their job of getting oxygen into the blood. without enough oxygen none of the cells in your body work as they should. pneumonia generally lasts about two weeks. even healthy people may feel tired or weak for a month or more after the lungs clear up.	what is pneumonia?

tartar is hardened mineralized bacterial plaque that has not been removed from teeth. when tartar control toothpaste containing the soluble sodium pyrophosphate is applied to the teeth and gums a chemical bonding process occurs. any calcium phosphate which has not yet bonded to teeth is attracted to the sodium pyrophosphate. when the new compound mixes with water it is completely dissolved. this means that the destructive calcium phosphate destined to form more tartar is instead removed with the rinse water. tartar control toothpaste cannot dissolve tartar that has already bonded with the enamel but it can stop future deposits from forming.

yes the high risk pools made available under the affordable care act were intended to function only as a bridge to coverage until the aca took full effect. so the plan is to transition people now covered by these plans onto plans sold through the state marketplaces and for the high risk insurance pools to eventually shut down. beginning this fall people will receive information about open enrollment and their health insurance options via the new online markets. the same is true for people enrolled in state high risk pools which existed prior to those set up under the aca. starting october 1 2013 open enrollment will begin on the exchanges and people will be able to shop for a health plan. those enrolled in a new plan before december 15 2013 will have coverage that takes effect january 1 2014.	will anything change with the high risk insurance pools because of the aca?
it's difficult to say exactly why your wife isn't losing weight without more information but here are some things to consider: how is she tracking her calories? it is possible that she is getting more than she thinks she is. seeing a registered dietitian can help her examine her food intake for hidden calories. high levels of activity mixed with low calorie intake may increase cortisol (levels stress hormone) and cause weight to stay where it is. this is a theory but i have seen it many times. your wife can experiment with cutting back the exercise or increasing her calorie intake. unless she's enjoying the exercise it likely isn't sustainable so i suggest she focused on doing something she enjoys. if your wife did not exercise at all before it is possible she is gaining some muscle mass and losing fat even the scale isn't moving. other factors can cause weight to plateau such as stress and lack of sleep. see this webmd article for more ideas. weight loss -- and especially weight loss maintenance -- can be a challenging task. i suggest your wife get help and support with the process. the key is to address the reasons for the weight gain in addition to tackling food and exercise.	my wife weighs 242lbs she only eats about 1500 calories a day and excercises. why can't she lose weight? . . my wife is 5ft 4inches tall weighs 242lbs and is a size 14-16 in pants sizes. she only eats about 1500 calories a day and exercises about 90+ minutes a day burning 800-1200 calories. she has been doing this for about 2 months and hasn't lost any weight. she has been diagnosed with ibs. she also has be test for hypothyroids and was negative. . .
there has been much discussion about the low absorption of medications after gastric bypass surgery. in your case the absorption should not be affected. however we are more concerned about side effects from medications that can hurt your system after this serious procedure. pain medications have been used after gastric bypass surgery although sparingly. it is important to remember that vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) can cause constipation. we do not want to further increase your risk of discomfort. so minimal use of pain medication with or without a stool softener is advised. the important key is to weigh the risks and benefits. we do not want you to be in pain but we also don’t want to over medicate or cause too many side effects. with proper rest and healing time pain medications may not have to be used at all. follow the advice and instructions you received from your surgeon.	can i take vicodin if i have had gastric bypass surgery?
they are actually not all the same and there are ones that should never be used in the lip. one thing that's very important is to find a dermatologist or plastic surgeon who is familiar with the different products available and can choose a product that's best for you. i tend to prefer only hyaluronic acid products for injections in the lips and that would be products like restylane or juvéderm ultra. these have a very natural look in the lip because hyaluronic acid is a natural ingredient to the skin and it holds water in the skin and can give a very nice natural plumpness to the lip and to the lines around it. but it has to be done very carefully and gently in order to look natural.	i have upper lip wrinkles and my lipstick bleeds into my lip line. i‘m thinking about fillers but how do i choose one?
it really depends on what and how much you are eating at mealtimes. if you are eating very little fat and protein which are filling you could be hungrier faster. here are some tips on how to stay full longer: include a protein source at meals and snacks. that could be an egg with your oatmeal lean meat with lunch and fish/beans at dinner. include a healthy fat source at main meals. that could be nuts/seeds topped on cereal or yogurt avocado on a salad or sandwich and veggies roasted with olive oil increase fiber intake by including beans fruits vegetables and whole grains which add to fullness. include salads at lunch and plenty of veggies with dinner. include 3-5 food groups (lean protein fruit vegetable whole grain healthy fat and dairy) at main meals 2-3 at snack time. keep your carbs consistent as directed by your healthcare provider. keep a journal and note which foods do a better job of filling you up because at least part of this is subjective. if you have recently changed your eating habits it may take a while to get used to eating different foods and more frequently. most people with diabetes eat at least 3 meals and one snack. good luck!	i have type 2 diabetes and i am confused why 1 to 2 hrs after eating a full meal i feel hungrier than before i ate.
it's very important that you check to see if you qualify for financial assistance to help pay for insurance. based on your description it sounds like you might. go to healthcare. gov to learn more. it's possible that you earn too little to qualify for a tax subsidy to buy a private insurance plan. and unfortunately you live in a state that has chosen not to expand it's medicaid program (insurance for people with low incomes) which leaves many people like yourself without good insurance options. still you should apply to make sure you're not missing out on available help. again go to healthcare. gov to fill out an application. you can also call the 800 number to ask for assistance: 800-318-2596.	al does not have a choice of providers-only bcbs. i can't pay the premium and won't be eligible for medicare for 2yrs. . i am a female will turn 63 this year am married. my husband is unemployed and i have retired. we both need the insurance; we are living solely on my ss. toni morse

deciding to exercise when you’re sick is a judgment call that you will have to make. i found an article that may give you some good guidance however located here. basically it depends on the illness the symptoms and your personal comfort level. if you do pursue exercise i would suggest to start by decreasing the intensity duration or frequency until you reach a level that’s appropriate given your illness and symptoms. also be sure to allow for ample time for rest and recovery.	is it ok to exercise with a cold? . i have a cold and i just started getting back into exercising. i have a lot of trouble sticking to my exercise plans but i've been doing well. now i have a cold and i skipped one day of exercise but i'm afraid to keep skipping exercise days. i usually just do the elliptical for 20-30 minutes 3 days a week. is it ok to work out with a cold or will i make the cold worse? i'm on about day 2 or 3 with the cold (i feel it mostly in my chest) and my colds usually last a couple of weeks.

"it's impossible to say what's going on without a physical examination. i suggest you make an appointment to see your primary care provider or your gynecologist. breast cancer can cause nipple soreness so it's not something you want to ignore (even if you're a man). another common cause of nipple soreness is called ""runner's nipple. "" this occurs when the nipple becomes irritated due to clothing rubbing across it repeatedly. this chafing can cause the nipple to become red inflamed and very tender. you don't have to be a runner to have this happen; any constrictive clothing can cause it from tight bras to t-shirts. you can treat runner's nipple by gently cleansing the nipple applying lotion and then putting an adhesive bandage over it to protect it from chafing. wishing you well!"	why do i have reoccuring pain and swelling in my left nipple? . for the past year or so only my left nipple will swell up and become painful and tender to the touch for about a week and then the swelling and pain goes away for about a month and then comes back again but only my left nipple.

nothing! at least not after midnight the night before. and don’t drink anything either. a few bites of food or sips of coffee before your colonoscopy may seem like no big deal. but you won’t be fooling your gastroenterologist. a little food goes a long way toward obscuring the view of your colon. that makes it harder to identify any polyps or potential tumors during a colonoscopy. it might seem almost unbearable to go hungry or face a medical procedure caffeine-free. but think how much more uncomfortable it will be to undergo a repeat colonoscopy because of your “poor prep. ” peanut butter	what am i allowed to eat before having a colonoscopy?
remember: before you start any exercise program consult with your health care provider. your health care provider can give you personal exercise guidelines based on your medical history. stretching exercise make the muscles limber and warm which can be especially helpful when you're pregnant. here are some simple stretches you can perform before or after exercise. neck rotation : relax your neck and shoulders. drop your head forward. slowly rotate your head to your right shoulder back to the middle and over the left shoulder. complete four slow rotations in each direction. shoulder rotation : bring your shoulders forward and then rotate them up toward your ears and then back down. do four rotations in each direction. swim : place your arms at your sides. bring your right arm up and extend your body forward and twist to the side as if swimming the crawl stroke. follow with left arm. do the sequence ten times. thigh shift : stand with one foot about two feet in front of the other toes pointed in the same direction. lean forward supporting your weight on the forward thigh. change sides and repeat. do four on each side. leg shake : sit with your legs and feet extended. move the legs up and down in a gentle shaking motion. ankle rotation : sit with your legs extended and keep your toes relaxed. rotate your feet making large circles. use your whole foot and ankle. rotate four times on the right and four times on the left.	what are some stretching exercises that i can do during my pregnancy?

most helpful answer under the law you can go without health insurance for up to three consecutive months without facing a penalty. since you're not eligible for medicare until may you will exceed that limit. the penalty is applied to each month you're uninsured. for 2014 the clock doesn't start until april 1. in your case therefore you're only skipping coverage for one month that is subject to the penalty. the penalty is the greater of $95 or 1% of your annual income. so you'll pay 1/12 of the yearly penalty -- it's likely to be a very small amount and no doubt much less expensive than buying insurance. however going without health insurance is a huge risk. if you're injured or diagnosed with an illness between now and may you're completely on your own with regard to the medical bills you'll incur.	i am eligible for medicare in may 2014. i currently have no health insurance. am i required to sign up for the aca?
i think you should see a psychiatrist about this. i have had a similar problem when i was younger that sort of fizzled out. anxiety disorders like ocd fall on a spectrum and can be difficult to diagnose. anxiety can be a huge factor in ones ability to listen and focus. that constant inner dialogue can be very distracting. in your case it sounds like you obsess over repeating the words being spoken aloud in your own head. when i was a child i would often mouth or whisper under my breath what i had just said. it was an obsession over checking how it sounded and if i said it correctly. you may not have clinical ocd but anxiety can manifest itself in compulsions and obsessions. you may benefit from taking an ssri along with a very low dose of clonazepam (klonopin). i have found at low doses klonopin can really quiet that inner dialogue and improve focus. just because it is a sedative doesn't mean you will feel sedated especially if your brain is overactive. my pdoc prescribed 2mg of abilify for the first month of starting the ssri and it has worked wonders! * i am not advising you what meds to take only a doctor can do that but if you decide to see a psychiatrist about this i would expect he would start with an ssri. something to think about.	do i have a learning disorder or do i have ocd? . i have problems paying attention when someone is speaking i focus on repeating there words in my head so i don't really hear what they are saying. when i try to focus on listening or really hearing them it gets worse. so what i'm finding out or realizing is that i tune things or people out not really listening so i don't repeat things in my head. all these years i just thought i had a learning disorder but starting to realize why i have difculties remembering things or learning things
some experts recommend that antibody blood tests should be used to screen healthy persons with no signs or symptoms for celiac disease. in italy where celiac disease is common all children are screened for celiac disease. experts in the united states do not recommend screening healthy persons for celiac disease. antibody blood tests are only recommended for individuals with a higher likelihood than normal of having celiac disease. these individuals are: individuals with chronic diarrhea (diarrhea that does not resolve in three weeks) increased amount of fat in the stool (steatorrhea) and weight loss individuals with excess gas bloating and abdominal distension first and second degree relatives of individuals who have celiac disease children with growth retardation individuals with unexplained iron deficiency anemia individuals with skin rashes suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis individuals with recurrent painful mouth sores (aphthous stomatitis) individuals with diseases known to be associated with celiac disease. examples of these diseases include insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus autoimmune thyroid disease rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus ulcerative colitis etc.	who should undergo antibody blood tests for celiac disease?

"blood pressure is a measure of how hard your blood pushes against the walls of your arteries. if the force is too hard you have high blood pressure (also called hypertension ). when high blood pressure starts after 20 weeks of pregnancy it may be a sign of a very serious problem called preeclampsia. blood pressure is shown as two numbers. the top number ( systolic ) is the pressure when the heart pumps blood. the bottom number ( diastolic ) is the pressure when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. blood pressure is high if the top number is more than 140 millimeters of mercury (mm hg) or if the bottom number is more than 90 mm hg. for example blood pressure of 150/85 (say ""150 over 85"") or 140/95 is high. or both numbers can be high such as 150/95. a woman may have high blood pressure before she gets pregnant. or her blood pressure may start to go up during pregnancy. if you have high blood pressure during pregnancy you need to have checkups more often than women who do not have this problem. there is no way to know if you will get preeclampsia. this is one of the reasons that you are watched closely during your pregnancy. high blood pressure and preeclampsia are related but they have some differences. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."	what are high blood pressure and preeclampsia?

children under any suspicion of pinkeye will be quickly isolated from other children at school. the parent will be called and the child excluded from school until they return with a doctor’s note. granted many types of pinkeye (conjunctivitis) are contagious. combined with the hygiene practices of kids pinkeye can quickly spread especially in a preschool or day care. the eye is very sensitive and easily becomes pink when irritated. allergies top the list for causing irritation and eye itching. you will see children constantly rubbing or knuckling their watery eyes with dirty hands of course. allergies are not contagious but they can sure set the stage for a secondary bacterial infection. highly chlorinated swimming pools cause pink or red eyes too. this chemical conjunctivitis is not contagious but a cautious teacher is not going to take the time to sort out the various types. they are going to exclude the child and have the medical provider properly diagnose them. i often see children excluded with a stye or babies excluded from child-care facilities with a clogged tear duct (nasolacrimal duct obstruction). these are not contagious. eyes get easily scratched during play. sometimes a baby with sharp untrimmed fingernails will scratch his own corneas. a corneal abrasion is very painful and the eyes will tear and become red or pink in response to this common injury. among the most common causes of pinkeye are bacterial and viral infections. these infections can be contagious. viral conjunctivitis does not usually require antibiotic treatment and typically resolves in two to four weeks. there may be a thin watery discharge from the eye. some types of viral conjunctivitis can be serious such as that caused by the herpes simplex virus. bacterial conjunctivitis is usually treated with antibiotic therapy. the discharge from the eye is thicker and can be profuse. often people with bacterial conjunctivitis can return to work or school 24 hours after starting antibiotic therapy. those with viral conjunctivitis may need to wait until their symptoms resolve. be sure to check with your doctor in both cases.	what are the symptoms of pinkeye and is it contagious?

wouldn't it be great if we could tell our body when to start and stop menstruating? i think it would be terrific! unfortunately it's not the case. there's no way to prompt your uterus to begin shedding its lining. because each woman's menstrual cycle usually varies slightly maybe you'll get lucky and start early. if you feel uncomfortable during that time of the month and you're not allergic to any medications you can try some of the over-the-counter preparations for menstrual pain and discomfort. while a health care provider might be able to prescribe something stronger for diagnosed pms (premenstrual syndrome) it's obviously too late to get an exam diagnosis and prescription before your anniversary in a week or so. i wish i had better news but look on the bright side: your periods are regular (which a lot of women are sure to envy you for! ) and you apparently have a great marriage. happy anniversary! i am a dancer so i often need to make my period come earlier because of date of my concert. so i satisfied myself that there are many ways to make your period come faster or even stop it for a day for special event. for instance information from this article was very helpful for me: <link> i hope it will help you too.	is there a way you can make your period start a few days earlier than the actual date? . i want to start today so i can be off by my anniversary next weekend. my period is scheduled to start on sunday 10/21/12 but will run into my anniversary weekend because my flow is normally 7 days. sounds crazy but i get very uncomfortable during that time of month and i need to be as sane as possible during my anniversary weekend
the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle. depending on the brand (you need to read the box) you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period. some tests claim you can test 3 to 4 days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result. it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test. for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin (hcg) in your urine. this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs. by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect. so step one: wait until you miss your period. step two: home pregnancy test. hope this helps! i had an accurate positive home test 2 weeks after conception with my 2nd child so yes it is possible. if it comes back positive best thing to do is go to the doctor and get it confirmed. thats what i did	if you have unprotected sex on nov 3 is it possible to tell with a home test that you are pregnant on the 18th?

a lack of iron can cause anemia and iron deficiency is a very common cause of anemia. this is because iron is major component of hemoglobin and is essential for its proper function. chronic blood loss for any reason is the main cause of low iron levels in the body as it can deplete its iron stores to compensate for the ongoing loss of blood. anemia that is due to low iron levels is called iron deficiency anemia. women are more likely than men to have iron deficiency anemia because of the loss of blood each month through normal menstruation. this is generally without any major symptoms as the blood loss is relatively small and temporary. iron deficiency anemia can also be due to small repeated instances of blood loss for instance from colon cancer or from stomach ulcers. stomach ulcer bleeding may be induced by medications even by very common over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen (advil motrin). in infants and young children iron deficiency anemia is most often due to a diet lacking in iron. a doctor's interpretation of complete blood count (cbc) results may give clues to suggest this type of anemia. for instance iron deficiency anemia usually occurs with low mean corpuscular volume (microcytic anemia) in addition to low hemoglobin.	can lack of iron in the diet cause anemia?
the problem with erections is that it’s supposed to be for most men mostly a sexual response. the blood flows in more than the blood flows out chambers fill up you get an erection. if the erection lasts too long the blood in there is not changing it starts to become old and it can become very very painful and it becomes a true emergency. so an erection that does not fade away after a couple of hours or if it becomes painful you need to go to the emergency room. now guys aren’t going to want to do that. o walk in with this great erection to say i have this horrible erection it’s been here for six hours. but the longer they wait the more likely of having permanent problems. sl: what are the permanent problems? permanent problems would be inability to ever get an erection again. or severe scarring. cutting off the blood supply you get scarring irritation inflammation and that continues long after the priapism has resolved. plus if you wait too long and we have to become aggressive with interventions sticking needles in that leads to scarring and leaking as well internally. if you have a persistent erection that does not resolve when it should if it becomes painful that becomes an emergency and should be seen. and if you delay if you think it might go away 3 or 4 or 5 hours later and it doesn’t then you’re increasing your risk of having a permanent erection disorder. so call your doctor go to the emergency room have it addressed right away.	why should i go to the doctor if my erection is painful or lasts too long?

many pediatricians still recommend waiting until your baby is a bit older -- 9 or 10 months -- before offering allergenic foods such as milk eggs peanuts tree nuts (such as walnuts or almonds) fish shellfish soy and wheat. even if there’s no added risk of causing an allergy they note that an allergic reaction may be easier to manage in an older baby. and some pediatricians concerned about the particular severity of allergic reactions to peanuts and shellfish still suggest staying away from them until your child is up to 3 years old. whole cow's milk should not be given to babies younger than 1 year old because the proteins in whole milk can irritate the stomach. yogurt and soft cheeses are fine however because the proteins in these dairy products are broken down and less likely to cause tummy trouble. you should also still wait until at least 1 – some experts say 2 -- to introduce honey which can cause a potentially serious disease called infant botulism.	how can i protect my baby against food allergies?
the most common complication is blockage of the intestine. blockage occurs because the disease tends to thicken the intestinal wall with swelling and scar tissue narrowing the passage. crohn's disease may also cause sores or ulcers that tunnel through the affected area into surrounding tissues such as the bladder vagina or skin. the areas around the anus and rectum are often involved. the tunnels called fistulas are a common complication and often become infected. sometimes fistulas can be treated with medicine but in some cases they may require surgery. nutritional complications are common in crohn's disease. deficiencies of proteins calories and vitamins are well documented in crohn's disease. these deficiencies may be caused by inadequate dietary intake intestinal loss of protein or poor absorption (malabsorption). other complications associated with crohn's disease include arthritis skin problems inflammation in the eyes or mouth kidney stones gallstones or other diseases of the liver and biliary system. some of these problems resolve during treatment for disease in the digestive system but some must be treated separately.	what are the complications of crohn's disease?
doctors make a diagnosis of oa based on a physical exam and history of symptoms. the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is based on a combination of the following factors: * a description of symptoms. * the location and pattern of pain. * certain findings in a physical examination. x-rays may be used to confirm a diagnosis and to make sure that no other type of arthritis is present. most people over age 60 reflect the disease on x-ray; about a third of patients have actual symptoms. sometimes blood tests are administered. while blood tests cannot point to anything in particular that can help a doctor confirm the presence of oa the tests can help the doctor determine the presence of a different type of arthritis. if fluid has accumulated in the body's joints the doctor may remove some of the fluid with a process called joint aspiration and may examine the fluid under a microscope to rule out other diseases.	how is osteoarthritis diagnosed?

you have to remember is that people who sleep well heal well. and that’s a very important factor that people have to understand especially in hospital settings uh or even at home if you’re not feeling well sleep is actually a healing mechanism. and you need to allow your body to have a little extra if it needs it. so you have to be somewhat careful but usually your amount of sleep is reasonably set unless you’re sleep deprived alright so you’re going to bed at the wrong time and getting up at the wrong time and not getting enough good quality sleep or there’s a medical condition on board that may make you need more sleep. usually when you hit the age of about 18 19 years old your amount of sleep is pretty set even though many people think that as they get older they need less sleep. in truth that’s not the case. what we if you looked at the total minutes of sleep that somebody gets over the course of a day they take naps which they don’t count towards their sleep or they may even take unscheduled naps where they are watching tv during the day because they are not working and they’ve retired and all of a sudden they are out cold.	will i need less sleep as i age?

there is a different flu vaccine every year based on the circulating strains. for the next season we will only have one vaccine covering all three anticipated strains. the vaccine will include a california h1n1 strain as well two australian strains – type a perth (h3n2) and type b brisbane strains. a few months ago millions of specially prepared chicken eggs were collected from special poultry establishments and then injected with those three strains one strain in each egg; an environment where the viruses will multiply for later harvest. june is the month when the fda tests the purity and potency of the anticipated strains. unlike last flu season all three be blended into one “trivalent” vaccine that will be licensed for distribution. in august the vaccine will be bottled; syringes filled and kept in cold storage for shipment in september. by october (hopefully) we will have sufficient vaccine for everyone. i would hate to see vaccine rationing and those lines forming again but it could happen if there is a glitch in any of these carefully planned steps. two weeks after getting the flu vaccine the host should develop immunity. then we wait. if enough people get vaccinated the flu will not spread rapidly like it did last year when we were caught unprepared. of course not everyone will want the vaccine. some skeptical people will hold back a few weeks or a month to see if anyone is having adverse reactions. if enough people remain vulnerable then the infection will spread in the community. last season nearly all of the early shipments were sent to health departments for mass immunization campaigns held at elementary schools just like the 1950’s. i work in a pediatric practice that sees about 400 patients a day including many high-risk children. it took months for us to acquire enough vaccines to immunize them. some of the local chain pharmacies had more vaccines than our clinic. we can never accurately predict the flu season until it arrives. the severity of the season depends on many factors from the effectiveness of the vaccine and accuracy of the anticipated strains to the distribution of vaccines and the acceptance of a sometimes-skeptical public when a “new” vaccine is promoted. for the most part i trust the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the fda. influenza is a killer and it costs billions to fight this annual visitor. as a world community we all have to roll up our sleeves in order to prevent the next global pandemic.	are vaccines ready for the upcoming flu season?
i suppose their could be a remote connection but there are hundreds of causes of tinnitus and vertigo/dizziness so it would not be prudent to blame these symptoms solely on the use of a cpap. as a matter of fact it would be wise to see an ear nose and throat specialist to be properly evaluated. more often than never the cause is in the inner ear (or brain) and have nothing to do with the use of a cpap. rarely the cpap can cause middle ear pressure issues (from air going up the eustachian tubes) and that can cause tinnitus or dizziness but i suggest that you search for other causes.	can cpap cause tinnitus and motion sickness?

"surgery is aimed at stopping further damage to the heart and improving the heart's function. procedures used include: left ventricular assist device (lvad): the lvad helps your heart pump blood throughout your body. it allows you to be mobile sometimes returning home to await a heart transplant. bypass surgery : the most common surgery for heart failure is bypass surgery to circumvent a blocked heart artery. heart valve surgery : as heart failure progresses the heart valves that normally help direct the flow of blood through the heart to the rest of the body stretch out of shape allowing blood to ""leak"" backwards. the valves can be repaired or replaced. infarct exclusion surgery (modified dor or dor procedure): when a heart attack occurs in the left ventricle (left lower pumping chamber of the heart) a scar forms. the scarred area is thin and can bulge out with each beat (an aneurysm). a heart surgeon can remove the dead heart tissue or the aneurysm. heart transplant: a heart transplant is considered when heart failure is so severe that it does not respond to all other therapies but the person's health is otherwise good."	what surgical procedures are used to treat heart failure?

as much as i would like to help you it is not possible to blindly make a diagnosis over the internet. a medical provider would need to see and feel this lump in order to make an accurate determination. and without a accurate diagnosis it would not be possible to suggest treatments. a few suggestions: first stop messing with it. this could be a deep cyst (sebaceous cyst or cystic acne). by squeezing it you may make it worse or cause an infection. second either see your primary care medical provider or a dermatologist so that you can have an accurate diagnosis. i can't imagine this lesion cannot be treated but you need that all-important diagnosis first.

an ear infection will not cause your throat to be red but it can cause lymph nodes to swell. an irritated throat can cause lymph nodes to swell. the commonality of both ear pain and a red throat at the same time could be a virus or bacteria. since your doctor may not know this answer even after an exam many will just put you on an antibiotic. some will rely on the results of a strep screen to make that determination. your dizziness may be related to your ear pressure/infection.	can an ear infection cause my lymph nodes to swell and my throat to become red? . i have been dizzy pressure in my head and ears doctors said i have an ear infection but now my glands are swollen.

"this is unusual behavior to be sure. i would not assume your daughter is doing this ""on purpose. "" she may be suffering from bowel incontinence and is embarrassed to discuss it. it concerns me also that you believe this behavior started after she attended basketball camp. bowel incontinence especially in a 12-year-old could be a sign of emotional trauma. i suggest you take your daughter to her primary care provider for an examination. children her age often will talk to a nurse or doctor about issues they won't discuss with their parents. be sure to tell the health care provider about the issue in private and then give your child some time alone with the provider so she feels she can safely discuss anything that might be on her mind. whatever you do don't punish or shame your child over this. your daughter is not doing this ""on purpose"" to make you angry irritate you or anything else. there definitely is an underlying issue here that needs to be addressed. please approach this problem in a sensitive and tactful manner. also if you put your daughter on miralax for constipation and never took her off it she may now have a diarrhea problem. the best solution for constipation is to eat a fiber-rich diet and drink plenty of water. medications or other treatments for constipation should be used only for acute episodes and for a very short period of time. wishing you and your daughter well!"	bowel issues in teenager. my 12 yr old daughter is having bowel movements in her clothes seemingly on purpose. i'm finding soiled underwear hidden in her room and soiled towels etc. i've questioned her repeatedly but she denies any problem. all i know is that she started this a few months ago after attending basketball camp and was having constipation issues. i started her on miralax but the problem is ongoing and i don't believe it is a constipation issue anymore.

first please confirm the pregnancy with a serum beta-hcg test (human chorionic gonadotropin) as urine pregnancy test is not reliable till eight days post missed periods. if the hcg levels are more than 5 ng/dl then she is pregnant. in that case as she has been a post c-section case medical abortion is not to be undertaken with either mifepristone or misoprostol simply. because the c-section scar would still be weak by one year and there are often chances of uterus rupture. the best option in that case would be an ultrasound guided dilation and curettage procedure for surgical abortion. please meet your gynecologist and get the needful. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My wife missed her periods and we doubt she is pregnant.

this is a good question for your pharmacist. i suggest making a call to any local pharmacy and asking their advice. in general medications are quite cold-tolerant. usually it's high temperatures that can break down certain components in certain types of medications. that's why most labels specify a temperature range at which to store the medication. in general if a person is having an asthma attack and needs a rescue inhaler do not sit around and debate whether or not the one on hand is any good. better to use what you have and hope it works. and meanwhile dial 911! also don't wait until you're having an asthma attack before you replace your questionable inhaler with one you know is good. be sure to always have a viable rescue inhaler on hand because you never know when you'll need one. wishing you well!	how does very cold temperature storage affect the use of asmanex inhalers? is it safe to use?

i've experience a poison ivy recurrence as well. my brother had been working outside with it (unbeknownst to him) and when he came inside decided he wanted to try and see if he could pick me up. he picked me up from behind and i my arms against my chest when he did it. he then ended up with a horrific poison ivy rash all over his arms face and legs. and i had a poison ivy in lines across my arms where his had touched mine. it eventually got better but 6 months later i got strep throat. when i got sick the rash re appeared in the exact same distinct pattern across my arms except it was a much lighter rash this time around…it still itched like poison ivy though. i'm guessing it had something to do with my immune system launching against my strep throat and somehow re-activating my original response to the poison ivy….?	can poison ivy rash return same place after 2 months? . rash returned same places on arms after 2 months since had first rash. . haven't been any where near any plants no pets to come in contact with poison ivy. any one ever hear of this happening?
most men have no trouble fathering children in their lifetime. but of those that do of couples that have a hard time conceiving that present to a fertility doctor 60 percent of the problems can be related to the female factor 40 percent to the male. and because male factor fertility can actually be a symptom of something more serious it’s not something to be ignored. testicular cancer often can present as a form of male infertility. hormonal and metabolic disorders can present as infertility. so when a couple presents to a doctor and is having trouble conceiving it’s really essential that the man go to a urologist get a separate complete exam blood test hormone test to be sure that there’s not something more serious that’s going on. and with a lot of the new advances in sperm aspiration and retrieval and the new assisted reproductive technologies doctors are just saying well it doesn’t work it’s not great but we don’t need much all we need is one sperm now and they bypass the evaluation so that the guys and their potential health or metabolic problems are being ignored. you can have congenital absence of the vas that may be a warning sign of cystic fibrosis that you may want to know about if you are having trouble conceiving so again that can only be found with a good urological exam. so the moral of this story is if you and your wife are having problems um -- conceiving then absolutely you should be seen at reproductive specialist on both the female side and a urologist ideally one with reproductive fertility training.	how common is it for a man to have a fertility problem?

unfortunately you won't find a plan that offers you an in-network panel you can access nationwide. unlike an hmo a ppo will give you access to out-of-network providers but you'll pay more to see doctors who don't participate with your plan. since you can't buy a health plan with a nationwide provider network in any case perhaps you want to consider sticking with an hmo to save money. however if it's important for you to have access to any doctor the ppo would be the better choice. it all comes down to your personal priorities.	i currently have mediblue hmo. i want to have out-of-network benefits so i'm considering a ppo with blue cross. . the ppo plan seems to cost more and give me less benefits. and i am not sure if the ppo will provide me with nationwide (in-network) coverage which is what i need.

yes you and your son together are considered a family. and at your income level you would qualify for medicaid. however if you live in a state not expanding it's program you as an adult will not be eligible. but your son will undoubtedly qualify for medicaid or the children's health insurance program. if your state is not expanding its medicaid program you can look for insurance through your state's marketplace. you would qualify for subsidies that would pay the bulk of your insurance costs (at your income level you won't pay more than 2% of the cost of your insurance plan) as well as financial help to lower any costs associated with your medical care. if you don't make enough money to file income taxes you won't be required to have insurance and you won't be charged a tax penalty. but i encourage you to find the contact information for your state's health insurance marketplace through healthcare. gov and then to talk with someone to get help getting you and your son covered.	i am a single mother with one son. making less than $20 000. do i have to get insurance? are we considered a family? . . your article said a family making less than $20 000 doesn't need to file taxes or get insurance. i only make $17 000.

inguinal hernias which occur when tissue bulges through the abdominal muscles and into the groin are caused by: an opening in the passage from the abdomen to the genitals (called the inguinal canal ) that should close before birth but does not. abdominal muscles that are weakened by aging and the daily wear and tear of life. conditions that increase pressure within the abdominal cavity such as frequent coughing or being overweight may contribute to the development of hernias. a femoral hernia sometimes mistaken for an inguinal hernia occurs when tissue bulges from the lower abdomen into the upper thigh just below the groin crease. the cause of a femoral hernia is often difficult to determine. if you do not have an inguinal hernia see information on other types of abdominal wall hernias. other types of hernias in the belly include spigelian incisional umbilical or periumbilical and epigastric. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes inguinal hernia?

well the great news is that you can reverse at least some of it. so the fact that you stopped what you have done that alone will not only prevent further damage but will also allow your skin to naturally repair itself. so that's one great thing. if you use topical retinoids; these are vitamin a derivative products whether it's over-the-counter products or from your dermatologist that also helps renew your skin and repair some of that damage. sometimes a damage has gone beyond what we can repair and you might see that over time so it's important to have a regular skin cancer screening and have the dermatologist look for anything that might be a sign of skin cancer because found early there's greater than a 96% cure rate. so you need to find anything early and also keep an eye on your own skin. if you see anything changing show your dermatologist. but you can repair to some extent and you can make a very big difference in your skin.	i did a lot of tanning when i was younger now i know better but can i reverse any of the earlier damage?
"this is a repeat of answer give by webmd health expert dr hoffman. i think this will answer your question. ""alprazolam (xanax) is an anxiety-relieving medicine that starts to work within about an hour after taking the pill. the level of drug reaches a peak in the bloodstream after one to two hours and its felt effects last on average about 5 hours. however xanax remains in the bloodstream long after its anti-anxiety effects have worn off. xanax’s average half-life is 11 hours. this means that it takes an average of 11 hours for the body to eliminate half the xanax dose. in older or obese people or those with liver disease xanax’s half-life is longer as long as 40 hours. it takes several half-lives to eliminate a drug completely. so for most people there may still be a small fraction of xanax in your blood two days or more after taking a single pill. people who take xanax on a regular basis maintain a higher drug level in the bloodstream and it could take several weeks to eliminate all the xanax from the body. xanax is excreted from the blood into the urine and is detectable in drug tests. different drug tests have different sensitivities and may or may not detect a low level of xanax in the urine.

hereditary colon cancer syndromes are caused by specific inherited mutations that cause colon polyps colon cancers and non-colonic cancers. hereditary colon cancer syndrome can affect multiple members of a family. approximately 5% of all colon cancers in the us are due to hereditary colon cancer syndromes. patients who have inherited one of these syndromes have an extremely high risk for developing colon cancer approaching 90%-100%. fortunately blood tests are now available to test for these hereditary colon cancer syndromes once a syndrome has been suspected within a family. familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) familial adenomatous polyposis or fap is a hereditary colon cancer syndrome in which the affected family members develop large numbers (hundreds sometimes thousands) of colon polyps starting in their teens. unless the condition is detected and treated early (treatment involves removal of the colon) a family member with fap syndrome is almost sure to develop colon cancer. cancers most commonly begin to appear when patients are in their 40's but can appear earlier. these patients also are at risk of developing other cancers such as cancers of the thyroid gland stomach and the ampulla (the part of the duodenum into which the bile ducts drain). attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (afap) attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis or afap is a milder version of fap. affected patients develop less than 100 colon polyps. nevertheless they are at high risk of developing colon cancers at a young age. they are also at risk for stomach and duodenal polyps. hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (hnpcc) hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer or hnpcc is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected family members tend to develop colon cancers usually in the right colon in their 30's to 40's. certain hnpcc patients also are at elevated risk for developing uterine cancer stomach cancer ovarian cancer cancers of the ureters (the tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder) cancers of the bile ducts (the ducts that drain bile from the liver to the intestines) and cancer of the brain and skin. myh polyposis syndrome the myh polyposis syndrome is a recently discovered hereditary colon cancer syndrome. affected patients typically develop 10-100 polyps during their 40s and are at high risk for developing colon cancer. the myh syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with each parent contributing one copy of the mutant gene. most people with the myh syndrome do not have a multigenerational family history of polyps or cancer of the colon but may have brothers or sisters with it.	what are hereditary colon cancer syndromes?

products that contain menthol are cooling to the skin and can distract from the itch. you can also leave your regular moisturizer in the refrigerator and applying it when it is cool can also be soothing. otherwise it is important to get to the underlying cause. i am amazed at how often it is simply due to dry skin even if it is only a little dry and that just by proper moisturizing on a regular basis the problem resolves. you should look for a cream rather than a lotion and apply it right after the bath or shower. also avoid excessively hot showers and keep the shower/bath to no more than 10-15 minutes. if that does not help it’s time for a checkup with your internist and dermatologist for further evaluation.	what is the best thing for itching skin?

"ask your gynecologist what could be causing your cycle to go awry. maybe it is related to having your iud taken out. or it could be hormonal. as you are trying to become pregnant are you taking any hormones? either way keep a ""menstrual journal"": a written record of how many days you bleed and how heavily it flows (and how much pain or other related symptoms you feel) on each of the days. show this record to your gyno after about 2 months. in the meantime be sure your gynecologist he or she is aware that you are having this bleeding problem. if there is pain either while you are bleeding or in that region any other time including during intercourse be sure to tell her/him that too. write it down as well on the menstrual journal. the idea is to determine a pattern. if your system becomes more stable and your periods become more regularly spaced and less heavy and severe as time passes that will be good because it should indicate that your hormones simply needed to adjust and are becoming normalized. but if this does not happen; if you keep right on having either very long periods or very heavy periods or more than one period a month or any combination of those things you will need to have your gyno do a complete examination and look over your menstrual journal; this will be crucially important because you will need to rule out any serious health issues that might have either started showing up because they had been hidden by the iud or have just developed right now. you may have endometriosis which is a condition that can be disguised by iuds or by taking birth control medications. you'll need to rule out anything like uterine or ovarian cancer which are unlikely but can sometimes happen. and you need to be sure you do not have hpv or other health conditions which can be catching. and you need to be certain the iud did not accidentally cause inflammation or injury either while it was in or while it was being removed. hope you are well soon; and good luck in becoming pregnant! if all goes well before long you will have a healthy baby! first get yourself in good health. it is do-able. be certain to tell not only your gynecologist but your primary care physician as well. and be sure both doctors know all medications and over-the-counter remedies including herbal ones you may be taking. these will have an influence on things as well. better health to you!"	had my period oct 1st-11th woke up today with bleeding. i am trying to get pregnant. why would i be bleeding again? . the iud was removed the 29th of september

copd and heart failure cause the same main symptom: shortness of breath with exertion. people with copd heart failure or both have a limited ability to exercise climb stairs or walk long distances. difficulty breathing occurs for different reasons in copd and heart failure. people with copd have difficulty exhaling all the air in their lungs because of lung damage -- often from years of smoking. when it takes longer to exhale completely it’s hard to increase the rate of breathing. most people with copd breathe comfortably while resting. during exertion though breaths start coming in before air from the last breath has been exhaled and shortness of breath results. in people with heart failure the heart does not pump blood efficiently. as in copd most people with heart failure can breathe easily when at rest. with activity blood flow must increase and the heart must pump harder and faster. if the heart can’t keep up blood “backs up” into the lungs. this fluid congestion causes shortness of breath.	what are the symptoms of copd and heart failure?

schizophrenia is a chronic severe and disabling brain disorder that has affected people throughout history. about 1 percent of americans have this illness. people with the disorder may hear voices other people don't hear. they may believe other people are reading their minds controlling their thoughts or plotting to harm them. this can terrify people with the illness and make them withdrawn or extremely agitated. people with schizophrenia may not make sense when they talk. they may sit for hours without moving or talking. sometimes people with schizophrenia seem perfectly fine until they talk about what they are really thinking. families and society are affected by schizophrenia too. many people with schizophrenia have difficulty holding a job or caring for themselves so they rely on others for help. treatment helps relieve many symptoms of schizophrenia but most people who have the disorder cope with symptoms throughout their lives. however many people with schizophrenia can lead rewarding and meaningful lives in their communities. researchers are developing more effective medications and using new research tools to understand the causes of schizophrenia. in the years to come this work may help prevent and better treat the illness.	what is schizophrenia?

"there are a couple of possible explanations for this light spotting. the most common one would be light breakthrough bleeding due to the hormones in your birth control pill (bcp). with prolonged bcp use the lining of the uterus can become thinner. this can make it easier for spotting to occur. often such spotting will present after intercourse or even heavy exercise. typically it does not develop into a full on ""period-like"" bleed. other reasons for spotting after sex can include problems with the face of your cervix. for example if you have a new infection with chlamydia that can make the cervix friable (easier to bleed when touched by fingers penis etc). if you had a polyp in the cervical canal the polyp tissue is very fragile and bleeds easily. . my best guess is bcp caused spotting. if the spotting persists or you have risks for chlamydia (e. g. new partner or multiple partners) you should see your gyn of clinic for follow up. if the bcp is the culprit for the poor cycle control a change in bcp formula or brand can be helpful."	i am on birth control. i experienced light bleeding for a couple of days after my cycle ended. what could be happening?

"hi the info below is from <link> schizophrenia is a serious brain illness. many people with schizophrenia are disabled by their symptoms. people with schizophrenia may hear voices other people don't hear. they may think other people are trying to hurt them. sometimes they don't make any sense when they talk. the disorder makes it hard for them to keep a job or take care of themselves. what are the symptoms of schizophrenia? schizophrenia symptoms range from mild to severe. there are three main types of symptoms. 1. positive symptoms refer to a distortion of a person's normal thinking and functioning. they are ""psychotic"" behaviors. people with these symptoms are sometimes unable to tell what's real from what is imagined. positive symptoms include: hallucinations : when a person sees hears smells or feels things that no one else can. ""hearing voices"" is common for people with schizophrenia. people who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem. delusions : when a person believes things that are not true. for example a person may believe that people on the radio and television are talking directly to him or her. sometimes people believe that they are in danger-that other people are trying to hurt them. thought disorders : ways of thinking that are not usual or helpful. people with thought disorders may have trouble organizing their thoughts. sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought. and some people make up words that have no meaning. movement disorders : may appear as agitated body movements. a person with a movement disorder may repeat certain motions over and over. in the other extreme a person may stop moving or talking for a while a rare condition called ""catatonia. "" 2. negative symptoms refer to difficulty showing emotions or functioning normally. when a person with schizophrenia has negative symptoms it may look like depression. people with negative symptoms may: talk in a dull voice show no facial expression like a smile or frown have trouble having fun have trouble planning and sticking with an activity like grocery shopping talk very little to other people even when they need to. 3. cognitive symptoms are not easy to see but they can make it hard for people to have a job or take care of themselves. cognitive symptoms include: trouble using information to make decisions problems using information immediately after learning it trouble paying attention. but your symptoms could be you just dreaming which is just seconds before you wake up that’s why there so clear to remember. but plenty to read and take in but please don’t dream about them or you will end up that way unless this is whatb you want. but if you think you going that way then seek help now. good luck"	does having a dream featuring hearing voices vividly qualify as a symptom of schizofrenia? . i experienced hearing voices once before but under the influence of drugs so it might have just been a bad trip. . however i just had a similar experience while in my sleep so i was wondering whether hearing voices qualifies as a prediction of an onset in schizophrenia or whether it is not comparable with hearing voices when awake. . thank you.

it sounds like you are ready to make a change which is good. i do not recommend dieting at this age as you are still growing and research shows dieting (especially at younger ages) is associated with weight gain over the long run. instead of losing weight i highly recommend focusing on creating a healthy lifestyle that is sustainable. speak with your parents about having everyone in the family eat well and exercise. have regular meals with plenty of fruits vegetables lean meats low fat dairy whole grains and healthy fats. a low carb diet means your diet will be deficient in key nutrients you need to grow and that includes calcium and vitamin d for bone growth. a recent study showed that young adults who ate intuitively focusing on hunger and fullness cues weighed less than those who had more controlled eating styles. so eat regular meals at the table stop when comfortably full and create healthy habits. you may not lose weight fast but the healthy habits will lead to weight that's right for your body type. seeing a pediatric dietitian can also help as they know what nutrients you need during this last stage of growth. to find a dietitian near you go to eatright. org. for more on teen nutrition see this webmd article.	after getting to goal weight can you switch from low carb to calorie counting? . i'm 5'5 and 174 pounds. i'm also 15 years old and i've made up my mind to diet. i just need to know whether after going to calorie counting for maintainance if i'd gain everything back. i'd like to lose 72 pounds. i believe this weight is okay for me because i don't have a large frame.

treatment for bacterial vaginosis consists of antibiotics. a few antibiotic remedies are routinely used. metronidazole (flagyl) taken by either oral (pill) form or by vaginal metronidazole gel (metrogel) is an effective cure. also available is the vaginal clindamycin cream (cleocin). the oral metronidazole can cause some minor but unpleasant side effects but is believed to be the most effective treatment. the gels do not typically cause side effects although yeast vaginitis can occur as a side effect of the medication. tinidazole (tindamax) is an antibiotic that appears to have fewer side effects than metronidazole and is also effective in treating bacterial vaginosis. recurrence of bacterial vaginosis is possible even after successful treatment. more than half of those treated experience recurrent symptoms within 12 months. it is unclear why so many recurrent infections develop. with recurrent symptoms a second course of antibiotics is generally prescribed.	what is the treatment for bacterial vaginosis?

"a blood type test categorizes your blood according to the major human blood group (abo) system. a person's abo type depends upon the presence or absence of two genes — the a and b genes. these genes determine part of the configuration of the red blood cell surface. possible abo blood groups include o a b or ab. the rh antigen is another compound that may or may not be present on the surface of red blood cells. the rh test determines whether this configuration is present (""rh-positive"") or absent (""rh-negative"") on an individual's blood cells. rh testing is performed because the difference in rh blood group types between an rh-negative mother and her rh-positive baby can lead to hemolytic disease a severe condition in which there is breakdown of the red blood cells in the newborn. if an rh-negative mother carries an rh-positive fetus she may develop antibodies against the rh component of the baby's red blood cells. these antibodies could cause hemolytic disease of an rh-positive baby in subsequent pregnancies. prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn is carried out by giving rh-negative mothers rho (d) immune globulin (brand name: rhogam) after delivery of an rh-positive baby. this prevents the mother's immune system from reacting to the rh-positive blood of any subsequent fetus."	i am going to be trying to get pregnant soon and want to know what are blood type and rh tests?

"boy do i hear you -- because i have the same thing! some people simply have a chronically runny nose. usually the fluid is clear and thin. this condition is called "" non-allergic rhinitis.

baby : your baby measures about 18. 9 inches long from head to toe and weighs almost 4 pounds. it fills almost all the space in your uterus now either lying with the head up or sometimes still with enough room to do somersaults. a layer of fat is forming underneath the thin wrinkly skin. baby's practicing opening his eyes and breathing. mom-to-be : although you've only been seeing the doctor monthly now you'll probably start seeing your practitioner every two weeks until the last month when you'll probably switch to weekly visits. you may continue to get backaches and leg cramps. you may also notice colostrum leaking from your breasts a yellowish fluid that precedes milk production. tip of the week : you might be carrying differently from others at the same stage of pregnancy. whether you're carrying higher or lower bigger or smaller wider or more compact depends on the size and position of baby your body type and how much weight you've gained. for more comfort drink plenty of fluids elevate your legs when sitting lie on your left side and wear support stockings.	what can i expect during week 32 of my pregnancy?
"it depends how long after actual ovulation. if one knows the actual date of ovulation conception can occur up to 72 hours after ovulation as sperm can live inside the cervix for up to 72 hours under ideal conditions. an oocyte/egg has at least a 48 hour lifespan after ovulation. as you may know the most likely time to conceive is about 14 days before the start of your next period. so if one had a regular 28 day cycle ovulation is around day 14; a regular 34 day cycle will have an ovulation around day 20. if one has a regular 24 day cycle ovulation can be as early as cycle day 10. the problem arises among women who have periods/bleeds which are not linked to an ovulation. these ""non-ovulatory bleeds"" can occur randomly as the too thick lining of the uterus begins to shed on its own. the woman in this case could have a bleed and then an ovulation anytime thereafter. an even more risky scenario would be the women who mistakes bleeding associated with the release of an egg/oocyte as a period. in that case she could get pregnant from intercourse during her ""supposed period"" because she is actually at a very fertile time. bottom line getting pregnant during a ""real"" period is unlikely--especially if it has been 14 days since ovulation occurred. if [there is a concern] do a reliable pregnancy test about two weeks after the date of intercourse. a urine test should be reliable around the time of [the] expected period. lastly if a woman is really scared about having an unplanned pregnancy the worry can cause her flow to be late. . a urine pregnancy test can help resolve any concerns."	can a women get pregnant after ovulation and while she is having her period?

most helpful answer thanks for providing all the great background information! if several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then that's probably accurate. a cyst is a pocket of tissue that's filled with some type of fluid. the type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst. some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus. it sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news. skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as you've described. the fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider re-evaluate this. it's possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed. only your health care provider can say for sure. cysts are an annoyance but luckily they're not a serious disease. good luck to you as you cope with this!	"how do you know if a lump on your breast that emits white liquid like a zit occasionaly is serious or not? . i've had it for about 6 years im 20 now in the same place with 3 different doctors looking at it all saying that it was nothing to worry about and just ""normal"". one doctor said it was a cyst caused from my bra and that i needed new bra's. it sometimes emited pus like a zit does usually in larger amount. though recently it has gotten slightly bigger and has a faint purpleish coloring to it like a bruise instead of my normal skin color like before should i go see a doctor again?"

that's a very good question. unfortunately the answer is no. any time the skin is cut with an incision a scar will develop. that's just the plain truth. there are several things you can do after surgery to minimize the appearance of a scar but it will always be there. after your incision has healed (and after your surgeon has given his permission) you can try massaging the scar several times a day using as much pressure as you can tolerate. a scar is basically a buildup of fibrous tissue. the more you massage this tissue and break it up the less noticeable the scar may be. you don't need to use a fancy product while doing this scar massage either. plain lotion is fine. it's the mechanical action of the massage that matters. when i was a plastic surgery nurse the surgeon i worked for always told patients to avoid applying pure vitamin e oil to any incision. this can cause reddening of the scar in some people. however a lotion or cream containing vitamin e is fine. remember that your scar should continue to fade over time. if your scar is unattractive to you there are some relatively new products on the market called silicone sheets or gel patches that seem to work quite well to help minimize scars. they're also rather expensive. reminder: no scar massage before your surgeon says it's ok. your incision needs to be fully healed before you start massaging it. wishing you all the best for a successful surgery and speedy recovery!	is there anything i can do to prevent scaring before abdominal surgery? . i have researched over the counter/ home remedies for post surgery. but is there anything i can do with a few weeks out?

excessive calorie intake and lack of calorie-burning are the main causes of weight gain. allergies per se does not cause weight gain but changes in food quality (switching from a food that is suspected of causing allergy to one of higher calories) and amounts of food can be a subtle cause if the person is not aware they are actually eating more calories. failure to thrive in infants is a lack of weight gain and would not be comparable.	can food allergies cause weight gain? . several people have told me this--that their seasonal allergies cause weight gain. one other says that her celiac disease causes weight gain--celiac disease usually causes failure to thrive in infants--could it cause weight gain in either children or adults? . thank you . sheila. wall@gmail. com
most helpful answer although the medication she is on often decreases appetite it can increase appetite in some people. i would visit a pediatric dietitian for an evaluation to make sure nothing else is going on. you can find a dietitian near you at eatright. org. in the meantime here are some things you can do at home: structure meals and snacks at the table and don't allow grazing between meals. provide a variety of food groups at meals (2-3 at snack and 4-5 at meals) especially protein rich foods and fiber (fruits vegetables whole grains beans) that help increase feelings of fullness. allow treats but provide them less often. encourage her to listen to feeling so fullness and remind her she can have more food at the next meal etc. allow at least an hour of day for physical activity. good luck!	my child wants to eat constanly and is on concerta for adha. dont know if symptom or eating disorder. she use to have curbed appetite being on the medicine but now eats non stop. gorges herself and thinks she is hungry non stop.

"a woman's fertility starts to decrease in her early 30s and takes a big drop after age 35. according to the asrm a healthy 30-year-old woman has about a 20 percent chance each month of getting pregnant. by age 40 that chance is only about 5 percent. experts say the main reason for the drop is that women are born with all the eggs they will ever have and the supply of eggs goes down with age. ""the quality of the eggs also goes down which increases the likelihood of miscarriage in older women "" says adelina emmi m. d. associate professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the medical college of georgia. ""you may hear about celebrities having twins at 50 but you don't always know the details like whether donor eggs were used. "" and though men produce sperm most of their lives and don't experience the sudden drop in fertility that women do a man's fertility may decrease gradually over time. ""as men age their fertility declines later and less dramatically than it does in women "" emmi says. ""there is also evidence that the risk of gene defects in sperm goes up with age. "" the risk of infertility also goes up when either partner has had diseases or surgery that could damage the reproductive organs. for example a major complication of sexually transmitted diseases for women is pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). this infection can lead to infertility because it causes scarring in the uterus and fallopian tubes. men may have reproductive abnormalities due to prostate surgery or a disorder of the testes resulting in abnormal sperm production. ""this is an area of medicine where getting a good patient history really counts "" emmi says. ""we can pick up all kinds of things that people may not realize affect their fertility--from chronic conditions like prediabetic states and thyroid disorder which can interfere with ovulation to blood pressure medication which can lower a man's sperm count. "" lifestyle risk factors that can impair fertility in men and women include smoking alcohol and drug use and sexually transmitted diseases. in women being overweight or underweight can interfere with the production of estrogen a female hormone that regulates the menstrual cycle and ovulation. according to the asrm too much body fat causes a woman to produce too much estrogen. too little body fat causes a woman to produce too little estrogen."	what are the main risk factors for infertility?

home treatment measures may help you control the symptoms of mild gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). these include making lifestyle changes and taking nonprescription medicines that reduce or block acid. these include antacids (for example tums) h2 blockers (for example pepcid ) and proton pump inhibitors (for example prilosec otc). if you have been using nonprescription medicines to treat your symptoms for longer than 2 weeks talk to your doctor. if you have gerd the stomach acid could be causing damage to your esophagus. your doctor can help you find the right treatment. you can make changes to your lifestyle to help relieve your symptoms of gerd. here are some things to try: change your eating habits. it’s best to eat several small meals instead of two or three large meals. after you eat wait 2 to 3 hours before you lie down. late-night snacks aren't a good idea. chocolate mint and alcohol can make gerd worse. they relax the valve between the esophagus and the stomach. spicy foods foods that have a lot of acid (like tomatoes and oranges) and coffee can make gerd symptoms worse in some people. if your symptoms are worse after you eat a certain food you may want to stop eating that food to see if your symptoms get better. do not smoke or chew tobacco. if you have gerd symptoms at night raise the head of your bed to by putting the frame on blocks or placing a foam wedge under the head of your mattress. (adding extra pillows does not work. ) avoid or reduce pressure on your stomach. do not wear tight clothing around your middle. lose weight if you need to. losing just 5 to 10 pounds can help. gerd: controlling heartburn by changing your habits along with lifestyle changes nonprescription medicines may be needed to control occasional heartburn. medicines used for home treatment of gerd include antacids (for example tums) h2 blockers (for example pepcid) and proton pump inhibitors (for example prilosec otc). if you have been using nonprescription medicines to treat your symptoms for longer than 2 weeks talk to your doctor. if you have gerd the stomach acid could be causing damage to your esophagus. your doctor can help you find the right treatment. for more information about prescription forms of these drugs see the medications section of this topic. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what can i do to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd at home?

most helpful answer in 2004 the institute of medicine made a general recommendation of 91oz (a little over 11 cups) for women and 125oz (over 15 cups) for men of total fluid intake each day. there are some things to keep in mind however. it’s estimated that 20-25% of your fluid intake comes from the food that you’re eating. for example lettuce can be around 95% water carrots 87% and broccoli 91%. in fact most of the foods that you eat contain some percentage of water even things like bread. the majority of our fluid intake comes from the liquids we consume. things like tea juice or coffee do count towards that total fluid intake each day. although there is a net gain some liquids that contain caffeine act as a diuretic (meaning that it makes you have to urinate) so there will be some small water loss due to that. prolonged physical activity or heat exposure will also increase water losses and may therefore raise your daily fluid needs. one way to determine your level of hydration is to look at your urine which should be fairly clear. if your urine is a very dark yellow then you may need to be drinking more water. yes it is necessary to drink 8 glass water per day. in todays life everyone is health concious and all want to become fit and away from diseases. we can take other liquid also instead of water for health purpose and for energy level we can take fruits juice fruit tea and other drinks also. yes it needs to be water the other drinks are in addition to.	does the body actually need 64oz of water per day or do other fluids count towards thia total as well? . some days i only post 2 or 3 out of 8 glasses of water on the webmd food and fitness planner chart but i also drink tea coffee and juice during the day. . does it really matter if the liquid isn't water?

"most helpful answer it would take a visual examination by a medical provider to determine the exact nature of your scrotal ""red blotch"". a brief description just doesn't do it. you may be correct about fungus -- common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris. tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated. another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap. no young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated. jock itch is a possibility. however that rash is usually itchy so that makes me question whether you have jock itch or something else. since i cannot tell based on your description it is something you should get checked out by your doctor. here is more information about jock itch. thank you very much for your input i have determined that it is jock itch and am getting a corticosteroid and some fungal cream as well"	what does it mean when there is a red blotch on your scrotum? . hello i am a 16 year old male and just recently found a red blotch on my scrotum it isn't itchy and it is always moist i am not sure if the moisture is puss or sweat i think it might be some fungal infection or just jock rash but can someone tell me what i might have?

we have several friends who are bipolar and they do not steal. there is no relationship to her stealing to the bipolar disorders. she just steals. more concerning would be a possible addiction to (narcotic) pain medication. hide your pills. keep them out of your medicine cabinet where she is likely snooping when using the bathroom. put the pain medication bottle in there (no pills) with some m&ms and note asking her to get some help. in the manic phase the person can tend to act impulsively/partake in unpremeditated risky behavior that they normally would not so therefore its possible that cheating and stealing are something that occur when she is in the manic swing of it. but it is no excuse to lie/cheat/steal. there are some people who are bipolar but would never cheat or steal but they would drive their car recklessly etc. call her doctor and express the things that are going on i am sure he/she would be a good help. bipolar disorder is about moods. lying cheating stealing is about their character. she has probably done it for so long that her bi polar disorder is a good excuse to get her out of tough situations like this one. no bi-polar disorder doesn't directly cause her to steal meds but the illness can cause her to not care that she is doing this activity. she needs to be under better care for her illness and taking her medication. so many people who suffer mental illnesses don't always take their medications. there are those who abuse even their own medications. she does need help. put your medications away!	my aunt steals pain killers and she is bipolar. does bipolar cause her to steal? . she is in her mid to late fourties. she claims she dosent steal pain killers but we have all seen her do it. now her sister claims that she steals the pain killers due to her being bipolar. i am wondering if this is in fact true or that her sister is just denying it to herself. which in turn is not able to get her the help she needs.

hand washing. both flu and cold viruses are transmitted through microscopic droplets from an infected person's respiratory system. if people cough or sneeze into their hands (without a tissue) they can contaminate every surface they touch. if you touch that same surface you pick up the virus. if you rub your eyes or nose you've just infected yourself. to protect yourself and prevent spread of cold and flu viruses: wash your hands frequently. use an alcohol-based gel if you don't have access to water. cough and sneeze into a tissue or into your hands. wash your hands afterward. when you cough turn your head away from others. if you have a sudden sneeze bend your arm and sneeze into it. don't touch your eyes nose or mouth. wash any shared surfaces (like phones and keyboards) frequently. viruses can live on surfaces for several hours. stay away from crowds during cold and flu season.	how can i prevent a cold?

here are some facts that may be helpful: in women with a predisposition to certain cancers ivf procedures may influence hormone production that triggers the disease's onset. becoming pregnant can also make it more difficult to detect certain cancers. it is good that you're having genetic testing to see if you inherited the gene for breast cancer. the brac1 and brac 2 results will help to determine your lifetime risk for developing breast cancer and to move forward with life. try to think positively about your pending test results as only good things can be gained. with this knowledge you'll be in the driver's seat in making decisions about your health and body. your doctor may have valid reasons for refusing surgery. with that said if your doctor is not explaining their rationale it may be appropriate to seek a second decision.	benign fibroadenoma (9 mm) in my right breast. the doc refuses to remove it. mom died of bc aged 57. plan on ivf. advice. there is also a cyst in my right breast (5 mm). the doctor also wants to keep an eye on that. since i want to go with ivf i am afraid the fibroadenoma might grow and i don't want any operations during my potential pregnancy. i am planning to test for brca 1/2 tomorrow i know it will take time to get the results but i am too worried. to my knowledge there was no other family member who had cancer in my family just my mom.

i read your query and understand the concern expressed by you. in regard to the current medication i would like to inform you that parocen cr is one option for premature ejaculation but does not have any effect on weak erection. it can be said that in last three years a new molecule is approved for the treatment of premature ejaculation which is equally effective and do not have common side effects encountered with parocen cr or other drugs which were in use three years back. i am not sure why your doctor prescribed you nano leo as it has minimal effect on erection. it is used for increasing testosterone level which has more effect on desire rather than erection. as you informed that you do not have any problem with desire the possibility of using nano leo is ruled out. regarding the viagra it has definite effect on erection and there is no doubt that it can be effective in your case. having said this i would like to know what was your initial problem premature ejaculation or weak erection? i commonly observed that people with erection problem try to rush the sexual intercourse because of fear that they will not able to maintain the erection for sufficient time. this kind of rushing develops artificial premature ejaculation. i need to inform you that if you developed your premature ejaculation in response to erection problem then there is need to treat only erection problem. as the cause suggests with treatment of erection problem the premature ejaculation will be treated automatically. in case you feel that both the problems are independent then there is need to address both issues simultaneously for correction of the problem. before we move to treatment part of the problem we need to identify the possible cause of the problem. i request you to post following details in the follow up query so that the cause of problem can be determined and so the treatment. 1. what do you mean by weak erections and premature ejaculation? describe what you think in detail. 2. how did the problem start whether it was of acute onset or was it on and off initially? 3. progress of the problem in the last six months. 4. duration of sexual activity - both maximum and minimum duration in last one year. 3. frequency of the problem in a week or in a month. 4. what are the factors that increase the problem in bedroom. 5. factors that relieve the problem - thoughts situations partner place etc. 6. do you get early morning or night erections? 7. if yes how frequent? 8. your marital status and partner details. 9. effect on your marriage or relationship so far. 10. details of any other medical illnesses. 11. medications you are receiving currently. 12. medications which you tried till date and their results. 13. any investigations done so far and if yes details of the same. as you know erectile dysfunction is a complex disorder it needs thorough evaluation for treatment. revert back to a sexologist online for further follow up --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am a 54 year old male,  married and have good general health and good sexual appetite.

"you cannot just request a tonsillectomy and have it done. it is really your insurance company that calls the shots anymore but your ent specialist would be the one who would need to justify the surgery. unfortunately tonsils stones alone may not meet the criteria for a tonsillectomy so the ent may need to be your advocate to see if it can be approved. there is nothing over the counter or non-surgical that would ""cure"" this disorder. gargling after each meal would limit the accumulation of debris that is getting trapped in your tonsils."	i have extremely pitted tonsils and i get tonsil stones every day. its taking a toll on my life. can i get them removed? . every day i have to take out these small to huge tonsil stones. water tastes bad now and i'm nervous that my breath is bad. 2 weeks ago i woke up with bleeding tonsils. urgent care said i had to wait for it to heal and wouldn't take my tonsils out unless i was getting infections. doctors have said that i have the worst tonsils they have ever seen but that i just need to drink more water or brush more. i have listened to everything but its getting worse. is there anybody else that can help me?

the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg whites more often should not increase the risk for heart disease.	in egg consuption how many a day is too many? . my dad is 72 and eats at least 21 eggs a week. he has heart disease (fh 44%) diabetes high cholesterol high bp lung problems among others. he's on lipitor plavix 2 bp pills morbic antivert buspar nexium albuterol inhaler. . his stomach is bad and most foods make it hurt but eggs don't. i know this is too many so what about egg whites?

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds very uncomfortable. it's true that antibiotics continue working for some time after you take the last dose. the length of time they keep working depends on the exact type of antibiotic. however at five weeks post-antibiotics you can rest assured they have long since exited your system. and it's very good news that a chest x-ray showed your lungs are clear of fluid. as you probably know pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. this is usually caused by a virus though it can also be caused by bacteria. the problem with either type of pneumonia is that it inflames and irritates your delicate lung tissue. and this irritation can linger even after the infection is gone. this probably explains why you continue to feel symptoms even though you no longer have pneumonia per se. i would suggest you continue to follow up regularly with the doctor who treated you. he or she should be able to better explain the factors that may be continuing to cause you discomfort. you deserve an explanation and your doctor is the person in the best position to tell you. wishing you well!	how long after finishing antibiotics for pneumonia should it take to feel better? . i finished the antibiotics for pneumonia 5 weeks ago and i am still having chest pain and tightness. i had a repeat chest x-ray 2 weeks ago and it was clear. i am currently on flovent (2x a day) and ventolin as needed (averaging 3-4x a day) to help with these symptoms but i feel like i haven't improved since i finished the antibiotics.

hi this is the information from your packet seems you did not read it. if this is the first time you are using this medication and you are not switching from another form of hormonal birth control (such as patch other birth control pills) take the first tablet in the pack on the first sunday following the beginning of your menstrual period or on the first day of your period. if your period begins on a sunday begin taking this medication on that day. for the first cycle of use only use an additional form of non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms spermicide) for the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy until the medication has enough time to work. if you start on the first day of your period you do not need to use back-up birth control the first week. if you have not read this as you can see you should have started on the first day of what would have been your next period you started a week early. and this is a serious answer. good luck	is it birth control or possible pregnancy? . birth control question.? . i had unprotected sex nov. 21 and then i started my birth control that following sunday nov. 22. i had completed a week of the birth control. my period was expected the week after but it never came. i have never missed a period and i have been on plenty of birth control. is this the work of the birth control or something else? i am on sprintec. serious answers only please.

legal? you would need to ask a lawyer that question but since i do not know the entire story behind this pain doctor to take your bottle and medication i suspect that he/she may feel that you are abusing or taking too much pain medications. perhaps there will be a consultation with your primary care doctor. since some pain patients tend to seek pain medication from multiple sources medical professionals have to be very careful as do the patients who may be taking more than recommended or diverting these controlled substances to others.	is it legal for my pain clinic doctor to take my medicine and the bottle it was in it was from my primary care dr.

a couple of weeks ago i ran to the grocery store to grab a few ingredients for a pasta dish i was making. i was reminded – as i was holding the last sad and wimpy two-dollar bunch of fresh basil in my hands – how an herb garden or pot can save you time and money. for about the same amount of cash i was able to buy a big pot of fresh basil and plant it in a big pot in my backyard… but this $2. 99 is the gift that keeps on giving. you don’t need much to make an herb garden or herb pot happen. you just need two square feet of patio or deck space and most of us have a big pot or two sitting idle in the back of the shed. now we can put this empty pot to work! add some dirt or potting soil then plant your favorite herbs. i planted a gob of basil some parsley and some sage for less than $10. you can start using them in your cooking immediately!	how can i save time and money with a pot of herbs?

i can understand your anxiety which is quite obvious in this situation. however transfer of the hiv virus through oral sex is low. but it depends on any cuts abrasion on your penis and any ulcer in her mouth. if this is possible then get a blood sample of her because that can be tested for hiv (human immunodeficiency virus). 14 days is a short period for acute hiv infection manifestation but still it is not a guarantee. if cost is not an issue then you can do hiv viral load which can detect viral rna within 10 days of infection. on personal ground i do not think that your symptoms are hiv related. these look more stress related. i will add that hiv is not the only infection you should be worried as you can get other std (sexually transmitted diseases) like hpv (human papilloma virus) syphilis and gonorrhea. as i said above you can do a hiv viral load test which can detect viral rna within 10 days of infection. also next time in addition to being careful i will say that you should present early because the drug useful for prevention is most active in the first 72 hours of exposure. for further information consult a general medicine physician online --> <link>	Hi doctor,Before 14 days, I had an encounter with a female escort. We had unprotected oral sex and protected vaginal sex. I am worried about the possibility of HIV as I am experiencing headaches. From day 4 or 5 post exposure, I have had a general malaise feeling in my head, feeling spaced out and slightly dizzy. I have also been having headaches. The headaches come and go and vary in strength. They are always located as a pain between my eyebrows in the procerus muscle. When I massage that part of my head, it goes away for a few seconds and again, last for a couple of hours or so. Most recently, one eye was twitching and was slightly puffy. The headache almost feels like the procerus muscle itself is tight and causing the pain. I have read that the procerus muscle headache is common in sinus infections, but I feel that my sinuses are all fine. I do not have a cold of any sort. I have no other typical HIV symptoms, so I am wondering could these types of headache occur through stress or anxiety? I have a fair bit of that just now.

one of my greatest pleasures in life is to help patients achieve remission of their type 2 diabetes. this means their blood sugar levels have become normal in the absence of any diabetes medication. many clinicians and patients are interested in learning my views about how to go about decreasing and discontinuing diabetes medications. the main role for medications is to help reduce or delay the risk of nasty complications of diabetes particularly the damage to the retina kidney nerves and circulation. the higher the average blood sugar level as indicated by the hemoglobin a1c level the greater the complication risk (which increases exponentially with increasing a1c). we know from clinical trials that using medication to keep the a1c at or below 7% can help reduce the risk of these complications. there is broad agreement that clinicians should recommend starting or increasing diabetes medications to patients who cannot get their a1c level to 7% or less via lifestyle change. many patients come to me because the a1c is already over 7% and their primary care provider proposes increasing their diabetes medication unless the patient can get to 7% or less with improved eating and/or exercise habits. some of these patients are already on many pills and insulin shots are the frequently the next appropriate treatment. many patients would rather make the lifestyle changes than take more medication so when the doctor frames the issue in this way then a patient might become inspired to renew or increase the lifestyle efforts. the clinician might say “let's recheck the a1c in three months and start the new medication if it is still above 7. 0%. ” there can be little doubt that using lifestyle changes to normalize the glucose levels and a1c is a good thing. in contrast the strategy of driving the a1c well below 7. 0% with multiple medications has little to offer most patients in terms of quality of life or reduced risk of complications. most patients i see are already taking metformin which is the preferred second-line treatment after lifestyle change. i typically recommend initiating it in patients with a1c’s of 6. 5% who cannot push it any lower via lifestyle change. for patients who are already on metformin i do not decrease the dose unless the a1c is 6. 0% or less. i might reduce the dose by half every three months as long as the a1c stays at 6. 0% or less. i stop the final 500 mg of metformin when the a1c is 6. 0% or less for at least three months. some drugs can lower the blood sugar levels below the normal range causing symptoms of hypoglycemia. these drugs which include insulin and those in the sulfonylurea family (which are common in patients on more than one kind of diabetes pill) need to be reduced or discontinued by the clinician as required to avoid hypoglycemia so these are typically the first drugs to be discontinued. it is important that patients who take these medications check their blood sugar levels regularly particularly while making lifestyle changes. doing so lets us know the risk of future hypoglycemia and guides the decision about when to decrease or discontinue such medications. in the absence of insulin or sulfonylureas then other drugs (such as pioglitizone) come off next. i typically wait until the a1c is 6. 5% or less to propose stopping such drugs and would not initiate or re-initiate any diabetes drugs (other than metformin as noted above) unless the a1c is above 7. 0%. so in summary ambitious eating and exercise goals are important in all stages of diabetes and drugs are crucially important in patients who cannot otherwise keep the a1c below 7. 0%. it is clear that medications can be avoided delayed or discontinued when lifestyle efforts are intensified and sustained. for many (if not most) patients lifestyle coaching by a clinician dietitian personal trainer peer group etc. can dramatically increase the odds of success. . the first step toward weaning oneself off type 2 diabetic (and almost all medication) is to change the lifestyle that got you to your state of poor health. diet is #1 in my book followed closely by exercise. one can diet all they want and achieve good results but unless you are willing to commit to a change in your lifestyle of eating and or exercise you are wasting your time! you stop eating right you stop exercising right and soon you will be back to where you started sick! 18 yrs ago i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. for 16 of those years i took pills dieted i exercised but never could get this monkey off my back. in fact at one point i gave up and said ok like the doc said you have genetically caused diabetes so learn to live with it! i ballooned to 240 lbs suffered with high blood pressure hi triglycerides and taking the max dosage of lantus and the max dose of metformin. i used the gym on a regular basis but never could get my a1c even to 7. 0! then i discovered a lifestyle of eating that turned all that around. i am at 155lbs now and off all meds and will never go back to eating what people increasingly realizing is the cause of all our health problems the sad american diet! full of additives fructose syrups sugars processed grains processed meats. . once we started to cook with and use unprocessed foods cut out all the “fast foods” junk foods like ice cream all processed grains all fat cuts of meat and ate mostly fresh or fresh cooked veggies and fresh or fresh cooked fruits lots of nuts and seeds (like sunflower). my a1c was 6. 1 my totasl cholesterol was 144 and my b/p 105/65 with a perfect full blood profile in december! step 1 is to make up your mind to take control of your eating and get the unhealthy state of your body turned around. step 2 is make sure you get plenty of exercise get off your duff and walk run join the gym (and go there). if you are handicapped see your doctor about getting help! step 3. (and most important) permanently change your lifestyle of eating. most diabetics can decrease their meds simply by eating the right foods. eventually if you stay on your new lifestyle your insulin resistance will start decreasing and with this you can wean yourself off all med! blood pressure cholesterol diabetic etc. step4. vow never to go back to the lifestyle that got you to type 2 diabetes clogged arteries whatever your health situation was! my recommendation for a lifestyle change is the route i took to heart that really made a difference in my health! they call it the ph diet (you will learn if you read most any of the many books on this they will call it a lifestyle because diets do not work! remember you did something wrong to get you where you are change it and don’t do it again ever! ps: i am now off all meds for any health problem!	what are the steps for weaning off diabetes medication?

it seems you are suffering from reflux and gastritis which is a common issue after gall bladder removal. regarding the abnormal feeling it requires a clinical examination to comment regarding the exact cause. it might be that the incision site is healing which can cause some hardening of the involved and surrounding region. the simple measures that are likely to help you are- 1. certain foods such as cauliflower broccoli cabbage brussels sprouts and legumes (beans) may cause bloating and gassiness. 2. dietary fiber may lessen symptoms. you should drink plenty of water and avoid soda which may cause gas and abdominal discomfort. 3. you can use some over the counter drugs like pepto bismol or tums for symptomatic relief. consider visiting the treating surgeon once for evaluation. take care!	its been since august 15 2012 and i have had issues. the incision in my bellybutton keeps spliting open infection. my dr. told me no it is not infection! did nothing! everything i try to eat even (one) bite. it feels like a rubber band is snapping inside! when i sleep on my left side everything on the right settles i feel something moving! there is an egg sized (? ) in the center between my navel and ribs. what could possibly cause the snapping feeling and what could possibly be moving inside me? kind of freaked out especially when my dr. who is a ta says nothing is wrong. i was 110 when this all began i am under 100 lbs i am 5ft 5in and nothing tastes good smells good and i'm nausious all the time.

that’s a good question. fees are negotiable. now not every practice buys into that but i think that the practices that are very customer oriented consumer oriented they see value and let me tell you what this fee negotiation is. it’s not like begging for a lower fee. there’s a reason that would serve both the patient and the practice to have a lower fee. example the concept of stand-by airfare in the good old days of air travel airlines would sell you a cheap seat relatively cheap seat and you came to the airline and waited around and oh yeah we got an empty seat somebody didn’t show up and bingo they’ll give you half off. that’s how we as students traveled a lot student stand-by. it doesn’t quite exist in the airline industry they’ve overcome that with their computers they have no empty seats. but if a patient says you know can i save some money then a reasonable answer from our practice would be well are you flexible on when you could come in and have your nose job or have your eyelids. in other words you have the kind of job you have the kind of life that allows that because occasionally somebody’s on the schedule and they call up a week before and they say you know what i have a cold or my kid is sick or i’ve got to go out of town or my job says i can’t take the time off. so now there’s a vacancy created on a schedule that’s been set for months ahead. so the surgery center has a seat open just like the airline has a seat open. the anesthesiologist he’s there he’s ready to work the surgery center is ready to work and we’ve committed that time. i haven’t scheduled a golf game that afternoon. so the answer is you bet we’ll give you a discount if you can slide in and take the space. nothing wrong with it it’s perfectly legitimate for the patient to have a monetary advantage for being flexible enough to give us efficiency of our operation. 50 i mean accounts and business people think that’s just the best way to run it and we agree so that’s one way. the other is let’s say you want to have something done and your sister’s got the nose that she doesn’t like and your cousin has one. if all three of the ladies come in together consult together and agree to have the procedures they are eligible for what we call a family and friends discount because we’re going to be spending less time teaching on an individual basis. because if we’re all sitting in a room and discussing the same procedures it’s a lot more efficient for us. and so basically we can pass that savings on and the post operative care is easy because frankly one tells the other what it’s all about and so it’s about being more efficient in our practice so people are entitled to have some benefit from that. you can also save money if you plan your operation far enough in advance and use the christmas lay-away concept where every month you send the practice a check and by the 11th month you’ve already paid the practice so the normal 12th month payment would be free. i mean it’s just again what department stores have done so successfully because there again they are banking your money. but if you’ve got the money set aside you can wind up paying less by essentially paying it far in advance of the time of surgery because everybody does pay for the procedures you know usually two weeks ahead of time but you have to pay 6 months or a year ahead of time unless you are granted a courtesy discount. now these are concepts that come from the business world but it’s not unprofessional to do it. but it’s not the same as shopping for the lowest price by walking into a clinic and saying dr. so and so will do my nose for $8 000 will you do it for $7 200? that unless again you’re willing to go on the reserve list in other words it has to be a win-win. but service will be the same by the way. i mean people that have the benefit of a discount don’t get a lesser result. now when you’re talking about the three women you’re not talking about putting them and doing all of their noses in the same operation? same day they could do it. as a matter of fact if they do that again there will be an even greater savings because that introduces tremendous efficiencies into the system. they could all recover at the same recovery facility share a room. they save money there. so i mean we know how to save people money without cutting quality. it’s just you have to think like a consumer. the patient needs to think like a consumer. they are buying a service. it’s a high quality service delivered by a conscientious professional but when it comes down to the dollars and cents of it hey as long as everybody’s happy nothing’s wrong with saving a few bucks and we’re glad to do it.	is there a way to save money on my cosmetic procedure?

in some cases yes. it would depend on which antidepressant and which diet pills you are referring to. any diet pill that contains a stimulant can be dangerous if you are taking an antidepressant that is stimulating. the two mixed together can lead to a rapid heartbeat mood swings and even stroke or heart attack. before taking any weight-loss supplement you should check with your doctor or pharmacist to ensure it is safe for you.	can mixing antidepressants and diet pills cause serious side effects?
you usually treat ringworm of the scalp or beard with antifungal pills prescribed by a doctor. shampoos available without a prescription are helpful if you use them along with prescription pills. but when they are used alone they cannot completely destroy all of the fungi causing the infection. if you have ringworm of the scalp or beard: be sure to complete the full course of any prescribed medicine or follow the directions for products available without a prescription. they often require use for a period of time after symptoms go away. wash your hair or beard 2 or 3 times a week with shampoo that contains selenium sulfide or ketoconazole. in severe scalp fungal infections wash your scalp daily and wear a cap. you should boil the cap after you use it. 2 as soon as you start treatment throw away your combs and brushes and buy new ones. you will most likely see your doctor again after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. your doctor will also want to see you after you have finished all your medicine. follow the suggestions for preventing ringworm such as keeping your skin clean and dry and not sharing hats combs or brushes with others. ask your doctor whether your family members need to be tested. family members can use an antifungal shampoo with selenium sulfide in it (such as selsun blue or head and shoulders intensive treatment) to prevent the spread of infection. you do not need to keep your child out of school if he or she is taking pills to treat ringworm of the scalp. although parents sometimes use a special shampoo to help prevent the spread to other children it is not needed. and you do not need to shave your child's head. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what can i do to treat ringworm of the scalp or beard at home?
potato cakes seem like a strange thing to write about especially on a site dedicated to health. i had a grandmother who made really unappetizing potato cakes when i was growing up so i discounted them for years. what i’ve come to realize is that they can be a healthy fantastic side dish to almost any meal. i had potato cakes on the menu this weekend with our fish special at catelli’s restaurant and they were so delicious versatile and surprisingly healthy. first start with organic yukon gold potatoes or sweet potatoes or a combination of the two. decide if you want to add vegetables like shredded zucchini. i start by shredding the potatoes on a blade in the cuisinart or by grating them on a box grater. next take a bowl and toss the potatoes with fresh herbs. there are plenty that add great flavor… rosemary and thyme are two of my favorites. add savories like shallot onion and garlic. (i like to sauté my finely chopped onion and garlic first in a bit of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of hot pepper flakes. ) put the shredded potatoes herbs and vegetable in a bowl and fold in the cooked onions and garlic. then season with salt and cracked black pepper. heat the oven 450 degrees. from there line a baking sheet with parchment paper and for each cake make about a cupcake-size mass. spread them out equally on the sheet pan. drizzle a bit more olive oil on top for extra browning and then bake for about 15-20 minutes. these cakes a great side dish with all proteins are really simple to make. they make weeknight meals into something more interesting and you can be as creative or simple as you want. a few additional ideas: add cilantro and chopped jalapeno for a latin flair. add some parmesan and extra garlic to a cake with rosemary. crushed coriander and some curry powder can lend to indian flavors. whatever you choose to do have fun with it.	how can i prepare potatoes healthfully?
welcome to icliniq. com. the best oral hygiene maintenance method is to brush your teeth with a soft or medium toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. the electronic toothbrush does not offer any real additional benefit to normal individuals. it is the movements of the toothbrush made by our hands that bring about thorough cleaning. most of the toothpastes available in the market are good as long as they contain up to 1000 ppm fluoride. brushing three times is good. the main goal is to clean the food deposits from all areas. rinsing the mouth after meals is good yet a simple method to keep the mouth clean. using a mouthwash causes no real problem in relation to upsetting the microflora or healthy bacteria. you can continue to use it once a day. professional cleaning is recommended every 6 to 12 months depending on your plaque and calculus forming tendency. due to plaque deposition over a long period there is temporary decalcification that might occur on the tooth surface. thus on professional cleaning when it is removed there will a slight increased sensitivity. however it does not remove the enamel layer at a significant level. so once we continue to use the fluoride toothpaste with a toothbrush along with natural fluoride in water the tooth surface gets remineralized. and then the sensitivity disappears. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,How many times a day should I brush my teeth? I recently bought an electronic toothbrush with five modes. I am not new to electronic toothbrushes. I brush my teeth in sensitive mode and I used to wash them three times a day after having food. Sometimes, especially after I had my teeth cleaned professionally, I experience sensitivity. I do not want to get my enamel wear off. Is it correct to wash my teeth three times a day? Or should I do it only two times a day? Should I use mouthwash at night? I am using a product without alcohol. I read that it might upset the mouth's natural bacterial environment, although it helps preserve teeth. Is that correct?

the whole concept of estrogen replacement therapy was about that. the only difficulty is the side consequences of doing that potentially putting women at risk of heart disease. so there are foods naturally rich in phytoestrogens that may help keep skin nice and supple. soy is a good source. beans and legumes are generally high in phytoestrogens. flax too. the key with those foods is not to wait until you turn 50 to suddenly start eating them. start earlier eating moderate amounts of those foods.	does hormone replacement therapy help slow down aging?

i'm sorry you're going through this. it's always scary when we have a problem with our eyes! the first thing to clarify is this: is it your actual eyeball that's twitching? or is it your eyelid? twitching of the eyelid is called blepharospasm and is quite common. it tends to come and go as you described. it can get worse and more frequent from time to time and then clear up for long periods. stress fatigue and caffeine are common culprits of blepharospasm. if it's your eyeball that's twitching that would be more worrisome to me. when a person's eyeballs twitch it's usually both of them. if your eyeball itself is the problem i'd advise you to see a doctor. i realize you said you don't have insurance but most communities have free or low-cost health care clinics. you could start by getting checked at one of those just to calm any fears you may have about this situation. i wish you all the best!	why is my right eyeball twitching? . started almost a year ago. very random. it has gotten more and more frequent over the last few weeks. now its more than a few times a day. no redness or swelling or tearing or any other symptoms. i do have astigmatism and when it does twitch my vision blurs slightly. no insurance though so i cannot even have it checked out til march. worried it could be something serious. would appreciate some advice.

hi this is from matthew hoffman md here on webmd. hope its the answer your looking for. it’s uncommon (though not unheard of) for shingles to affect the external area around the vagina called the vulva. it’s very unusual for shingles to affect the inside of the vagina itself but it can occur. shingles is the common name for herpes zoster the painful rash that results from reactivation of varicella virus in adulthood. most of us are infected by varicella virus as children when it causes chickenpox. after we recover from chickenpox varicella doesn’t disappear but rather goes dormant hiding inside nerves under our skin for years. later in life varicella can erupt on the skin to cause the painful rash called herpes zoster or shingles. (varicella is in the herpes virus family but is distinct from hsv-1 and hsv-2 the herpes viruses that commonly affect the lips and genitals. ) varicella is much more likely to affect external skin than moist mucous membranes inside the mouth or vagina. ulcers or sores on the vagina are more often due to hsv-1 or hsv-2 (herpes infections). taking a viral culture from the site of a fresh ulcer is the only way to know for sure though. do hope this helps you. good luck	does shingle vaccine help with herpes? i was diagnosed with herpes is it possible for shingles to appear in vaginal area. have not had a herpes outbreak for many years not sexually active yet recently have developed what appears to be herpes outbreak much worse than any before. usually when there was an outbreak it was limited to one spot this time it's at least three

"i had basically the same thing happen to me. i was driving in high holiday traffic during december on the bqe in nyc for my nieces' baptism. all of a sudden i was going numb on left side of my face and scalp as well as feeling weak but had no pain. then bam my eyesight went and came back. i panicked and managed to pull over. i had no idea what was happening to me. i thought i was having a stroke and my heart was racing because i panicked. so it felt like a heart attack. my boyfriend drove us the rest of the way and i went to the er to be checked out. i had an mri cat scan echo blood drawn for tests etc. i was vamped pricked and prodded by 4 different doctors. then the neurologist saw me and said he thinks i had an atypical complex migraine headache and a mild panic attack. i was told to avoid several things. all of which lead to migraine headaches and for me most are not avoidable but some are. thing such as chocolate too much sleep too little sleep caffeine stress alcohol smoking extreme fatigue skipping meals and bright or flickering lights. you better believe that the things this doctor listed pretty much was like a check list for my 6 hour drive. i worked a 10 hour shift skipped dinner drank 4 20 oz cups of coffee and had a chocolate bar all while arguing over navigation issues with the bf. also was stressing because i was the god mother and if we were late to the church my sister would never forgive me. i was also surprised to learn that when i would get stressed at work i would get a mild headache with a tick or fluttering eye muscle and ""floaters"" in my eye and that it was a migraine but with out the pain. i now keep a headache or migraine diary and try to figure out what my triggers are. the biggest ones for me are sleep stress and caffeine. just know that you aren't alone in this and you might never even have another one again. it helps to just take care of yourself and avoid caffeine/stress."	what are complex migrains. i had an incident at work where my right arm went numb i had problem speaking for a few seconds and felt like i might faint. i was in the hospital for 5 days undergoing stroke tests. i was diagnosed with complex migrains and was told that it produces stroke symptoms. what exactly or as close as i can get is a complex migraine and how can i treat it without medication?

"the symptoms of depression in children vary. it is often undiagnosed and untreated because they are passed off as normal emotional and psychological changes that occur during growth. early medical studies focused on ""masked"" depression where a child's depressed mood was evidenced by acting out or angry behavior. while this does occur particularly in younger children many children display sadness or low mood similar to adults who are depressed. the primary symptoms of depression revolve around sadness a feeling of hopelessness and mood changes. signs and symptoms of depression in children include: irritability or anger continuous feelings of sadness hopelessness social withdrawal increased sensitivity to rejection changes in appetite -- either increased or decreased changes in sleep -- sleeplessness or excessive sleep vocal outbursts or crying difficulty concentrating fatigue and low energy physical complaints (such as stomachaches headaches) that do not respond to treatment reduced ability to function during events and activities at home or with friends in school extracurricular activities and in other hobbies or interests feelings of worthlessness or guilt impaired thinking or concentration thoughts of death or suicide not all children have all of these symptoms. in fact most will display different symptoms at different times and in different settings. although some children may continue to function reasonably well in structured environments most kids with significant depression will suffer a noticeable change in social activities loss of interest in school and poor academic performance or a change in appearance. children may also begin using drugs or alcohol especially if they are over the age of 12. although relatively rare in youths under 12 young children do attempt suicide -- and may do so impulsively when they are upset or angry. girls are more likely to attempt suicide but boys are more likely to actually kill themselves when they make an attempt. children with a family history of violence alcohol abuse or physical or sexual abuse are at greater risk for suicide as are those with depressive symptoms."	how can i tell if my child is depressed?

there's a lot going on at puberty that could be contributing to your daughter's weight eating and cholesterol. first off weight gain especially around the middle for girls is normal and to be expected as she is going through the second largest growth spurt of her life. but if she is not being fed well balanced meals at regular intervals excess weight and unhealthy habits can occur. also this is a time when iron deficiency risk increases with the onset of regular periods which can cause low energy. i suggest you visit her doctor and get blood work done including iron levels to check to see if she is deficient. second providing regular balanced meals at the table and involving her in meal preparation should help get her eating on track. regular physical activity is important too. but please avoid dieting and making weight an issue as research shows it backfires. for more on healthy eating during the teen years see this webmd article.	my 14 yr old daughter has high cholesterol but normal triglycerides. also rapid weight gain at puberty stretch mark. her body seems puffed much like someone who is overfed starches. her legs and arms are also hard not fatty at all. as soon as puberty hit she rapidly gained weight and has numerous stretch marks. her energy level is also low.
postural hypotension is a common cause of an episode of temporary loss of consciousness or feelings of lightheadedness. postural hypotension results from changing body position from a prone supine or sitting position to a more vertical position. normally blood tends to pool in the legs due to gravity when a person stands up potentially reducing the amount of blood available to return to the heart. nerves to the blood vessels in the legs normally act to compensate for this pooling by constricting thus sending blood away from the leg veins and toward the heart. however poor tone of the nerves to blood vessels in the legs can cause this mechanism to fail resulting in a disproportionate distribution of blood to the legs instead of returning to the circulation so the brain receives less oxygen. as a result a person feels lightheaded and may even faint.	what is postural hypotension (orthostatic hypotension)?

"hm. you raise an interesting question. it's true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis. it helps to understand that osteoarthritis (which is what we're talking about here) doesn't necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint (which is what a lot of people think). technically ""osteoarthritis"" refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully. we usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue. osteoarthritis is called the ""wear and tear"" disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other. however the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma (such as a broken bone). i'd suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define ""arthritis"" for you so that you understand better what they're talking about. they should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly. i hope this information helps! i happened to be in the same boat as you except i now know for sure i have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrist's range of motion. i fractured my wrist twice. first time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago. although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture. it only took one year for my wrist to develope arthritis to the extend that the only solution now is fusion withtitanium. i have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to catlidge soon develope arthritis. in your case i think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where joint/cartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps muli-range function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to arthritis due trauma. physical therapy is very important after the bone heals. age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of arthritis is less. what triggers arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set. do get second and third openion from expert surgeons. good luck had this happen to me did the fussion 3 times and they all failed. i am type 2 diabetic so that could have something to do with it. get second opinions you could end up like me disabled for the rest of my life."	how fast can arthritis develope in a broken foot. i broke my left foot over a year ago and am still having problems. i've been told it is arthritis and nothing can be done except fuse the foot. what no one can or will tell me is why no problem before breaking the foot but after breaking it i suddenly have arthritis? can it develop that fast? i feel like the doctors and insurance nurse just want me to go away. thank you.
"sure they can eat it but should they? probably when you were young your mother gave cereal at an early age but now we like to keep babies on formula or breast milk until age six months. breast milk and formula does clear the stomach quickly so it is not unusual for children to act hungry in 2-3 hours again. of course your baby doesn't make it that long. she is a big girl however and as a rule of thumb babies should double their birth weight by age six months. i don't know what she weighed at birth but i suspect she is close to doing it already. i would suggest that you get the ""okay"" from your baby's pediatrician before doing so."

olive oil is a fat and like any fat contains about 100 calories per tablespoon. so keep in mind: olive oil is just as caloric as other fats and can contribute to weight gain if consumed in high amounts. olive oil does contain heart-healthy fats which are associated with lower blood cholesterol levels. but you can't just pour olive oil all over an otherwise unhealthy diet and expect your cholesterol levels to suddenly go down. making dietary changes to control your cholesterol levels is a twofold process. first increase the amount of fiber in your diet such as the fiber found in oatmeal fruits and vegetables. second decrease the amount of animal fats and saturated fats you consume such as the fats found in butter whole milk cream sausage bacon and heavily marbled cuts of beef. exercise is also good for your heart health and cardiovascular function. but you have to address any issues with your diet. i suggest using olive oil-based cooking sprays to sauté your vegetables as well as using olive oil as a salad dressing base. canola oil is a good choice as well.	i want to know if adding olive oil to my diet could help lower my cholesterol.

my sister recently went to the doctor for a trigger finger. she was told to use a cold compress for 30 minute intervals for 3 days. she had already bought an over the counter splint to keep the finger straight the doctor told her to continue using it though i think she only wore it at night. i have always been told that whatever makes you more comfortable heat or cold is what you should use. i cannot tolerate cold it seems to make pain worse. i crushed my leg when i had an accident 10 years ago and it required a 7 hour surgery to be put back together with rods plates & screws with several follow up surgeries. while in the hospital the surgeon wanted ice to be put on it but after seeing the pain it caused & the reaction for the cold he changed the treatment to heat which helped more. i would use whatever gives the most relief. i hope your finger feels better soon! my sisters did after a week.	is a hot or cold compress good for a trigger finger?
hi how lucky you are to have your very own toaster so she feels cold but is hot you cant give her meds for that its her system its the way it works. if you love this women then your just going to have to live with it your never need an electric blanket. its just her metabolism don't play with it. hope this helps you. good luck	my fiancee is really cold natured but her body radiates a bunch of heat. sometimes it's not that bad but other times. it's almost unbearable to cuddle up face to face. she's not sick i don't think. . because she's cold natured she's freezing while i'm suffocating from her body heat. maybe her blood vessels are opening up next to the skin to radiate heat when her body doesn't need to so her internal body heat radiates out making her too cold inside. would something to constrict the blood vessels help? stimulants wouldn't be good since she'd need to take them right before bed. <negative_smiley>. what's causing this? any ideas?
it is best to ask your health care provider how soon you can begin your exercise routine after delivering your baby. although you may be eager to get in shape quickly return to your pre-pregnancy fitness routines gradually. follow your health care provider's exercise recommendations. most women can safely perform a low-impact activity one to two weeks after a vaginal birth (or three to four weeks after a cesarean birth). do about half of your normal floor exercises and don't try to overdo it.	how soon can i exercise after having my baby?

hi just done a bit more searching what’s below come from this site www. urologyhealth. org can a change in diet or herbal remedies prevent or cure a yeast infection? scientists do not know why fungal infections develop in some individuals and not others. they also are not sure just how diet might impact the problem or herbal remedies help it. but they do know that diabetic patients have an increased vulnerability to these infections leading them to suggest that anyone diagnosed with diabetes should avoid high carbohydrate diets. yogurt may provide normal microorganisms for the genitourinary tract so many advocate it as a preventative measure or treatment of yeast infections. a few of things i forgot keep out of jeans and slacks same with tights wear just lose cotton knickers go without when you can and shave off your pubic hair this last bit is because yi dose love a nice warm moist area to live in so without any hair you could shut the door to them. and this last bit is from www. yeastinfection. org 3. those suffering a long time: if you’re in the third group you’ve been suffering for a very long time ten years or more. it feels like you’ve tried everything under the sun and you’ve probably spent hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars on products that just don’t work. you’ve lost a ton of money and sadly a huge chunk of your life. i’ve seen many patients like this over the years and have built my reputation on turning many of these cases around. it’s what get’s me up in the morning and makes me feel excited to be able to give people the opportunity to achieve amazing results at their own hands with the right information and encouragement. if you are in the group of people who hasn’t had a diagnosis you probably think i’m making this up; or at least “fluffing up” the details a bit. the truth though is that i’ve spent the past 25 years of my career as a naturopathic physician talking to thousands of people who feel like their lives have been ruined. these are just a few of the stories i’ve heard. i wasn’t kidding when i said i’ve heard countless stories just like this – from men and women alike. when a candida overgrowth gets to the point where it’s wreaking havoc with your entire body you may ultimately become so ill and beat that you just can’t seem to function. it’s difficult to work because you constantly feel fuzzy headed anxious and depressed sick to your stomach and sensitive to just about any food chemical or toxin you come into contact with. it’s not just adults who are too sick to build their careers further their educations or have fun with family and friends either. a number of the parents i’ve worked with have brought their children to see me. in some cases i can trace the path of candida in children all the way back to birth. during the birthing process when a baby should be getting nutrients and good bacterial flora from his mother these children contracted yeast instead. instead of growing stronger they remained compromised as their condition worsened with age. and when they became unwell what would the doctor prescribe? you guessed it more antibiotics. these may help as well. good luck	intercourse and all of my past and current partners always complain of a vaginal infection/yest infection. for the past 5-7 years it seems every time i have intercourse with my partner i seem to give them or they seem to get a vaginal infection. the only time it they dont seem to get any type of infection is when we use condoms or if we spend 15 mins cleaning myself down there and then using rubbing alcohol on it before intercourse. . i have been tested multiple times and they cant find anything wrong with me. they have been tested multiple times also and the only thing they can find is a yeast infecti

it is important to eat nutritious and well-balanced meals throughout your pregnancy. you will need to increase your intake of certain vitamins and minerals including iron calcium and folic acid. also it's generally recommended that women consume between 100 and 300 calories more per day while pregnant. try to limit the amount of sweets and junk food you eat as they offer mostly empty calories with little to no nutritional value. i read somewhere that brain development is key in the 3rd tri- so try to get omega 3s. with limits on fish intake i'm trying buy omega 3 enhanced eggs and milk (but i'm also eating low mercury fish like shrimp a few times / week).	are there any nutrients that i should be getting more of as my pregnancy progresses?

"the short answer is: yes. unfortunately you have exposed yourself to genital herpes. it doesn't matter that the cold sore was scabbed over or that the lip lesion ""barely touched"" your penis. a person with herpes can spread the virus even when it's not active. your girlfriend's herpes most definitely was active since she had a lesion. this does not mean you positively will develop genital herpes but you're flirting with disaster. you need to take better precautions in the future. there is no cure for genital herpes. if you do develop genital herpes you absolutely must disclose the fact to your partners before you have sex with them. they have a right to decide whether or not to risk getting the virus from you. and while condom use is good be aware a condom won't necessarily protect you from herpes because the virus can reside in groin areas that aren't covered by the sheath. i'm not sure how old you are but you may want to read this article about the rise in genital herpes transmission among us teens due to having oral sex with an infected partner. even if you're not a teenager the same scenario applies to your story. please stop engaging in unsafe sex. always use a condom. don't have any type of sexual relations with a person who obviously has a virus that can become a sexually transmitted disease. you owe it to yourself and your sexual partners to be responsible about your sexual practices. wishing you well!"	can a cold sore give me genital herpes? . recently my girlfriend gave me a blowjob. she had a cold sore on her lower lip. although the sore was completely scabbed over and is almost completely healed. she got it two weeks ago and has been using some type of medicine to get it healed. the bj lasted 15 seconds and the scab barely touched my penis. the sore isn't open at all so is there still a high risk of infection? whenever we make-out when she has a cold sore i never get one. and she generally gets them when she's really stressed.
it is likely not much will change with your plan. insurance plans that existed before the affordable care act (aca) are considered “grandfathered plans” and are not subject to reform. employer-based plans that change substantially must comply with the aca by instituting new insurance reforms such as not excluding individuals with pre-existing conditions and banning lifetime limits on coverage. beginning in 2015 businesses with 50 or more employees must make their plans affordable for their employees or face a penalty. if the monthly premiums cost more than 9. 5 percent of your income it is considered unaffordable. small businesses employing 50 or fewer people are still not required to offer insurance but they can continue to offer it if they currently do. alternatively they may also join their state’s health insurance exchange and purchase insurance through it. it is possible that the mix of new penalties and incentives under health reform will lead some employers to drop coverage altogether but it is very difficult to determine at this point whether this will occur and how many workers it may impact. if this does occur the good news is that there will be some new options as i mentioned previously for many more individuals—including expanded medicaid offerings and new marketplaces called health insurance “exchanges. ”	how will health reform affect employees who currently have insurance through their employer?

unfortunately i have no way of determining if the conditioner might be the cause since i do not know what you are using and of course i have no way of examining the sores on your scalp. you have two options: see your primary care provider or see a dermatologist. take the conditioner with you to that visit. my choice would be the dermatologist since they are skin experts and may be able to solve this chronic scalp problem.	i have sores on my scalp and think conditioner is the cause. for a couple years i have had small sores dotting my scalp that can be itchy especially if i go a day without washing my hair or after i dye it. my grandmother has a similar condition and she believes that using conditioner while washing is a cause. she has stopped using conditioner and i think her sores have gone away. i cannot stop using conditioner because my hair becomes very dry and brittle when i do not use it. but i am not sure if conditioner is the exact cause to the sores.
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it just goes to show how negatively pain can impact so many aspects of our lives. i commend you for being committed to your sexual health and marital relationship. you're a good wife for wanting to build that intimacy back up! i'd suggest you start by assessing what non-sexual positions are the most comfortable for you. for example if sitting in a chair provides relief try adapting that for a sexual purpose. have your husband sit on a chair and then sit on your husband if that makes sense. another suggestion is to try having sex in a water environment such as the shower or a bathtub. this may be especially helpful if warm water gives you pain relief. just be careful nobody slips! you may simply have to experiment to find positions that work for you. do not be shy about seeking out aids such as swings or slings that suspend from the ceiling if you need something like that to help take pressure off your back during sex. a less expensive and less permanent solution may involve plenty of pillows to prop and support body parts. again experimentation is going to be key here. if you feel shy about expressing your feelings or needs to your partner please don't hesitate to consult your doctor a nurse or a psychotherapist who's experienced in sexual health to help with communication and to help you find solutions. believe me they will understand your concerns and treat you with utmost respect. all the best to you! i lay on the edge of the bed on my back. hubby stands next to bed and pulls me towards him. if your husband is tall you can use pillows to adjust height. my husband has a bad back and this is a good position for him also. for oral sex i sit on the floor or pillow with my back against the bed. this supports my neck. hi ok try this but i do take laying on your back is ok lift your right leg up your hubby swings his right leg over and he can then enter you from here you rest your right leg on him from here he can have sex with you he can play with your breasts and nipples and why having sex he can massage your clitoris or you can orgasm city here you come. do hope this helps you. good luck	are there any sexual postion that you could suggest that are less painful for chronic neck and back pain? . i do not move around too well walking is even sometimes very difficult. we are not having sex too often because he can see the pain it causes me. i need to find a position that is comfortable for me that will not put pressure or weight on my neck or back. i cannot lean on my side because that also causes pain. please give me suggestions so we could have our sex life back again and build the intimacy back we once had.

she needs help starting with her pediatrician. many children of her age have explosive outbursts and there are medications that can help. additionally she could see a child psychiatrist or counselor for behavior therapy. tantrums can occur at any age but by age 7 she certainly should know that she is not in charge of the world and how do deal with conflicts in a more civilized manner. i don't have enough information to comment on her head pain but this should be carefully evaluated by the pediatrician as well including consideration for some imaging studies. rarely brain lesions can surface as personality aberrations so this may need to be ruled out.	my 7 year old daughter has temper tantrums! . my 7 yr old daughter has awful tantrums that have been happening more often. they occur in the mornings before school & other times they happen in the evening. they spark from not wanting to wear a coat to not liking what we have for dinner. she cries screams kicks throws things & even swings at me. they continue for at least 30 minutes and at the end she always cries that her head hurts. i give her some ibuprofen and then she settles down. . this doesnt seem normal to me. any advice would help.

colorectal cancer happens when cells that are not normal grow in your colon or rectum. these cells grow together and form tumors. this cancer is also called colon cancer or rectal cancer. it is the third most common cancer in the united states. and it occurs most often in people older than 50. when it is found early it is easily treated and often cured. but because it usually is not found early it is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the united states. 1 screening tests can prevent this cancer but fewer than half of people older than 50 are screened. according to the american cancer society if everyone were tested tens of thousands of lives could be saved each year. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what is colorectal cancer?
i researched one of the many don-drowsy decongestants drixoral (generic name- pseudoephedrine ) on drugs. com. some brand names for this medicine include: chlor trimeton non-drowsy contac cold nasofed seudotabs siledrine sudefed and found in many other non-drowsy decongestants. some of the serious side-effects to be listed on their label include: fast pounding or uneven heartbeat severe dizziness or anxiety dangerously high blood pressure anxiety confusion fast- pounding or uneven heartbeat and severe dizziness. less serious side effects include: loss of appetite feeling restless or excited and sleep problems insomnia) a label warning states: avoid taking this medication if you also take diet pills caffeine pills or other stimulants (such as adhd medications). taking a stimulant together with a decongestant can increase your risk of unpleasant side effects. summary: this particular non-drowsy decongest seems to have similar properties and side effects seen in other non-drowsy decongestants; your husband’s sleep experience was more than likely due to the non-drowsy decongestant that he consumed; your characterization of the non-drowsy decongestant as possibly being stimulating seems to be a reasonable conclusion; and i would not take this type of medication during the evening hours prior to bedtime.	is it ok to take decongestants at bedtime? . i have a generic non-drowsy nasal decongestant from cvs and my husband is convinced it kept him awake when he took it with cold symptoms. i don't think its supposed to act as a stimulant is it?

hi i found this info at <link> read through it may just interest you. herpes zoster also called shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus. this is the virus that causes chickenpox. sometimes many years after you have had chickenpox the varicella-zoster virus becomes active again and causes shingles. shingles is an infection that produces fluid-filled blisters on the skin often near certain nerves. it may spread to the eyes. if the varicella-zoster virus spreads to nerves in your head your face eyes and nose may be affected. the virus can cause several problems including: blisters on or inside your eyelids damage to your cornea (the clear dome on the front of the eye) uveitis (inflammation to eye tissues behind the cornea) glaucoma (increased pressure inside the eye) cataracts. several medicines are helpful in treating herpes zoster eye infections. acyclovir is an antiviral medicine that greatly limits the effects of the virus and helps reduce complications. this medicine is most effective when started as soon as the first symptoms appear. steroids can sometimes be used to reduce eye inflammation. antibiotics prevent infection from other organisms that may get in your eyes while you have herpes zoster. painkillers (such as acetaminophen) and lubricating eye drops may lessen your pain. medicines for glaucoma help keep the pressure in your eye at normal levels. blisters dry up and form scabs about 5 days after they appear. you may develop permanent scars and longstanding pain numbness or skin discoloration. if your cornea is affected it can become permanently scarred. early treatment with acyclovir lessens the effects of the varicella-zoster virus and can sometimes prevent serious complications. shingles can be recurring problem. his sounds very similar ti what you say? so do hope this helps you. good luck	what causes blisters on the inside of the eyelid and how can i prevent it and cure it? . i have diabetes anemia and cirrhosis of the liver. and in ausust i had to have a blood transfusion because of the severity of the anemia. i have in the past couple of months been getting blisters on the inside on my eyelids. they sometimes become so infected that it is painful and crusts over and swells almost to the point of closing. what causes them and how can i prevent this? what can i do to make the go away?

symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning range from mild flu -like symptoms (such as a headache or stomachache without fever ) to severe signs of heart and brain damage. prolonged exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide over many days may result in death. people respond differently to the same level of carbon monoxide. because of this carbon monoxide poisoning can range from mild to severe in different people with the same level of exposure. a person who has mild symptoms usually does not even suspect carbon monoxide poisoning. early symptoms can mimic the flu or a number of other conditions with similar symptoms which can make it difficult for a doctor to diagnose. it is possible that a person with more severe poisoning may not even be aware of the seriousness of the condition because the exposure to carbon monoxide may cause fatigue and confusion. if a person has symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning or if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected first get the person out of the polluted area and then call. symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often similar to symptoms of other illnesses. these symptoms include: 2 headache. nausea vomiting (often seen in children). dizziness. fatigue. more severe symptoms may include: confusion drowsiness. rapid breathing or pulse rate. vision problems. chest pain. convulsions seizures. loss of consciousness. symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning change with different blood concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin ( hemoglobin that has bonded with carbon monoxide instead of oxygen). some situations may provide clues to carbon monoxide exposure. for example if a family or group of people who live or work in the same building complain of headaches or flu-like symptoms these symptoms may be caused by high levels of carbon monoxide. also family pets living in the home may become sick which can be another clue to diagnosing carbon monoxide poisoning. in the winter unexplained headaches nausea or dizziness may be caused by heating systems that are not working correctly and are causing a buildup of carbon monoxide. delayed symptoms or long-term adverse effects of carbon monoxide poisoning can occur days or weeks after poisoning. the delayed symptoms or effects may include memory loss changes in personality disorientation impaired reasoning ability and behavioral or learning difficulties. 3 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning?
your doctor may only test you for bacterial vaginosis if you: have symptoms. are going to have a hysterectomy or surgical abortion ( bacterial vaginosis increases infection risk afterwards). are pregnant and have had a preterm delivery in the past (a past preterm delivery may have been caused by infection). your doctor can diagnose bacterial vaginosis based on your history of symptoms a vaginal examination and a sample of the vaginal discharge. laboratory tests to detect signs of bacterial vaginosis may include: wet mount. a sample of vaginal discharge is mixed with a salt (normal saline) solution after placing it on a microscope slide. the prepared slide is examined to identify the bacteria present to look for white blood cells that indicate an infection and to look for unusual cells called clue cells. the presence of clue cells is the most reliable indicator of bacterial vaginosis. whiff test. several drops of a potassium hydroxide (koh) solution are added to a sample of vaginal discharge to determine whether a strong fishy odor is produced. a fishy odor on the whiff test suggests bacterial vaginosis. vaginal ph. the normal vaginal ph is 3. 8 to 4. 5. bacterial vaginosis usually causes the vaginal ph to rise above 4. 5. gram stain. a sample of the vaginal discharge is placed on a microscope slide. a special dye is applied to the slide causing certain types of bacteria (gram-positive bacteria) to turn a shade of purple while coloring others (gram-negative bacteria) pink. in bacterial vaginosis gram-negative bacteria especially gardnerella vaginalis are most common. oligonucleotide probes. this test detects the genetic material ( dna ) of bacterial vaginosis bacteria. oligonucleotide probe testing is very accurate but is not routinely available in most labs. the presence of clue cells an increased vaginal ph and a positive whiff test are enough evidence to treat for bacterial vaginosis. bacterial vaginosis may be detected during routine pap testing. but pap testing is not a standard test to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for bacterial vaginosis?

i have no way of determining if your arm is broke over the internet since i don't know the details of the injury (location severity) or have the ability to examine you. only an x-ray can give you that answer. other causes to consider that may account for your symptoms would be nerve compression from the contusion sustained during the incident. again you will need to see your medical provider to have a definitive answer -- not something that can be done in this forum.	forearm and wrist hurts and occasionally numb finger. could my arm be broke? . my nephew pushed on my arm with his feet really hard and sent instant pain up my arm and now about a week later my arm hurts pretty bad! arm hurts from wrist to elbow and hurts to open hand fully.

i'm sorry to hear you're in pain. the good news is once the gallbladder's been removed it can never cause you a problem again. the gallbladder cannot grow back. the pain you are experiencing might feel a lot like the old gallbladder pain but it's definitely something else. the thing is the body isn't all that great about pinpointing the source of pain. this means your pain could be coming from anywhere in the same region as your gallbladder used to be. i suggest you see a doctor for further evaluation. he or she might want to check your liver your pancreas or even your intestines. any of these structures (and many others) could cause pain similar to that of gallstones. the only way you'll know for sure is with a physical examination. wishing you well!	i had my gallbladder removed 2 years ago. ive been having the same pains i had before it was removed. can it grow back? . if it isnt possible for it to grow back. what are the pains ive been having?

"a bright yellow nasal discharge does not automatically mean ""sinusitis"" or even indicate a bacterial infection. mucous can become yellow for a variety of reasons including simple stagnation. most sinus infections like colds are viral and do not require antibiotics. the fact that you do not have a fever or other sinus related symptoms would seem to indicate that you may not have a sinusitis. you can definitely wait it out a bit longer. viral infections tend to last about a week; worse in the first 3-4 days. do all of the supportive measures: drink plenty of water humidify your environment use saline nasal spray (as well as the pantanse) and keep that stuffy nose following. should your symptoms persist or worsen it would be wise to seek medical care so that you can be properly examined and treated."	have had a very bad cold for last week now i have yellow discharge from my nose no fever or anything sinus infection? . also suffer from major allergies and am on pantanse (sp) for that. yellow discharge started just a day ago. am i better off letting it ride if its viral or see about antibiotics? i have no other major symptoms fever aches etc just a nasty bright yellow discharge from my nose.

you are right that losing excess weight usually helps heartburn symptoms as this article describes. something else that might be going on is changes in your diet. certain foods can make heartburn worse (see this article for top 10 heartburn foods ). how does your diet change when losing weight? also do you lose fast or slowly. that may have an impact as well. i suggest going to a registered dietitian as you lose weight to track the type of food you are eating. also a physical prior to losing weight (sharing your concerns with your healthcare provider) can help as well. good luck!	extremely intense heartburn everytime i drop weight. any ideas? . two times i dropped 40lbs and two times i had ongoing extremely intense heartburn (based on a doctor's medical opinion) beneath my lower sternum. everytime i put the weight back on heartburn is gone. the pain was 3 times more intense than the kidney stone pain i endured. i cannot live that way but i want to lose weight. there's an article on webmd that explains losing weight helps against heartburn but that's not at all true for me. any ideas?

pelvic floor muscle exercises can help both men and women with stress or urge urinary incontinence urinary urgency and frequency. . so let’s start by learning to find the muscle. everyone at one time or another has been in a crowded room and felt as if he or she were going to pass gas or “wind. ” most will try to squeeze the muscles of the anus to prevent the passing of gas. if you do this – you are squeezing the back part of the pelvic floor muscles the part that supports your rectal sphincter. another example is to imagine you have an egg in your rectum and you are trying to break it. in both cases the muscles being squeezed are the pelvic floor muscle. so if you feel a “pulling” sensation at the anus you are squeezing the correct muscles. figure out how to fit the exercises also called kegel exercises into your daily routine and you are there. it may take 4-6 weeks of doing the exercises before you notice a change so be patient. a regular kegel exercise routine may also help improve sexual response in men and women and may prevent other problems like stool incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse (dropped bladder or uterus) from occurring at all.	what is the correct way to do pelvic exercises?
no one knows what causes schizophrenia for certain but researchers believe it is a combination of genetics which increase the risk and environmental influences which trigger the genetic predisposition. there is also evidence that changes in body chemistry during puberty may also play a role. more recently researchers have linked schizophrenia to brain developmental problems that occur in a fetus when a woman contracts certain viruses during pregnancy -- most notably influenza toxoplasmosis and rubella. research also implicates genital or reproductive infections present in the mother's body at the time of conception with increasing the baby's future risk of developing schizophrenia.	what causes schizophrenia?

lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus or sle) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues as though they were foreign substances. lupus is not contagious. no one knows exactly what causes the body to attack its own tissues. a person may be born with a certain genetic makeup that affects how the immune system functions or makes him or her at risk for lupus. a combination of factors can trigger the autoimmune process some of which may affect one person but not another. 1 exposure to ultraviolet light usually from sunlight is known to trigger the disease process and symptom flares. hormonal factors are linked to autoimmune disease though the link is poorly understood. some research shows an increased risk of lupus with higher levels of estrogen. but a separate study did not find evidence that the hormones estrogen or prolactin taken for hormone replacement therapy or birth control or taken previously for fertility treatments increased the risk of lupus. 2 another study showed that women with stable lupus had no increased risk of symptom flares from taking birth control pills. 3 smoking may increase the risk of getting lupus and may make the disease more severe. some medications are suspected triggers of lupus and symptom flares. some infections are suspected triggers. some people who have cytomegalovirus (cmv) parvovirus (such as fifth disease ) and hepatitis c infections eventually develop lupus. the epstein-barr virus has been linked to lupus in children. chemical exposure has been known to trigger lupus. suspected chemical toxins include trichloroethylene in well water and silica dust. hair dyes and straighteners linked to lupus in the past are no longer considered to be lupus triggers. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes lupus systemic lupus erythematosus?

i've had this same feeling of hot skin and feeling flush for over 10 years now but i do not have a fever. i've tried several different vitamins and herbs but what i've come to realize is that the reason i'm feeling this way is because i'm not hydrated enough. i know you think that this couldn't be what is causing this for you but i would encourage you to drink two or three bottles of cold water when this hot feeling starts to come on and then see how this makes you feel 15 to 20 min later. i know this seems too simple to be the solution but it's worth a try. it has certainly been the solution for me. i'm a 45 male. i do have low testosterone and get weekly injections for this. i spend 95% of my time inside a cool 70 degree house so i shouldn't be dehydrated but this has been my solution. maybe i'm not dehydrated but for whatever reason this works for me. best of luck in finding how to solve this issue in your body. i know how frustrating it can be to feel this way and not know what to do or even try. best of health to you! scott	i have no fever but my skin feels hot. what does that mean? . this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot. my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards. it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back.

i think sometimes parents jump to the conclusion that a baby’s gas or fussiness is caused by their baby formula. instead it just may be that baby is at a stage when she’s colicky. so instead of changing baby’s formula all around you’d really do better to talk to your pediatrician. that’s because intolerance to the baby formula is much less likely than colic for which we have no known cause -- or cure. so instead of parents agonizing about the formula they probably just need to wait until baby outgrows the colic which is usually at about three months. another common bottle-feeding problem is the way parents position babies: some lie them completely flat which can make babies choke when feeding on the bottle. so be sure to have your baby semi-inclined or upright. another common mistake is propping the bottle. don’t prop baby’s bottle; it can be a choking hazard. that is also why you should also always be present when baby is feeding even when she’s old enough to hold her own bottle. . the main thing: do lots of trial-and-error to be sure you find a bottle and nipple combination that works for your child. so don’t stock up on too many of the same kind of bottles unless you know your child is going to take it well. actually the same goes for formula diapers and all baby things: [don’t stock up] unless you know your baby is adjusted to that type or brand. also when you’re bottle feeding make sure milk is filling up the nipple of baby’s bottle. otherwise she could swallow a lot of air.	what are some common bottle-feeding problems and mistakes?

there's no need to try and make up for years of inactivity overnight. in fact you could get injured or burn out by doing that. instead start slowly and build up gradually. if that means starting with just five minutes of walking then that's what you ought to do. one helpful plan for getting started is the five-minutes-out five-minutes-back plan. just like it sounds you walk out for five minutes turn around and walk back. that's it. 10 minutes of walking and off you go about your day. if you feel ambitious you can do seven and a half or even 10 minutes out and back and add some stretching when you finish if you like. one of the best ways to get motivated and stay that way is to set goals. try setting a weekly exercise plan starting today for the week coming up. write down what day(s) of the week what time of day minutes of activity and the activity that you'll do. be as specific and realistic as possible and remember that it's not how much you do when you get started but that you simply get started. keep setting and reviewing your goals weekly for at least three months. that way you'll be sure to stay on track and build exercise into your life as a habit.	how can older adults get started exercising?

lichen planus is a chronic and self-limiting disease. it has been seen that skin lesions subside within 9-12 months in about 50 percent of the cases. since you are still developing fresh lesions you will have to take a course of tablet prednisolone 20 mg daily for 6 weeks which can be reduced gradually. you seem to have severe itching which is not responding much to levocetirizine. i would recommend you take tablet hydroxyzine 25 mg twice daily till the itchy subsides. along with this apply clobetasol propionate on the itchy areas. but if large surface area is involved dilute it in a moisturizing lotion in the ratio of 1:4. this will surely help you. the probable causes:1. immune dysfunction. 2. genetic causes. 3. dental amalgam. 4. stress. 5. anxiety. 6. depression. differential diagnosis:lichenoid drug eruption. probable diagnosis:lichen planus. preventive measures:reduce stress and anxiety. regarding follow up:revert back after four weeks for follow up to a dermatologist online. ---> <link>	Hi doctor,I am suffering from acute eruptive lichen planus.

fractures of any of the bones of the knee are traumatic injuries typically caused by moderate to high forces (such as car accidents contact sports or falls). fractures may be accompanied by swelling or bruising but are almost always extremely painful and tender. the pain is typically so severe that people are often unable to walk or even put their full weight on the knee. fractures are an emergency and should be checked by a doctor. this evaluation will generally include x-rays and other relevant studies. a delay in evaluation can result in fracture fragments being moved and associated injuries. depending on the particular fracture the doctor may either recommend immobilization (with a cast or splint) or surgery to repair it. fractures often heal with no long-term problems. some fractures however are complicated by arthritis or by injuries to arteries or nerves that can be serious.	what is a fracture or broken bone of the knee and how is it treated?

i'm assuming the splotches go away eventually after your shower? if so it sounds like you're describing a normal situation. whenever a person takes a warm or hot shower the skin's blood vessels dilate from the heat. this causes two noticeable effects. first dilated vessels within the skin become much more visible. second when blood vessels dilate there's less pressure inside them. less pressure means it's harder for the heart to pump that blood all the way up from the feet to the chest. so when you see those blotchy patches on the lower extremities after a shower you're usually just seeing areas of dilated blood vessels. this is not a dangerous situation like a blood clot or anything. it's a normal phenomenon that occurs to a lot of people when they take a hot shower. it is especially noticeable in fair-skinned people because the blood vessels are much easier to see. wishing you well!	after showering i have red/blotchy patches on my legs what are these? . so i have the shower on about 39 degrees celsius and was in there around 5-10mins due to a hairwash. after i had finished i noticed around my knees/shins were purple with red blotches going from my knee don the side of my leg and onto my food more so on my right than left leg. they were not tender nor raised just seemed like a discolouration. this has happened before just wondered what it was?
you should use a minimum spf a 15 but even more importantly than that you can even go higher to a 30 or up to a 50. i think beyond that it doesn't make much difference. but the most important thing is to reapply it every few hours because whether or not you are out there swimming sweating or rubbing it off it wears off over time and it gets degraded by the sun exposure itself. so you have to apply enough product but also reapply it often enough in order to maintain that protection. don't forget to put it on your neck and your chest because those are areas that are exposed. if you are wearing a scoop neck or a v-neck and you are just walking around it's incidental sun exposure. the sun exposure is cumulative. your skin remembers that first exposure as a child and that's been building up building up building up in your skin and eventually it crosses a threshold when you hit your; it could be in your 20s 30s 40s or beyond depending on your skin type and how much exposure you have had where all of a sudden it starts to show. both as signs of aging and even worse signs of skin cancer.	what level of spf should one use on a daily basis?

as with many blood tests (such as hormone levels) there can be considerable variation in results from lab to lab time of day or season since vitamin d levels tend to be best at the end of summer. perhaps the best indicator of general vitamin d levels is [the] 25(oh)d blood test for it measures vitamin d from both sun and dietary sources. this form of vitamin d also lasts in the body for around 30 days. . so who should push for blood testing? bearing in mind that the 25(oh)d blood test can cost upwards of $200 many primary care providers have chosen to just recommend an increased intake of vitamin d. the dose is based upon the person's specific health history. until there are studies set specifically to establish optimal dosage and blood levels the primary care model makes sense. among healthy adult women without excessive sun contact consuming 800 iu per day of vitamin d is a reasonable choice. for your specific vitamin d recommendation check with your gynecologist or primary care provider.	should i get my blood level of vitamin d checked?

hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system the body’s natural defense system. without a strong immune system the body has trouble fighting off disease. both the virus and the infection it causes are called hiv. white blood cells are an important part of the immune system. hiv invades and destroys certain white blood cells called cd4+ cells. if too many cd4+ cells are destroyed the body can no longer defend itself against infection. the last stage of hiv infection is aids (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). people with aids have a low number of cd4+ cells and get infections or cancers that rarely occur in healthy people. these can be deadly. but having hiv does not mean you have aids. even without treatment it takes a long time for hiv to progress to aids-usually 10 to 12 years. if hiv is diagnosed before it becomes aids medicines can slow or stop the damage to the immune system. with treatment many people with hiv are able to live long and active lives. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what is hiv? what is aids?

the allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. it continues from november till february based on the climate in your place. you have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). if it is nose or lung the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. in this situation you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed. on the other hand you can apply a drop of anu thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed. during evenings and nights when it is too cold you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug) nose (by applying oil drops) head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). the external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. so prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy. if you have allergic asthma then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. breathing exercises will help you. if you have allergic skin disorder then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. this helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. the skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication. revert back to an ayurveda specialist online for further follow up --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am a 45 year old female.

lactose intolerance in older children and adults can be detected by using the lactose tolerance test or the lactose hydrogen breath test. the lactose tolerance and lactose hydrogen breath tests are not given to infants and very young children who are suspected of having lactose intolerance because they require cooperation for multiple samplings of blood or breath which can be difficult if the infant or child is not cooperative. the dose of lactose that is needed for the lactose tolerance and hydrogen breath tests also may present problems for infants and very young children since if they are intolerant of lactose they may develop diarrhea and become dehydrated. special masks have been developed for infants and very young children that can make the sampling of breath for the lactose hydrogen breath test easier to perform.	how does testing for lactose intolerance differ in adults?

it is not possible to offer you a number -- your statistical chances of becoming pregnant. there are just too many unknown factors to consider. i can say that the depo provera is an excellent contraceptive but not 100%. when you have unprotected intercourse you are really taking a chance with just about any contraceptive method short of sterilization (tubal ligation). could you be pregnant? yes that would be possible. you would need to see your medical provider and have a very accurate pregnancy test ordered or take a few home pregnancy tests. there can be many reasons for a woman to have sharp lower abdominal pain other than a pregnancy so you would benefit from having a hands-on examination. this is really the only way to get a sure answer.	chances of being pregnant after having unprotected sex within the 10th-12th week of being on the depo shot? . i first started getting the depo shot august of last year. i received a shot on september 5th. within the 10th and 12th week on that shot i had unprotected sex multiple times. then i received the shot on november 28th. recently i have been very tired all of the time. i've been sleeping half of my day awake. yesterday i woke up with a sharp pain in my lower abdomen that went away after a few minutes but felt severe. i know there have been many women pregnant on the depo before.

the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) assigns a category system to classify the possible risks to a fetus when a specific medicine is taken during pregnancy. xanax and its generic (alprazolam) have been assigned pregnancy category d meaning this class of medication have shown clear evidence of risk to the fetus in studies. pregnancy category d is a stronger warning class than pregnancy categories c or b classifications. a pregnancy category d medicine may still be given to a pregnant woman if the health care provider believes that the benefits to the woman outweigh the possible risks to the unborn child. i would not just stop taking the medication if you are concerned that you may be causing harm to your baby. work with your health care provider to decide whether you should be taking the medication. if you reach a decision to not take the medication any longer work with your provider or pharmacist to taper (decrease gradually) the dose to take and to prevent withdrawal symptoms. common withdrawal symptoms consist of but are not limited to nausea vomiting diarrhea increased heart rate palpitations hallucinations memory loss confusion panic attacks seizures dizziness headaches depression and insomnia. it is important to work with your health care provider to make sure you are getting the best care possible.	i am five and a half months pregnant and take xanax. can this drug harm the fetus and how do i taper off my dosage?

mmm probably not. if this gets bothersome in terms of pain or bleeding or blocking sinus drainage then i'd definitely recommend you get it checked out by a physician. if it persists for more than a few weeks you may also want to get it checked out. it's rare to get cancer in that area though not unheard of but i'd consider that a longshot. more likely it's a cyst or something similar to a zit. as always if you find this lump worrisome make an appointment with your primary healthcare provider and have it looked at. take care!	i have a hard lump in my left nostril on the wall between nostrils. should i be concerned? . it's not painful

"well let's establish a few medical facts before we delve into the issue of whether or not valacyclovir caused the symptoms you described. first of all the flu--or influenza --can only be caused by coming in contact with the influenza virus. thus taking valacylovir and going for a run cannot ""cause"" you to get the flu. second 'nausea' is not a symptom of influenza. the flu is a respiratory virus. it affects your nasal passages and lungs. it's true if you swallow a lot of post-nasal drip caused by the influenza virus you might get nauseated. but generally speaking the flu is a respiratory virus. it's true that nausea and headache are potential side effects of valacyclovir. however i'm not aware of fever and chills being known side effects of this drug. to be fair the most common side effects of all medications are nausea and diarrhea so i tend to consider those as 'expected' side effects. if your flu-like symptoms persist you definitely should return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. enlarged lymph nodes should not be taken lightly. if your fever exceeds 101. 3f seek emergency medical attention. meanwhile drink a lot of fluids. it's entirely possible you coincidentally picked up a virus just as you began your course of valacyclovir. the onset of your symptoms may have nothing to do with the medication but the symptoms are worthy of being evaluated further if they don't go away within a couple of days. wishing you well!"	i want to know if the flu-like symptoms i'm experiencing are from the valacyclovir i was prescribed. i was prescribed valacyclovir for treatment of hsv1. i had been taking 500mg twice daily for 4 days. on day 4 i went on a 2 mile run. i noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were somewhat swollen and tender. after sleeping for 6 hours i woke with flu symptoms. tight neck headache congestion nausea fever chills etc. i read online that these symptoms are also common side effects of the valacyclovir. is it likely that the medication in combination with the run just brought on an actual flu?

an ear infection is usually treatable and permanent damage to the ear or to the hearing is much less common today with proper treatment. treatment may include medications for pain and fever antibiotics for bacterial ear infections and/or observation of symptoms. pain relief for an earache. acetaminophen or ibuprofencan help relieve an earache with a cold or a fever over 102 degrees f. these medications usually control the ear pain within one to two hours. (earaches tend to hurt more at bedtime. ) antibiotics for an ear infection. prescribed antibiotics will kill the bacteria causing the ear infection. they are not needed to treat an earache due to a cold or a virus. antibiotics may cause nausea diarrhea rashes or yeast infections and may interact with other drugs. myringotomy (ear tubes) to relieve ear fluid. if fluid remains in the ear for more than three months or if your child has repeated ear infections your doctor may insert small metal or plastic tubes through the eardrum to help keep the ear free of fluid and infection. this outpatient procedure is usually performed on children and is done under general anesthesia. the tubes usually remain in from eight to 18 months and normally fall out on their own. in some instances the doctor may choose to leave the tubes in longer.	how are earaches from a cold or ear infection treated?

well when a couple is going in and it turns out that the numbers are pretty good but she’s still not getting pregnant but she’s ovulating ok one of the techniques is called intrauterine insemination. iui what we do is we take the sperm specimen from the man what we do is we wash away all the accessory fluids and just retain the sperm and that’s instilled up on the top of the woman’s uterus on the day she’s ovulating. that way the sperm are there much closer to the egg and it improves the chances of conception. the problem is the wash is very operator dependent. if you get a technician who doesn’t know what he or she is doing or doesn’t care or uses the wrong technique then you could start off with a great numbers and great quality highly motile happy sperm and end up with abysmal numbers which means chances for success are low. so the problem is the art of the wash really has fallen by the wayside with advances in more complicated and modern techniques of in-vitro fertilization. how could the technician not care? because that’s the problem is a lot of technicians aren’t trained. we had one lady once who brought us numbers before and after the wash and the numbers afterwards were abysmal. so we called the doctor’s office and asked who did the wash and what technique was used? so a nurse came on the line and she said yeah i rented a video from a medical source and i watched the video on how to do the wash it was her first and she watched it on a monday and then they did the specimen. so it’s really a very technical procedure and if you don’t know any better if you’ve not been trained to realize that there are different washes you can do and what an ideal number should be then you’re not going to know any better.	why is sperm washed in infertility treatments and what are the downsides?
"the gravest risk for less breast screening tests would be development of an advanced stage breast cancer. breast cancer is the most common gynecological cancer. its incidence is 135 in 100 000 women. its mortality rate is 27 per 100 000 women. compare this to cervical cancer where the incidence is 9. 3 per 100 000 women with a mortality of 2. 9. it's no wonder that women feel vulnerable about breast cancers. in a brand new meta-analysis the assertion that screening mammograms saves lives has been reaffirmed. currently 1 904 women in their 40s would have to be screened to extend the life of one woman. among women in their 50s 1 339 women would need to be screened to extend the life of one woman. the statistical risk reduction for the two age groups is 15% and 14%. the reason the ""50 somethings"" have been given the green light for routine mammograms is that they are at greater risk because of advancing age. it is this point which is the most heavily debated. is it not worth it to save the life of one woman by having to screen 565 more women? most women have a personal connection to one or more women who have had cancer diagnosed at an early age by a mammogram."	what risks do the new mammogram screening guidelines pose for patients?

hi mm here are 3 links that could help you and your wife to get pregnant but do watch the vid in the first one helpful would be the word and the others do have useful info. <link> <link> <link> just copy links into googel one at a time to the www. to open and read. one tip one link says about having sex or masturbating every 24 to 48 hours that you should question doing both to much will just release immature sperm and this wont make your wife pregnant. but do go find a lab and have a sperm test done if nothing else just to make sure its good. and do go get a blood test done get your testosterone checked out as this help your sperm count. but do keep healthy keep off fast and junk foods and sodas get and exercise do some walking or light jogging or combine both and swimming is really good for you keep off alcohol and forget smoking no social drugs and do watch what meds you taken. but timing is how your wife gets pregnant its all down to knowing her cycle like day 1 is first day of her period and day 14 is ovulation day give or take a day so your sperm needs to be there waiting for her egg to drop so unprotected sex about 3 to 4 days before? it takes our sperm 3 days to get in place and can live for 7 days. ok so far then now if around day 21 she gets spotting then there’s a good chance she’s pregnant wait for a week after she miss’s her period then go get tested at your doctor. last how comes you can come on here and tell the world of your problems but not your own doctor? do hope this helps you and your wife. good luck	how long is it safe to ice testicles without causing damage? . my wife is having a hard time getting pregnant so i did some research for home remedies and solutions because i am a little embarrassed to talk to my doctor about the possibility of me having fertility issues. i came across icing testicles as a common result. i want to give this a try before i go to my doctor. how long is it safe to ice my testicles in one period of time before i possibly cause damage if i will cause damage?
unfortunately mrsa can exist on those medical tools. it is really up to the clinic to keep them sanitized and up to the consumer/patient to make sure (a) hands are carefully washed (or gloves used) for examinations (b) stethoscopes and other medical are sanitized between patients (unfortunately a quick wipe with an alcohol swab really does do it). we do live in a germ-laden world and all human carry potential pathogens no matter how clean they appear to be or how well they wash. transmitting germs from one person to another is possible even with the most stringent hygiene procedures. mrsa is transmitted in day-care centers between children transmitted to parents and so on and so on. hospital-acquired mrsa can be deadly.	can mrsa and other staph germs linger on blood pressure cuffs scan thermometers and stethoscopes? . i recently read that mrsa and other very serious staph germs have been detected on every day check-in equipment/instruments at clinics and hospitals. what can we all do to protect ourselves?

avoid foods with high fat and salt content and avoid the wine just for now. foods high in potassium can counteract sodium since both work together in the body. foods such as banana's potatoes dark leafy greens and some yoghurts contain potassium. increase your fibre and magnesium intake which are again found in the food mentioned above as well as various other food like spinach tuna tomatoes kale apples oranges etc. again remember everything needs to be in moderation. eating 15 oranges or bananas is just going to cause other problems. i myself (and i am not an expert) would do light exercise such as walking as exercise is great in reducing blood pressure. however your body is a great judge on what is and is not best for you. if you feel too ill to go walking then don't! i cannot comment about the potential link with anesthesia used but i would not be too concerned at this current time. your body has just undergo a lot of stress and changes to accommodate for the surgery. your heart may have been pumping harder to keep your body functioning normally during this period of stress. it may take time for your body to adapt to the calm after the storm. i hope this may help reassure you <positive_smiley>	what should i eat and drink if i've had an incident of high blood pressure for the first time? . yesterday i had 8 moles removed. after the surgery i got a big headache. i was placed under observation for about an hour and given paracetamol until my blood pressure dropped. first time anything like this has ever happened to me. i still have a bit of a residual headache. could this have been caused by the anesthesia used? . can i eat normally have a glass of wine etc? should i take it easy for a day or two or can i go for walks and such?

"i also have been on sooo many anti-depressants and other meds for bipolar ii and always gained weight. i am a 40 year old woman who is 5'1 tall and at that time almost 150 pounds. but i was just prescribed a very new anti-depressant called fetzima there isn't any generic version as of yet. i am on the max dose at 80mg daily. but add lamictal adderall xanax seroquel ambien xr propranolol imitrex injections cambia liquid spinx nasal spray and lastly phenergen 25mg prn migraine with vomiting. but my point which i apologize for going off in so many directions thanks to the adderall 60mg daily. the fetzima is supposedly much better as far as weight is concerned. it actually lists that weight loss is more common than weight gain. and while i would never suggest anyone to be on a stimulant/adderall when i have never been add/adhd. i take it daily and in a pretty decent dosage to somehow get me to function thru the day. it's hard to figure out as the patient why a doctor would put you on a lot of ""uppers"" and then you need ""downers"". it is crazy. but with the adderall i have been on for almost 3 months and in all honestly i now weigh 103 pounds. so over 45 plus pounds in that 3 months. i can't describe the feeling of having absolute no appetite i actually don't eat anything until my 11 year old daughter is home from school then while i am making her a snack and later dinner for the family i try my best to eat a few bites here and there cause i do not want my daughter to think i am trying on purpose to not eat cause i want to be skinny. and so i lose all my weight in my breasts my butt arms and legs and my face is caving in. i will always have a larger stomach after childbirth but if things continue like this i'll end up in the hospital. so please think seriously what is most important as far as getting out of the depression that is so dark been there but if you do end up with weight gain side effect please either eat very healthy and exercise safely and hopefully the depression meds will help enough you will find more days to not just take care of your mental illness but start living healthy and happier. i wish you all the best and know that depression can be just as or more fatal than being a little overweight or very underweight. best wishes malissa"	do diet pills interact with depression and bipolar meds such as wellbutrin and geodon?

hi. long bones like tibia and fibula takes about 3-6 months to heals appropriately and can be assessed with the help of x rays. as far as fibula is concerned it unites on its own in almost all cases without active fixation and only tibia is fixed being the main weight bearing bone. so do not worry as gradually the healing will progress. you can review with regular follow up x rays with an orthopedician to get checked for progress of healing. hope this information helps.

leaving jelly overnight one time is unlikely to cause food poisoning it only will decrease the shelf life of the product. the shelf life is longer for jelly bought at the store versus homemade. store bought jelly is more standardized (with the right amount of sugar/fruit/liquid) and the sugar acts as a preservative. check the jelly for signs of spoilage like mold odor and changes in color. i suggest calling the company and asking them if the item should be discarded. and if you see symptoms in your child like vomiting diarrhea or decreased appetite call your doctor.	can you get food poisoning from jelly? . my two year old ate half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that was not refrigerated and in a baggie on the counter since yesterday. is he in danger of getting food poisoning. the jar says to refrigerate after opening. i don't eat jam or jelly and didn't think anything of it but my husband said he's gotten food poisoning from jelly before. should we take him to the hospital now or wait for any symptoms to arise? besides vomiting what would likely symptoms be?

i happen to think some of the most compassionate and helpful doctors are those who have experienced medical or disability challenges themselves and have successfully dealt with them. even though one doesn't get rid of fm it can be dealt with successfully. i hope your dream of becoming a pcp motivates you even more to learn about your fm and find success in dealing with it. then you can use your success with managing fm to motivate yourself through medical school and residency because there are a lot of future patients out there who need your help! medical school isn't easy but it's fun and rewarding. getting fm under control is probably the hardest part. then the rest of it should be a breeze! i know a number of doctors me included who have been able to practice successfully despite having fm. i would be thrilled to have you join our club in about 8 years!	i am ready academically to begin medical school but learned i have fibromyalgia. will i be able to become a doctor?

unfortunately no. sagging skin at the jawline (aka: jowls) is actually caused by two things: loss of fat volume in the face and loss of elasticity in the skin. we can try all kinds of things to reduce aging but gravity always wins in the end. while you can't exercise away your jowls there are cosmetic treatments for this condition. first is of course a facelift. in a facelift (technically called a rhytidectomy) incisions are made around the ear and at the hairline. the facial skin is gently loosened from the tissue layers below and pulled upward and outward. excess skin is removed leaving you with a firmer younger looking face. facelifts may sound painful but patients told me they didn't hurt much at all. recovery from a facelift takes a few weeks. the effect of a good facelift will last a decade or more. another treatment for sagging skin is dermal fillers. with this procedure a physician or specially trained nurse injects material into your cheek area to restore the volume you've naturally lost over time. this filler material usually works by stimulating collagen production. dermal fillers generally last for two years or so after which you need to get more injections. unless you get some type of medical intervention for your sagging skin at the jawline it will only get worse over time. if it bothers you try booking a consultation with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to learn about your options. wishing you well!	are there any excercises that can firm a jawline.

"i personally have never liked the taste or texture of oatmeal. this is unexpected because i like the taste of almost all foods i have ever tried. oatmeal tastes ok to me only if it is loaded with brown sugar and cinnamon etc. i love the taste of cold cereal and i would eat if every day for breakfast if i could justify it. but i can't because of the carbohydrate load. the very high-fiber cereals seem more reasonable to me but i'd rather eat other things personally. professionally i generally try to steer my patients away from oatmeal and high-fiber cereals during the period of time that they are trying to lose weight and reduce their a1c. i do steer them toward other breakfast options such as low-fat cottage cheese fruit greek yogurt light yogurt lean breakfast meats (canadian bacon turkey ham etc. ) soy sausages eggs (especially egg whites) and homemade protein shakes (100 calories of protein powder plus 100 calories from milk almond milk or fruit). we bring back the oatmeal and high-fiber cereals once they are in maintenance mode. i believe i am in the minority when it comes to my views on oatmeal and high-fiber cereal however my concern is the high carbohydrate load. i am suspicious of whole grains and believe they interfere with weight loss and a1c reduction unless the dietary fat intake is very low in which case i encourge eating these foods. the instant oatmeal is pretty highly processed in order to get it to cook so quickly. i believe the research supporting oatmeal consumption is suspect. there are clearly much worse foods one could eat but there are better ones too. i am a type 2 diabetic myself and love oats. however the doctor is right about highly processed cereals. their are far better grains to eat. if you like oatmeal try cooking steel cut oats. they are almost totally unprocessed and the gi is lower another thing you do not have to load your oatmeal with sugars or sweeteners to enhance the taste! simply add stevia and if you like brown sugar add 1/2 tsp unsulphered molasses with the stevia. the most important thing to keep oats from spiking your blood sugars is to eat a good fat or protein with it such as almond butter or even whey powder. this stops the spike cold. also do not eat a fruit at the same time as the startchy carbs. this accelorates the spike. instead eat a fruit as soon as you get up and the carbs (oats) at least 1/2 to1 hr later. if you don't have this time skip the fruit till snack time between breakfast and lunch! this works for me very well. eating this way raises my blood sugar around 20_35 points total on my post meal check! without the protein or fat and fruit at the same time the sugars would be 75_150 higher! i enjoy otameal periodically but because of the carb content it's not an everyday thing. i use 1/3 cup of oatmeal with 2/3 cup of skim milk or plain soy milk depending on what's available and my mood. avoid sweetened versions of soy milk at all cost. they're all loaded with sugar which defeats the whole purpose. i've learned that i can sweeten it with a couple packets of splenda in lieu of brown sugar add some pieces of pecans and a small amount of margarine (i personally like "" i can't believe it's not butter"" ) for taste. although oatmeal has some carbs it also is high in fiber which helps manage carbohydrate and cholesterol issues and it makes a nice breakfast while providing a little variety in the diet. i do not know it raised my blood glucose after consumption yes"	is oatmeal good for diabetes?

i'm sorry you're experiencing this. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose a skin ailment without a physical examination. i suggest you make an appointment to see your primary care provider. he or she can look at the bumps and tell you what they are and whether or not they need to be treated. weird bumps on the feet aren't unusual because the feet take a beating from walking and get exposed to all kinds of viruses and bacteria that may be lurking on floors in carpets and so on. fortunately most of these bumps aren't serious and don't cause much harm -- other than looking funky! your primary care provider can tell you what's going on and refer you to a foot doctor if necessary. good luck!	i have yellowish bumps on the instep of my feet
the goal of treatment of osteoporosis is the prevention of bone fractures by reducing bone loss or preferably by increasing bone density and strength. although early detection and timely treatment of osteoporosis can substantially decrease the risk of future fractures none of the available treatments for osteoporosis are complete cures. in other words it is difficult to completely rebuild bone that has been weakened by osteoporosis. therefore prevention of osteoporosis is as important as treatment. the following are osteoporosis treatment and prevention measures: lifestyle changes including quitting cigarette smoking curtailing excessive alcohol intake exercising regularly and consuming a balanced diet with adequate calcium and vitamin d medications that stop bone loss and increase bone strength such as alendronate (fosamax) risedronate (actonel) raloxifene (evista) ibandronate (boniva) calcitonin (calcimar) zoledronate (reclast) and denosumab (prolia) medications that increase bone formation such as teriparatide (forteo)	what is the treatment for osteoporosis and can osteoporosis be prevented?

when a tooth is properly extracted a graft is mostly not necessary. the healing time is: six to 8 weeks after extraction the implant can be placed. the implant (depending on the brand type bone etc. ) will integrate in 2-4 months. at that point a crown restoration can be fabricated in 1-2 weeks (from impression to finish). usually an uncomplicated implant placement will take about 4-6 months from extraction to delivery of the final crown. complications such as bone deficiencies are common enough but not the norm.	what is the timetable for a dental implant?

for most people including children and teens the challenge is to get enough physical activity. however excessive exercise and overtraining often coupled with restrictive eating can be a problem especially for some female athletes and dancers as well as girls who become obsessive about weight loss. overtraining like eating disorders can result in decreased estrogen and eventually lead to thin bones that break easily. years ago it was not unusual for coaches and trainers to encourage athletes to be as thin as possible for many sports including dancing gymnastics figure skating running and diving. fortunately many coaches now realize that being too thin is unhealthy and can negatively affect performance as well as lifelong health.	can i get too much exercise?
whether or not your hair loss is related depends on how rapidly you are losing weight. if you are crash dieting or using a fad diet for rapid weight loss you may indeed have a caloric deficiency which is translating to hair loss. i recommend that you lose the weight slowly and in a controlled fashion (1 pound per week) and be sure to maintain good nutrition while you're dieting.	i'm dieting to lose weight and my hair is falling out. could my diet be causing my hair loss?

"in general you should consult your doctor if you think you have a bacterial or viral infection. exceptions include the common cold which is usually self-limiting and not life-threatening. in some cases it's difficult to determine the origin of an infection because many ailments -- including pneumonia meningitis and diarrhea -- can be caused by either bacteria or viruses. but your doctor usually can pinpoint the cause by listening to your medical history and conducting a physical exam. if necessary he or she also can order a blood or urine test to confirm a diagnosis or a ""culture test"" of tissue to identify bacterial or viral growth. occasionally a biopsy of affected tissue may be required."	how are bacterial and viral infections diagnosed?

"most helpful answer well there is pretty much zero statistical probability that an abdominal x-ray could miss an 8-month fetus. could an abdominal x-ray miss an 8-week embryo? it's possible if the radiologist or other health care provider wasn't looking specifically for an embryo or fetus. but even at that any abnormality on an x-ray probably would be picked up. abdominal x-ray is not how pregnancies are confirmed. the ""gold standard"" for confirming a pregnancy is the pelvic ultrasound. as to what's going on well it's difficult to say. you may be experiencing a false pregnancy. but that's just a wild guess since i don't know anything about your health history. i'd suggest you sit down with your ob-gyn and ask for a detailed explanation of the results of your abdominal exam and x-ray. wishing you all the best!"	is there a statistical possibility an abdominal x-ray could miss a pregnancy/fetus? . the past 8 mos. i'm having the same pregnancy symptoms i had with my son. i started the year with late periods. then breast tenderness morning sickness food adversion cravings & weight gain in the spring. i experienced flutters in the summer. followed by movements bloating & excessive gas. lastly was a feeling of kicking the start of fall(maybe muscle spasms) & lower back pain. pregnancy tests were negative. i had an abdominal examine & x-ray to find out what's wrong. what's going on?
lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus or sle) is a condition of chronic inflammation caused by an autoimmune disease. autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. the precise reason for the abnormal autoimmunity that causes lupus is not known. inherited genes viruses ultraviolet light and drugs may all play some role. the genes some people inherit seem to increase the tendency of developing autoimmune diseases and autoimmune diseases such as lupus rheumatoid arthritis and immune thyroid disorders are more common among relatives of patients with lupus than the general population. some scientists believe that the immune system in lupus patients is more easily stimulated by external factors like viruses or ultraviolet light. sometimes symptoms of lupus can be precipitated or aggravated by only a brief period of sun exposure. research provides direct evidence that a key enzyme's failure to dispose of dying cells contributes to sle. accordingly a genetic mutation that disrupts the body's cellular waste disposal may be involved in the beginning of sle.	is lupus hereditary?

baby : your fully formed fetus now in about its 11th week of development measures 2. 6 to 3. 1 inches from crown to rump and weighs between half an ounce and seven-tenths of an ounce -- about the size of a peach. the head is still disproportionately bigger than the body but the rest of the body is starting to catch up. in fact your baby is growing rapidly these days. the face is starting to look more human with eyes moving closer together. toes and fingers are clearly separate and ankles and wrists have formed. external genitalia are becoming visible. intestines are shifting into their proper place too. mom-to-be : your uterus has grown a lot. it's filling your pelvis now and starting to grow upward into your abdomen. it probably feels like a soft smooth ball. if you haven't put on any weight yet because of morning sickness you'll begin to now as you start to feel better. tip for the week : it's easy for your partner to feel left out of the pregnancy since he isn't feeling the same physical changes that you are. both of you should share your excitement about having a child your dreams worries and your partner's level of involvement. suggest that your partner goes to a check-up with you to hear the baby's heartbeat.	what can i expect during week 13 of my pregnancy?
"well it depends. let's talk for a moment about blood clots. there are different types of blood clots. when you get a cut on your finger it bleeds and then eventually the blood gets very thick and the active bleeding stops. that thickened blood is a clot. it eventually will become a scab. this type of clot is a ""good"" clot because it stops you from bleeding too much. however just as there are ""good"" clots there also are ""bad"" clots. a deep vein thrombosis (dvt) is a type of blood clot that occurs deep in a vein usually in the leg. this type of clot usually is caused by poor circulation. a dvt can break loose and travel to the brain where it can cause a stroke. it also can travel to the lung where it can cause a pulmonary embolism. i hope this response and the links will give you all the information you need."	can a blood clot losen and move and get stuck somewhere else
the medical jury is still out as the the true existance of female ejaculation. some feel that it may be involuntary urination and other feel that it may originate from the skene's glands located in the vaginal area. either way it does not originate from the uterus or cervix so a hysterectomy would not likely change this phenomena. hi if you could do it before then i don't think things would have changed that much all you can do is try it. good luck	can a women squirt after a hysterectomy

"this question doesn't have a straightforward answer unfortunately. the active ingredient in marijuana is called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or ""thc"" for short. when a person smokes marijuana the thc is rapidly absorbed by the body which causes the person to feel ""high. "" this effect is short-lived lasting maybe three or four hours. however an inactive form of thc (called delta thc-acid) deposits itself in the fatty tissue. this is called the ""metabolite"" of thc. many marijuana tests don't look for active thc in the blood stream or urine. instead they look for this thc metabolite. despite a common belief that it takes longer for heavy pot users to ""test clean"" than someone who smoked marijuana just one time there isn't much scientific evidence to support that idea. every individual's body is unique. some people's bodies may clear the thc metabolite more rapidly than others. detecting thc depends on the type of test used also. some very sensitive tests can measure delta thc-acid levels up to 25 days after the person stopped using marijuana. while it would be nice to have a solid answer to the question of how long thc stays in your system after smoking marijuana it's just not possible to say with certainty."	how long does thc stay in your system?
once kids are in school their naïve trust in a safe world can begin to slip away. they’ll hear messages like “don’t talk to strangers” and they’ll inevitably see scenes of war and bloodshed on the news. it can be difficult for them to understand how some places are very far away and that some things aren’t going to happen in their schools and homes. don’t be overly explicit at this age. instead give them enough information to protect themselves but don’t fill in the details of every possibility. “if you see a gun don’t touch it. just tell the teacher right away ” or “if you see someone in the school that looks like they don’t belong there tell an adult about it. ” middle schoolers are at an awkward time with only one foot nearing adulthood. use your judgment about how much news to expose your child to but keep in mind that violent images (especially video) can leave a very strong impression. children at this age are vulnerable to peer pressure and to the formation of prejudices that may become a permanent part of their worldview so be careful about over-generalizations. as your children approach adulthood it’s time to help them understand the complex challenges the world faces. why do those people on television hate us? what is our country doing to protect us? what do we believe in? how do we know who is right and who is wrong? as children leave their parent’s homes there’s a new vulnerability: viewpoints and arguments from other sides of the fence. help your children stand up for what they believe in by discussing what “the other side” thinks-not just to say that we’re right but to understand the why and even the why of how other people might be misled.	how do you talk to school-age children about terrorism?

good-news-bad-news. the lhrh agonist (lupron is one brand) is critical to the success of prostate cancer treatment for many men and sounds like it was effective along with the brachytherapy in your husband's case. the bad news is the potential for side effects. in this case he needs a serum free and total testosterone level to determine if the level is still low for his age. giving back testosterone in the form of shots or rub on gels could raise his t level but might increase the chance of a cancer recurrence. discuss this with your doctor. a lot would depend on the psa level (should be very low) and the digital rectal exam (should have a very flat prostate with no nodules) to allow the possibility of t replacement. as far as the penis side effects he could get a prescription for a vacuum erection device (ved) to stretch and exercise his penis to try to restore the length and size. the ved can also be used with other treatments for erectile dysfunction (ed) such as viagra/cialis/levitra; muse; caverject etc. he could see a urologist who specializes in treatments for ed for more details.	my husband is prostate cancer-free but the side effects of lupron linger. is there any way to reverse this situation?

i think it is tough in that you want to balance your child's autonomy and also make sure they get the care they need. i would ask your child to sign a release of information where their counselor at college is free to contact you and disclose information. then have a discussion with therapist that you would like to be notified of future appointments (so you can push your kid to attend) and also of missed appointments. some campuses may have a support group -- the student counseling service at college might be able to direct [you to] -- they may even run the groups.	our child in college is being treated for depression. we feel more support is needed but live far away. what can we do?

the thing is when you go to a higher altitude the sun's rays are more intense and oftentimes you don't feel that hot burning and there is wind associated with it as well and then the sun reflecting off the snow. so there are so many reasons why you are more likely to burn on any exposed areas when you are out there skiing. so use a higher spf product and then every time you get down to the bottom and you are waiting to go up on that lift again reapply that sunscreen. you may have to reapply it as often as every hour. i recommend using a spf 30 or higher and then also adding a mineral powder sunscreen on top of that that you can brush on and add to your protection in that way.	i love to ski and snowboard but my face gets sunburned even with sunscreen. how high of an spf do i need to wear?
i want to. talk about the use of aspirin for prevention of heart attacks strokes and other blood clotting problems. aspirin is commonly used for minor aches and pains and to reduce fever. aspirin also combats the effects of platelets blood cells that help blood clot. this helps reduce the number of heart attacks and strokes. indeed platelets are essential to human life because an excessively low count would cause bleeding. but platelets can also be involved in too much clot formation. when this occurs it can block a blood vessel and can lead to many potentially life-threatening problems including heart attack stroke and pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). it’s important to achieve a balance between too much clotting and not enough clotting. there is much confusion regarding the use of aspirin in prevention of heart attack and stroke. the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke — called primary prevention — is widely debated. there have been approximately seven clinical trials testing the effects of aspirin in someone with no prior history of heart attack or stroke. the doses have varied from 50 mg to 500 mg. while not all the trials showed benefit only one trial showed an increased risk of bleeding but those were patients on high dose aspirin. based on this ambiguous data the current american college of cardiology/american heart association guidelines recommend aspirin for primary prevention only in men with diabetes and intermediate cardiovascular risk and without an increased risk of bleeding. those patients who have a 10% risk of a cardiovascular event over a 10-year period are defined as intermediate risk. the european society of cardiology guidelines do not recommend aspirin in primary prevention. in patients with previous stroke heart attack or certain other blood clotting problems aspirin has beneficial effects. for these people the american college of cardiology/american heart association guideline recommends starting aspirin 75 mg to 162 mg and continuing indefinitely in all patients unless other medical problems prevent its use. the benefits of aspirin need to outweigh the risk. yes it sure does. seven months ago my pulse went from around 55 to 65 count to over 200 beats. my blood pressure was steady at the 120 over 60. i was on a 325 coated aspirin since my by pass in 1999. i was on vacation at the time and when i seen my family doctor three weeks after it started he told me i had af and thanks god i was talking a 325 aspirin. my heart doctor agreed and now i am on pradax blood thinner. i have fluid in the lungs from the leaking blood and on a 40mg water pill. thank you toe fanjoy my hands and legs have been tingling and my right side has a pain can not move or cough it hurts	does aspirin help prevent heart attacks and strokes?

without the ability to examine you or do my own diagnostic tests there is really little that i can offer. herpes tends to be more painful than itchy although early stages can tingle/itch depending on the interpretation of the person who is experiencing symptoms. a uti tends to cause frequent urination with urgency; occasionally bloody urine or back pain. irritation of the urethra (the urinary opening) can also cause burning with urination. a white vaginal discharge can be many things including recurrent yeast. as much as i would like to help you i cannot blindly sort out the many many possibilities over the internet.	early stage of a herpes outbreak or is this a uti? . i got a yeast infection a couple of days into taking metronidzole for bv. after finishing monistat 3 two days ago my labia still itch and burn. i was seen by a gynecologist who confirmed i was clear of yeast and bv yesterday and she recommended i just be patient with the itching. i was seen by another doctor today as the itching got worse over night and i am having slight discomfort urinating. she took a urine sample and confirmed i didn't have a visible rash. i still have some white discharge.
you should not increase or decrease your medication dose on your own. instead you should contact your medical provider as soon as possible to find out what to do. eltroxin is a brand name for levothyroxine. when people have their thyroid gland removed they must take synthetic thyroid hormone for the rest of their lives. the thyroid plays a key role in body metabolism. even when a person takes synthetic thyroid hormone the blood level must be checked frequently -- usually at least once a year. when a person is having symptoms (such as the kind you describe) a blood test can be used to tell if the person has too much or too little of the hormone circulating in the system. the doctor will use this blood test information to adjust the medication dosage accordingly. keep in mind many other conditions (anxiety panic heart trouble -- just to name a few) can cause the symptoms you describe. you should not assume these symptoms are caused by your thyroid medication. if you suspect you are having a heart attack you should seek emergency medical attention. wishing you well!	am taking eltroxin 100mg/day now feelin my throat tight & heart palpitation should i increase or decrease 100mg? . after my thyroid gland was taken out year 2005 am taking eltroxin 100mg/ day.
"yes some women have significant cramping while taking provera to start a menstrual period. while we tell women their flow will begin around 72 hours after the last provera pill is taken bleeding can also begin before the pills are completed. usually it is suggested that all the pills be taken because the lining of the uterus may need all the synthetic progesterone to fully convert to a healthy status (""secretory effect""). in your specific case if you are having very severe cramping it is a reasonable option to check with the gyn prescribing the provera. they may suggest something for the discomfort. if your bleeding does start before the medication is done confirm that you should finish up all the provera pills. ."	is the pain and cramping i feel while taking provera normal and should i check with my doctor about it?

none of the major health organizations emphasize good or bad triglycerides -- the study you found was from 2002 and i have found nothing more recent to support it. the key is to think of heart disease risk like a puzzle with many different pieces. risk factors include high triglycerides high total cholesterol high ldl (bad cholesterol) and low hdl (good cholesterol) high blood pressure hyperglycemia and abdominal fat. someone with metabolic syndrome has a cluster of all these risk factors (instead of just one or two) putting them at even higher risk. for more on how to lower triglycerides see this article and for more on optimal blood lipid levels see this one. good luck!

the method of administering a cortisone injection to a joint is similar to that of soft-tissue injections. betadine however is more commonly used for sterilization of the skin over the joint. furthermore if there is an excessive amount of fluid within the joint it often is removed first with a separate syringe and needle prior to injection of the cortisone. removal of this joint fluid allows the doctor to examine the fluid and submit a sample to the laboratory for diagnosis. removal also rapidly relieves pain by reducing the pressure of the fluid within the joint. finally removal of fluid may allow the joint to heal more quickly.	how are cortisone injections of a joint given?

yes if you want. you may have the uti because of sex in the first place so if it doesn't hurt to pee anymore and you are feeling better you can have sex while you are still taking the antibiotics. if it hurts don't do it. many women will still have the urge to urinate more often until the infection is under control. remember to drink lots of fluids and be extra extra careful about your sexual hygiene. most utis are caused by bacteria from your colon that somehow gets transferred to your vaginal/urethral area. this can happen from contaminated fingers during foreplay to a wandering penis (even in a condom) that gets too near your anal opening. if you are having anal sex then a uti is just about guaranteed. as soon as you finish having sex try to urinate to flush out your urethral area and try and drink as much as you can the next day as well. keep those pipes flowing. i'd suggest waiting. sex causes friction and the last thing you need is to add friction to infected inflamed tissues. also drink a daily sugar free cranberry juice along with taking a daily cranberry supplement. just make sure that your supplement is at least 500 milligrams. it works. i used to get them all the time but since i have been taking the supplement i haven't had one in years. just to clarify on the user who suggested drinking cranberry juice and taking cranberry supplements. i was just at the doctor with an uti and i told him i was drinking lots of cranberry juice to get rid of the infection. he told me that cranberry juice will help in preventing an uti but will not help get rid of one and the best thing to drink is lots of water at least one an hour. and of course take the antibiotics prescribed. my suggestion is as soon as you feel like you have a uti get to the doctors and get antibiotics before the pain increases. and drink lots of water and use a heating pad. what is a uti? right! who would want to!	is it ok to have sex while i have a uti? . i was dignosed today with a uti is ok to still have sex? will it make it worse or more uncomfortable?

"perhaps the biggest issue that i encounter with flying is “airplane ears” — a term for barometric pressure-related ear pain usually on descent. i have had it myself a few times. my ear pain lasted several days no matter what i tried to do. when i couldn’t hear for a few days i even visited the audiology department of the university to see if i ruptured my eardrum. i didn’t. several annoying days later my painful ears returned to normal. when our eustachian tubes fail to regulate that middle ear pressure pain or at least pressure will develop. we try to swallow (they usually take your drink away before landing) chew gum (if we have it) or hold our nose and blow called a valsalva maneuver) but this doesn’t always work. if you have a long-standing history of airplane ears you might take a decongestant before flying but this too doesn’t always work. at the american academy of pediatrics national conference several years ago i was introduced to the earpopper an electronic device to correct this barometric pressure issue. you simply put the battery-powered blower in one side of your nose plug the other nostril and push the button as you swallow. this earpopper sends air up the eustachian tubes and equalizes the painful pressure. it works. it can even help kids with middle ear fluid ear fullness due to colds/allergies and those adventuresome people who like to scuba dive. the device is not cheap (about $200) but neither is a trip to your doctor. if you have a child that is on the verge of getting tubes because of middle ear effusion (fluid) then this little device may delay or even eliminate the need for surgery. tube insertions although covered by most insurances costs several thousand dollars. i hadn’t thought much about the earpopper recently until i got a call from anya clowers rn who wrote the little book ""jet with kids"" – a brave woman who has traveled to over 16 countries with her child. she had been reading my blog reading the posting on my ears nose and throat community board and tracked me down. she is an expert on airline safety when it comes to kids. two enjoyable hours later we covered the gamut of flying with kids from picking the best airline seat restraints to using the earpopper. she loves this device and doesn’t leave home without it. we talked about airlines making my dirty dozen list as one of the most unsanitary places. you can just about count on kids getting sick when you travel. not only do kids practice third world hygiene they do not have the immune system that can withstand bombardment from the new pathogens they are likely to encounter on the way in the plane or once they arrive at the destination. every community has their own variety of circulating germs and it is those new germs that cause havoc a day or so after you arrive. parents need to just expect that kids will be getting sick and stop belly-aching (no pun intended) when the inevitable illness emerges."	what can i expect when traveling on planes with my young children?
i'm sorry to hear your husband's going through this. although i'm clearly not an orthopedic surgeon i may be able to shed some light on this. while there's no direct link between a lumbar laminectomy and bulging discs in the cervical spine it is possible that the patient could succumb to poor posture and body mechanics in order to relieve pain in the lumbar spine. this could in turn lead to upper-back pain (likely muscular not skeletal). in terms of how the laminectomy could ultimately cause problems farther up the spinal column here's what can happen. if you fuse two vertebrae together they cannot flex and bend naturally anymore. this puts a lot of stress on the vertebra directly above (in the case of lumber; below in the case of cervical) the fusion. after many years the battered vertebra or spinal disc can degenerate or collapse leading to the need for another laminectomy or fusion. this will again put stress on the next vertebra/disc up and so on. people who have vertebral fusions at a younger age run the risk of needing additional surgeries as the years go by due to the problems i described above. i have no idea if any of this is going on with your husband. it's highly unlikely his cervical spine problems are related to his lumbar laminectomy. nonetheless back problems stink and i hope he's able to find treatments that give him relief!	how lumbar injury affects cervical spine. my husband had a laminectomy after a disc ruptured & pieces entered the spinal column. a second laminectomy performed to remove remaining pieces. two years ago he required an xlif. he has problems with his cervical spine with some bulging discs. years ago his neurosurgeon told us eventually the damage could cause cervical and thorasic spine problems. a va dr. never heard of a connection between injury to the lumbar spine & problems with the cervical or thorasic spine. could you elaborate?

most helpful answer having a retained object in the rectum is no laughing matter. i understand why you'd feel scared. women face similar feelings about retaining tampons so you definitely are not alone. if you're very concerned that the condom is still inside you your best bet is to seek medical attention. let me assure you any health care professional worth their salt will treat your problem with dignity and concern. you need not feel embarrassed about this. if an otherwise healthy person were constipated and retaining stool in the rectum the obvious answer would be to use a liquid-based laxative such as magnesium citrate or polyethylene glycol (brand name miralax). however anyone with any medical condition compromised immune system or dehydration should not use these preparations without medical supervision. if you experience any abdominal bloating vomiting or fever please seek medical attention immediately. good luck to you!	how can you remove a condom that could possibly be stuck inside your buttocks? . i am not 100% sure if it is still inside me as i had gone to the bathroom and was not able to see if it came out. please help. would i still feel it? what would it feel like? will it come out by itself? how long would that take? im scared.

i had really bad anxiety in high school. when i was around 18 i had constant panic attacks. i was put on medication. it's possible your doctor feels that the medication is no longer necessary if your teen was on the medication long enough. also if your teen is trying new things to relieve their anxieties such as art music exercise. your teen needs a healthy way to relieve anxiety. therapy can help too. i would talk to your teen though to make sure it wasn't what they wanted. maybe your teen feels they don't need it and wants to be taken off the meds?	my teen has anxiety which is controlled by medication but dr wants to take him off the medication. why? is this safe? . my son was having hallucinations and was given antipsychotic meds 18 mos ago. 8 mos ago he was dx with anxiety and rx anxiety meds. he hasn't had hallucinations since. 2 months ago dr stopped antipsych meds. he is currently taking anxiety meds. hes doing very well and still no hallucinations. dr wants to lower dose of anxiety meds til he is no longer on med. his anixety was so severe it caused hallucinations. is it possible for a teen to outgrow anxiety to the point no med is necessary?
a 99. 5 temperature is normal for anyone. the average temperature is 98. 6 so this is just a one degree variation that doesn't mean you have a fever. temperatures also vary by time of day (lower in the morning; higher in the late afternoon); by as much as two degrees. if you are also tired and have an upset stomach you may be coming down with an illness; but not likely influenza. influenza is a respiratory disorder more associated with harsh coughing body aches headaches and a high fever.	is 99. 5 a normal temperature for a woman? . i'm afraid i mayhave a high temperature; i am also very tired and my stomach is kind of upset. do i have the flu or what?

"many people wonder if varicose veins can be a source of blood clots. the answer is ""not exactly. "" when people talk about ""blood clots "" they typically mean deep venous thromboses (dvt). these dangerous clots form in the deep tissue (typically of the calf muscle in the lower leg) and can break free and travel to the lungs causing a life-threatening pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung). varicose veins generally aren't linked to dvts. why is this so? well it's because varicose veins generally form in the superficial tissue not the deep tissue. as you can see by looking at your own legs those gnarled varicose veins reside near the surface of the skin. by definition these are not ""deep"" veins. because varicose veins are flabby blood can indeed pool in them and probably clot up. however this becomes a problem of the local tissue. these clots generally don't travel anywhere else in the body. varicose veins usually are considered a cosmetic problem even though they can cause pain and feelings of heaviness in the legs. varicose veins can run in families. if your leg veins are bothering you consult a physician who specializes in treating this problem. wishing you well!"	can varicose veins form a blood clot which can esentially cause a stroke? . i am a 52 year old female with varicose veins for approximately 20 years.

i'm sorry you're going through this. pain issues can negatively impact a person's quality of life and in your case you've had to reduce your running because of it. if it's been a year since you last saw the doctor about this it's time to go back. for one thing you now have additional symptoms in the knee and heel. for another thing even if the pain were confined to your hip the fact it has not gotten better over the course of a year means you deserve to have it re-checked. many conditions can cause the pains you've described. anything from sciatica to worn cartilage in the joints to arthritis could be the culprit. if you don't feel your doctor did an adequate job in diagnosing your condition feel free to get another opinion. i wish you all the best!	constant hips pain when i sit lay down ride in cars and after i run. this has been over a yr had no test dr sd deal. did run 3 xs a wk 2x a day to mntain my wght but now i run 1x a wk because the pain is bad after i run. when i lay dwn at night my hips constantly hurt and when i sit hurts worse when riding in car for a long period of x ie over an hr. does not hurt to touch. i can stand and touch my toes. i get some relief going to chiro. but it is temp. i went to my dr who has not done any test other than make me bend down touch my toes squats stretches. now my rt knee and rt heel hurt too.

hi this is from the uk's nhs as you said that you have a hernia. an inguinal hernia occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel such as the intestine pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. the hernia can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin or as an enlarged scrotum. the lump is often painless but it can become suddenly and severely painful if the blood supply to the section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation). so hence the pain and this would lead on to infertility. if its that bad and you want a child then its time to get it worked on. hope this helps you. good luck	does hernia caouse infertility? . hey there! i have hernia. there is pain in my scrotum. does it cause to infertility.?

the health reform law requires plans to allow children to stay on their parents' health plan until the age of 26 but that benefit does not extend to grandparents. however if you get insurance at work you should ask your human resources or benefits department. some employers will allow you to add a grandchild to your plan. and if you buy insurance on your own through one of the health insurance exchanges set up under the affordable care act you can also add your grandchild if you claim her as a dependent on your taxes. however we're now outside of the open enrollment period so the only way to add a family member is with an event that would trigger a special enrollment period -- say the birth of a child. just adding her now may not be possible. again you can contact healthcare. gov or call the 800 number (800-318-2596) to discuss your particular case.	am i able to add my granddaughter to my health insurance plan if she is in my care. she is 2 years old?

"hi this first piece of info is from the uk’s nhs it’s a bit like your abama scheme but has been running since the end of ww2. what if i didn’t have sex? it’s possible for you to get pregnant without having sexual intercourse (penetration) if for example: sperm get into your vagina – for example if you or your partner have semen or pre-ejaculate on your fingers and touch your vagina your partner ejaculates near your vagina your partner’s erect penis comes into contact with your body near your vagina the risk of getting pregnant in this way is very low because sperm can only live for a short time outside of the body. however if you’re not planning a pregnancy it’s important to know that it’s possible to get pregnant in this way. by the way are you natural with pubic hair or shaved? dr. hector chapa answered: if sperm gets around the outside of the vagina how likely is it to get pregnant? not likely for conception to occur several finely tuned processes must occur all in perfect order. first of which is cervical bathing/coating by sperm. the reason this is needed is because of all the volume deposited at the cervix some will leak out some will never enter the cervix some will die in the uterine cavity. sperm deposited on the exterior of the vagina can't ""migrate"" into the vaginal canal. dr. tony t. ho answered: my semen came into contact outside of her vagina by my penis i didn't release sperm there. she also has sist in her overy. could she get pregnant? always possible any time there is contact of semen to a woman's genital vault there is the possibility of pregnancy. it doesn't sound like it's very likely in this situation but you won't get a ""no it's not possible"" here. have her do a pregnancy test in 2 weeks to be sure. dr. ravi d. chauhan answered: if sperm gets on or around my vagina can i get pregnant? yes in a fertile woman any contact of sperm with the vaginal tissues can result in conception."	"anyone here who knows of a pregnancy due to ejaculant on fingers being rubbed on vagina during mutual masturbation? . i've read many many replies (on many websites) from doctors regarding the chances of getting pregnant by a small amount of ejaculant on one's hands being rubbed on the vaginal opening. some say ""yes possible b/c it only takes one sperm"" while some say ""very unlikely b/c sperm need to be inserted higher"". i'd like to know: 1) is there any medical professional here who actually knows of a pregnancy happening from such a situation? 2) are there any more scientific studies on this? thanks"

yes some anti-wrinkle products sold over the counter are effective. the ingredients that make your skin look more beautiful can be expensive but they don't have to be. look for products that contain antioxidant vitamins a (retinol) c and e; scientifically and clinically these antioxidants help stop free-radical damage that leads to fine lines and wrinkles. also ingredients such as matrixyl 3000 a peptide contribute to the production of collagen and elastin. they can plump up the skin matrix and actually make the skin visibly look younger. other ingredients such as licorice extract and niacin can help fight age spots that lead to uneven skin tone. the problem is finding the products that have the above ingredients in the right concentration to produce results. the longstanding results are definitely noticeable. it typically takes at least two to four weeks before you begin to see results so remember to wear sunscreen and start now!	are anti-wrinkle products sold over-the-counter effective?

"insomnia can be exceptionally difficult to live with. insomnia is often referred to as “vague” because it is so difficult to determine what is causing your sleeplessness: underlying medical conditions chronic pain depression or even another sleep disorder like restless leg syndrome. for some the cause could be as simple as stress. regardless of the cause all insomniacs know that it can be nearly impossible to fall asleep or fall back to sleep. if you have insomnia you may spend hours lying in bed tossing and turning trying desperately to fall asleep. you may even feel that doing so makes you feel even more stressed about not being asleep. a new study suggests that not only is that stress keeping you awake being in the bed itself might be contributing to your sleeplessness. in fact the researchers found that one of the best things to do is get out of bed. that will help you decrease the amount of stress you feel about not being asleep and may help you become more ready to fall asleep. if you are stressed or worried about other things finding ways to ""turn your brain off"" before you get into bed may be helpful. the medical staff involved in the study suggested that a consistent sleep routine is more likely than simply lying in bed to help you fall asleep and stay asleep. here are my top five tips to help you create and maintain a successful sleep routine: 1. set aside a power down hour before bedtime. stop work. no chores. do something relaxing like take a warm bath engage in light reading or watch tv if that’s relaxing for you (avoid the news channels). 2. go to bed and get up at the same time seven days a week — no matter what! 3. schedule in at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. you can break up these minutes into pockets of 10 minutes if you have to. here’s an idea: expose yourself to bright morning natural light (a good thing for calibrating the body’s natural clock) with a brisk walk before breakfast then again at lunch and after dinner. 4. avoid caffeine after 2 p. m. in the afternoon. don’t forget hidden sources like soda and some headache medicines. 5. adopt some mind- body- and sleep-friendly practices like meditation massage or yoga. it’s best to associate being in bed with being asleep not with being awake and stressing about not being asleep. a healthy sleep routine can help you do so and though it seems a little contradictory so can getting out of bed if you’re really struggling to fall asleep."	when should i get out of bed to encourage better sleeping?

yes active shingles (herpes zoster) is contagious by direct contact and sometimes even by indirect contact (hands objects clothing etc. ) if the exposure is fresh. infants have a very immature immune systems so exposure to herpes zoster may cause chicken pox (varicella) the same virus. a child over one year is likely to have had the varicella vaccine and would be less vulnerable but a child under age one is likely to be at risk. it would be best not to have direct contact with the baby at this time at least until you shingles has completely resolved. as a grandparent you can certainly see the baby. shingles is not airborne. since shingles can appear on many different body surfaces (chest back face etc. ) it is best to keep this area covered if possible until the lesions have resolved.	is it dangerous for my infant grandchild to be exposed to shingles?

"i'm sorry you're experiencing this. it's probably rather disturbing. of course there is no way to tell what is really going on without a physical exam. that said i think you probably are experiencing two separate but related conditions: dehydration and a hemorrhoid. you note you've been drinking little water and that your urine smells ""strong. "" you also note your stool has been pebble-like which can be a sign of constipation. based on this information i would surmise the ""tail-like"" protrusion at your anus is a varicose vein aka hemorrhoid. while most hemorrhoids do itch and/or bleed this is not always the case. i suggest you make an effort to drink more plain water. the ""eight glasses a day"" thing is a myth but you would do well to drink a few liters a day. note that other beverages don't count. coffee tea soda -- those are not substitutes for good old h2o. do not go out and start drinking gallons and gallons of water all at once! this can lead to a condition called ""water intoxication "" which is very dangerous. instead ramp up your water consumption by carrying a water bottle and keeping track of how many bottles you drink per day. when your urine is relatively clear and odorless and your stool is soft then you will know you are drinking enough water. as you rehydrate your body you may find the hemorrhoid may shrink and go away. if this doesn't occur then go see a health care professional for an evaluation. wishing you well!"

yowie! that sounds painful even to me. and i'm a girl. in terms of sterility i doubt this accident would impact your ability to father children. the penis is merely the delivery hose so to speak of the seminal fluid that contains sperm. the actual sperm (which are the key to fertility) are formed in the testes (testicles) and stored in the epididymis. depending on the severity of the injury i suppose it's possible you could have damaged a critical reproductive structure such as the vas deferens in your accident. it's not too late to have your injury evaluated. a competent urologist can examine you and run some tests to check the number of viable sperm in your ejaculate. this will tell you if you're fertile or not. hope this helps!	did my accident sterilize me? . 9 years ago i had an accident on my bike and my penis got caught in the pedal. no one took me to the doctor to get it checked out. can this interfere with me having children or something like that or is it no big deal.

"that is possible. if she has been showing progressive signs of puberty (breast development pubic hair etc. ) for a while a brown discharge could be a small amount of menstrual blood. the clear mucous-like or sticky discharge for the last six months could have been estrogenization (the body starting to produce estrogen). menarche (the beginning of menses) is unpredictable. sometimes these initial periods of spotting or discharge hallmark the beginning of regular cycles but may not. she could easily have a first period and then not have a next period for months. she may have not had ""the movie"" on puberty at school just yet so it will be up to you to address her questions and concerns (she will have many) or visit your local bookstore. there are some wonderful books for girls regarding this subject so think about buying her one to read in private. first periods can be exciting or frightening (or even both) so having some open communication with a mother or a caring older sister is essential. mark this brown spotting on the calendar and see what happens over the next few days or few months."	my daughter will be 10 in two weeks the last 2 days she has had brown discharge is this her period? . my daughter will turn 10 in a couple of weeks she is 58 inches tall under 100 pounds and very active ( a swimmer and dancer) she has been having clear discharge for about 6 months and the last 2 days it has been brown is this her period?

you need to make sure you keep your spine/back in a flat neutral position when you work out. if you don't you risk placing pressure on the spinal nerves which could cause the tingling you describe. of course it's possible the tingling is a normal part of working out too. whenever a person works the legs the muscles should feel somewhat painful or even tingly afterwards. that indicates you stressed the muscles well. but if you start having tingling or numbness in your lower extremities you should first assess the position of your back when you're working out. wishing you well!	i have been having tingling in my legs while sitting and laying down the last few days. i just started seeing a trainer. for the last 4 days my legs have had this tingling in my legs. it only happens when i am sitting down or in bed. when i am moving i am fine. i went to the doctor 2 days ago and she did not seem too concerned. she just told me to get some blood work done to check my vitamin levels. my eating habits are getting better i am trying to loose 30 pounds. i just started to see a trainer. we did mostly leg exercises so maybe i pinched something? that would be the only thing i can think of.

"i would not advise taking tylenol pm while you are pregnant due to the fact that it contains an antihistamine that is not recommended during pregnancy. it would be helpful to know your symptoms so we don't ""over-treat.

"yes you certainly can faint from freaking out. if i had a nickel for every patient who fainted from stress when receiving an injection or having an iv started i'd be one rich nurse! frequently when a person passes out from stress it's due to what's called a ""vasovagal response. "" this refers to a momentary malfunction of the parts of the nervous system (including the vagus nerve) that regulate the heart rate. heart slows down blood vessels dilate blood pressure drops and you pass out. however you seem to faint more than would normally be expected. vasovagal syncope (the fancy medical term for fainting while freaking out) usually requires a strong trigger. i would think back relaxation would bring on feelings of euphoria not stress that causes fainting. because you're still having fainting episodes after several months it's time to go back to the doctor to see if something besides a vasovagal response is causing this. also if you can feel a fainting episode coming on try to quickly sit down on the ground before you fall. and always try to protect your head. best to you!"	can you be so sressed or freaked out that you pass out completely? . this last spring i passed out randomly about 3 times in 2 weeks. i was very stressed and had a stomache virus. i went to the doctor and they drew blood when they did i passed out again. my heart rate dropped so low the doctor couldn't find it and he ordered a 24 hour heart monitor. the results came back with nothing wrong. just last week i passed out again after having some muscle relaxing treatment done on my back. i was freaked out by how relaxed my back was. could this cause me to pass out?
the dosage of tetracycline to treat acne would be more dependent on the type and severity of the acne than his weight. at 150 pounds your teen can take up to a full adult dose from 250 mg 4 times per day or even higher. some medical providers treating acne will only give it once or twice per day again depending on the current severity of the acne and the response to treatment. i don't typically use tetracycline; i use a similar drug called doxycyline that is much easier on the stomach and can be taken without regards to food.	what is the proper dose of tetracycline used for acne for a healthy male approx. 150 pounds
well i would suggest you simply eat a normal diet and follow the prep instructions to the letter. fasting before a colonoscopy may sound like a good idea but could actually backfire. abstaining from food or drink for 48 hours can have a profound effect on the digestive system and cause the prep solution(s) not to work correctly. so again my advice is to follow the written instructions you received. these instructions have helped thousands of patients achieve a good clean-out prior to colonoscopy and with luck they'll work for you too. here's hoping things go better this time around!	"will have a colonoscopy next week what do you suggest i eat this week before the test. in the past i have fasted 2 days and still failed to get ""good clean out"". is there a suggested diet i should follow this week before i go to clear liquids only for the 2 days before the test"
one of the potentials for danger is the manner in which crystal meth is used. individuals heat the drug and inhale the toxic fumes. these fumes affect the dopamine in brain which is released when the body experiences pleasure. crystal meth triggers that reaction which in turn produces more dopamine. over a long period of time the brain may suffer trauma from increased drug abuse which could lead to memory loss and emotional instability. studies by the international journal of drug policy have indicated that individuals who used crystal meth in large amounts even for very brief amounts of time experienced panic attacks paranoia violent behavior as well as irregular heart rate and chest pains. many individuals who abuse or are addicted to crystal meth often times result to illicit behavior in order to support their drug habit - which is not the best environment for children to be part of. as caretakers of children the best course of action is for the parents to stop using drugs and seek professional help. gallus detox centers is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	what effects does meth have on children when the parents smoke it around them im the grand father

one possibility for sudden excruciating foot pain (usually the big toe is the most painful) would be gout. assuming you are not having muscle cramps a spider bite or an injury this possibility would be high on my list. you would need to see your medical provider right away so that you can have a simple lab test. if your medical provider feels that you do have gout this can be promptly treated and you can get some immediate relief.	i woke up this morning with an excruciating pain in my foot. it is painful to touch and is hot to the touch. not a cramp. there are no marks or bruising. it feels like someone stomped down on it or like it may be broken. it gets really painful and throbs then it eases up a little but it doesn't go away.
it can be very. much a viral infection but if fever is not resolving then a blood test should be done to rule out the cause of the problem and treatment can be done accordingly. as of now you should continue taking a combination of tylenol and ibuprofen. do cool compresses over the forehead and extremities. hope this helps.

a diet rich in calcium and vitamin d can help counteract the bone-damaging effects of corticosteroids. diet can also be helpful in combatting other drug side effects. for example a low-sodium diet can help reduce fluid retention and lower blood pressure which can be elevated with corticosteroid use. a diet high in folic acid such as found in leafy green vegetables fruits and fortified breads and cereals or a folic acid supplement is important if you are taking methotrexate (rheumatrex). for nausea caused by medications eat small frequent meals and foods that are easy to digest. try dry cereals breads and crackers. also avoid greasy spicy and acidic foods. if corticosteroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (motrin) or naproxen (naprosyn) cause stomach upset and irritation taking them with meals can help.	can diet help counteract the side effects of lupus medications?
