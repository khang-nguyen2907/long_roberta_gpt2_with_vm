is he passing stools? this is a very important question because if he is not then it may point to obstruction. another possibility is that there may be some mild gastritis. you can manage the pain by giving syrup colicaid (simethicone) 5 ml only when there is the pain. for the vomiting you can give syrup ondem (ondansetron) 5 ml thrice a day for three days. wait for at least half an hour after giving ondem to give any food or water. i would also prefer if you get him evaluated physically since he is lethargic you said. he may be dehydrated. for further information consult a paediatrician online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My son is 4 years old.

a positive test result for double-stranded dna (dsdna) antibodies is consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. but it must be correlated with a person who has clinical signs and symptoms that suggest lupus. as the presence of this anti-dsdna can indicate a higher risk of lupus nephritis kidney inflammation that can occur with lupus. this test can confirm the need to closely monitor the kidneys. only half the people with lupus have a positive test so a positive or negative test does not mean you have lupus.

"losing weight can seem like an insurmountable task especially when you have a significant weight loss goal. but it turns out most people bounce around within a range of about 10 pounds -- depending on the time of year their motivation to exercise and whether a high school reunion is around the corner. it's amazing to consider what gaining or losing just 10 pounds can do for you. a study recently presented at the american heart association scientific sessions found that for every nine-pound increase in body weight a person's risk of developing heart disease increases by 50%. researchers tracked height weight and heart disease in over 80 000 people and found that there is a direct cause-and-effect link between body weight and this increase in heart disease. i find when advising patients about weight loss that there are several ways to encourage success. the first is to have a goal. not just a weight goal but also a health goal. we spend so much time concentrating on the ""how-to"" that we sometimes forget about the ""to-what. "" reducing your risk of heart disease is a tangible and realistic goal. second think small. when we feel motivated to lose weight and get healthy our enthusiasm sometimes gets the best of us and we set our goals to lofty heights. the problem with lofty goals is that it's harder to reach them and easier to get discouraged and go back to less healthy behaviors. so think small. ten pounds is a great place to start. you can tackle your first 10 pounds with these three easy weight-loss tips. 1. keep a food diary. record every single thing you eat and drink. studies show that this is the single most effective weight-loss tactic. the act of documenting your meals will impact the food choices you make. 2. weigh yourself -- every day. keeping close tabs on your weight will keep you honest with yourself and warn you if you start to stray in the wrong direction. 3. get enough sleep. research shows that sleeping more than seven hours each night is associated with weight loss. sleep tips your hunger hormones in the right direction."	can losing 10 pounds make a difference?

the symptoms you have mentioned here are indicating towards a migraine headache. however no diagnostic test can surely rule out a migraine. its diagnosis is mainly based on the symptoms. in a migraine there is no definite pain and pain occurs at any time. some people say that a migraine usually occurs on one side of the head and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting but this is not true in all cases. the pain can be all over the head and other symptoms might be present or absent. i suggest you try doing the following. wear sunglasses cover your head with a scarf and use an umbrella whenever you go out in the sun. before going outside always drink one glass of water it will keep you hydrated and will help you. you can take sandalwood oil and massage your scalp a night before washing your hair. avoid excessive intake of tea coffee and caffeinated drinks. some foods also increase the problem of headaches so avoid those. avoid using perfumes deodorant sprays etc. as strong smell may exaggerate the problem. avoid stress anxiety and loud noises. follow a particular sleep pattern i mean try to sleep daily around the same time. if possible try to avoid mobile television laptop etc. an hour before sleep as these emit blue light which hinders normal sleep pattern and also promotes headaches. pranayam is helpful in headaches. so if you can spare 5 to 10 minutes then practice it daily. in medications i suggest you try taking the following. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. pathyadi kwath 15 to 20 ml with an equal amount of water twice a day for six weeks. godanti bhasma 250 mg with water twice a day for four to six weeks. it is an ayurvedic painkiller. shir shuladi vajra ras two tablets twice a day with water for four to six weeks. this ayurvedic medicine is also a painkiller and is used in headaches of various etiology. if you find it tedious to take multiple medicines then you can take only one of these two painkillers or can take two of them for one month. kamdudha ras 250 mg twice a day with water for four to six weeks. it will help in cooling you down internally. take anu taila and put one drop of this oil in each nostril once a day for one month. take powder of sandalwood camphor and jatamansi and. mix all in equal amount and add water or rose water and apply this paste on the forehead while you have a headache. take one teaspoon of coriander powder and add it in one cup of water and keep it for a night. drink it early in the morning on an empty stomach. if you are taking allopathic medicine then take above medicine along with that after consulting your physician. however for a migraine there is no curative treatment. it can only be avoided with the help of medicines and lifestyle changes and sometimes the headache may not disturb you for so long and sometimes may trouble you often so follow a healthy way of life. also stop these medicines during your periods. you can start them after the period gets over. i hope you are satisfied with my answer. for further queries consult an ayurveda specialist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I get headaches, especially when I wash my hair or when I go out in the sun.

olive oil is a fat and like any fat contains about 100 calories per tablespoon. so keep in mind: olive oil is just as caloric as other fats and can contribute to weight gain if consumed in high amounts. olive oil does contain heart-healthy fats which are associated with lower blood cholesterol levels. but you can't just pour olive oil all over an otherwise unhealthy diet and expect your cholesterol levels to suddenly go down. making dietary changes to control your cholesterol levels is a twofold process. first increase the amount of fiber in your diet such as the fiber found in oatmeal fruits and vegetables. second decrease the amount of animal fats and saturated fats you consume such as the fats found in butter whole milk cream sausage bacon and heavily marbled cuts of beef. exercise is also good for your heart health and cardiovascular function. but you have to address any issues with your diet. i suggest using olive oil-based cooking sprays to sauté your vegetables as well as using olive oil as a salad dressing base. canola oil is a good choice as well.	i want to know if adding olive oil to my diet could help lower my cholesterol.

for a temporary change the obvious answer is to use a commercial lip plumper and see how it goes. more and more cosmetics companies are bringing out lip plumpers some already tinted some not. lip plumpers can be surprisingly effective; in a few cases users not only get strikingly fuller lips but the results last up to eight hours as well. to be honest though the effects of most lip plumpers rarely last more than an hour especially if users eat or drink. most lip plumpers use an irritant such as cinnamon wintergreen or ginger that causes enough of a reaction to make the lips swell and look temporarily fuller. some of them especially those with higher concentrations of cinnamon and wintergreen can really make the lips burn sometimes quite painfully. and that burning sensation applies not only to the woman who used a plumper on her lips but to anybody she kisses as well. if your significant other is allergic i’d stay away from these plumpers; obviously people with sensitive skin should also avoid them because they may get a whole lot more than they bargained for. never use lip plumpers on cracked lips or on cold sores because the pain can be excruciating. less irritating plumpers are those with retinol or oligopeptides both of which stimulate collagen production. the advantage to these plumpers is that with repeated use lips will not only look fuller but smoother and less wrinkled. a warning: retinol increases sun sensitivity. i recommend that lip plumpers with retinol be used only at night. for a longer-lasting look you’d have to go with fillers usually hyaluronic acid fillers; my two favorites are prevelle silk and juvederm. in my experience prevelle silk gives a more subtle look while juvederm lasts longer. these lip fillers cost $750- $1000 and last three to four months. some people just want to define their lips so they get a tiny amount of filler injected all around the lip border; their lips stand out more but without added volume. this technique is especially popular with women over forty because the lip border becomes less distinct with age. i would never ever recommend more permanent procedures such as silicone injections or lip implants. with silicone injections problems such as lumps and irregular or asymmetrical lips are actually pretty common and lip implants frequently look artificial. think before you get lip fillers. if you want to see how you would look with fuller lips then try lip plumpers first and see if you like the way you look. when buying a lip plumper or any other beauty product try to read and decipher the ingredients contained in the product in order to see how the plumping or moisturising will occur. also remember that most lip plumpers will eventually result in drying of the lips as most of the plumping ingredients act as an irritant to the lips therefore resulting in the plumping. these products typically work by irritating the thin delicate skin of the lips with ingredients like menthol or camphor. this makes the lips swell slightly which may also diminish the appearance of fine lines in that area. lip filler procedures provide immediate results that should last for up to six months after which time you may need a top-up to maintain the volume. initially there will be some swelling and sometimes bruising in the lip area from the injections. this should quickly subside to reveal your full and plump lips. some of the most common side effects of collagen lip injections are instances where lips swell or bruise after treatment. there can also be bruising around the sides of the mouth depending on the material that is used and the method of injection as well as how the body handles the foreign material. some patients can be allergic to some aspects of collagen lip injections and that can cause excessive swelling or related side effects it’s generally not a good idea to ignore the warning signs of complications from this process which could cause a patient long-term harm. consult a doctor before selecting one of these treatments to talk about lip injections or lip plumpers and what kinds of potential side effects may result.	i want larger-looking lips. should i go with a lip plumper or filler?

unfortunately most cancers of the esophagus are detected too late to be treated effectively. by the time cancer-related symptoms of chest pain weight loss and progressive difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) lead to the diagnosis the cancer has already spread beyond the esophagus to other organs. indeed there is evidence that survival is markedly improved in cancers detected during the course of surveillance for dysplasia or cancer in barrett's esophagus as compared with survival in cancers detected after cancer symptoms prompted medical attention. therefore physicians want to make the diagnosis of barrett's in gerd patients and then begin surveillance for cancer in such patients. the problem however as mentioned previously is that only 5% of all patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or cardia have had an endoscopy to show that they have barrett's esophagus. thus the challenge is to identify those gerd patients who have barrett's by screening patients with chronic gerd. yet sufficient research has not been done to establish guidelines for selecting which patients with gerd should be screened by endoscopy. for now until more data becomes available it seems reasonable that if a patient with gerd cannot be taken off acid-suppressing drugs after two to three years (because of persistent symptoms) an endoscopy should be done to see if barrett's esophagus is present. one endoscopy per lifetime in patients with gerd may be sufficient to screen for barrett's.	why is it important to screen patients with gerd to diagnose barrett's esophagus?
now. penicillin never works for tonsil stones. the problem is that your tonsils have holes/crypts in them that trap food and other debris. gargling after every meal will limit the accumulation of debris or you can take a moistened q-tip (or your finger) and physicallyl dislodge them. they will come back again however. the only definitive cure is to remove the tonsils if you and your ent can convince the insurance company that this is medically-necessary.	when should i see a throat specialist when the tonsil stones wont go away and the penisillin doesnt work? . no fever hurts bad when swallowing red sore throat. tried to knock off the white things on tonsils and ovula as the urgent care dr said to try. been on penicillin since tuesday feb. 5th. no better as of yet. when do you think i should see a throat specialist?

hyperpigmentation discoloration or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (pih) on your skin can be attributed to a variety of disorders. i like to begin with excluding any medical reasons that may result in hyperpigmentation. hyperpigmentation may be attributed to renal disease diabetes or peripheral vascular disease. pih arises from an acquired excess of pigment related to an inflammatory process such as infection an allergic reaction a reaction to medication or a trauma. pih often occurs as a consequence of inflammatory skin disorders including acne drug-induced eruptions and eczema. once you have excluded medical causes there are multiple options to regain your even skin tone. a combination of glycolic acid aha and tretinoin-based products -- along with a traditional topical skin care regimen -- will work for skin brightening. hydroquinone-based products work well. however there are other alternatives such as bearberry kojic acid licorice extract and niacin. these compounds will work towards brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone. the key is to work with a physician that is very familiar with your skin type and color because incorrect use of these agents can lead to further hypo- or hyperpigmentation. i tell my african-american patients in particular that in order to get your skin in shape it has to be a gradual process similar to exercising. you would not attempt to lift 250 lbs on the first day of your workout; this attempt may lead to injuring yourself and disastrous results. the same holds true with your skin regimen a gradual approach is always best. once you get your melanocytes in shape and under control you can improve your skin tone.	what can i do about the dark circles under my eyes?

it's difficult to say exactly why your wife isn't losing weight without more information but here are some things to consider: how is she tracking her calories? it is possible that she is getting more than she thinks she is. seeing a registered dietitian can help her examine her food intake for hidden calories. high levels of activity mixed with low calorie intake may increase cortisol (levels stress hormone) and cause weight to stay where it is. this is a theory but i have seen it many times. your wife can experiment with cutting back the exercise or increasing her calorie intake. unless she's enjoying the exercise it likely isn't sustainable so i suggest she focused on doing something she enjoys. if your wife did not exercise at all before it is possible she is gaining some muscle mass and losing fat even the scale isn't moving. other factors can cause weight to plateau such as stress and lack of sleep. see this webmd article for more ideas. weight loss -- and especially weight loss maintenance -- can be a challenging task. i suggest your wife get help and support with the process. the key is to address the reasons for the weight gain in addition to tackling food and exercise.	my wife weighs 242lbs she only eats about 1500 calories a day and excercises. why can't she lose weight? . . my wife is 5ft 4inches tall weighs 242lbs and is a size 14-16 in pants sizes. she only eats about 1500 calories a day and exercises about 90+ minutes a day burning 800-1200 calories. she has been doing this for about 2 months and hasn't lost any weight. she has been diagnosed with ibs. she also has be test for hypothyroids and was negative. . .

medical researchers aren't sure exactly how stress increases the risk of heart disease. stress itself might be a risk factor or it could be that high levels of stress make other risk factors (such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure) worse. for example if you are under stress your blood pressure goes up you may overeat you may exercise less and you may be more likely to smoke. if stress itself is a risk factor for heart disease it could be because chronic stress exposes your body to unhealthy persistently elevated levels of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. studies also link stress to changes in the way blood clots which increases the risk of heart attack.	how does stress contribute to heart disease?

unfortunately without the ability to actually see this skin eruption that you are describing it would be very difficult if not impossible to blindly offer an accurate diagnosis. a diagnosis is really essential when it comes to treatment. knowing your medical history will also help solve this mystery rash. based solely on your description this could be an allergic reaction perhaps urticaria (hives). hives are intensely itchy comes on suddenly and if the allergen is still in your midst it can continue to persist/spread. regardless of the cause (which can be very challenging to find) the itchiness can be treated with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine (benadryl) or other over-the-counter medications in this class. seeing a medical provider is important since many things can mimic hives. this sounds like pitariasis rosea. which usually spreads to the trunk of the body. bathe in selson blue it could be from a plant or some kind of poison oak that you wern't aware of may be in your yard? some body's house or being out in the woods you have the same thing almost like i have going on with me. but mine is on my right inner thigh itchy raised dry rash. i'm just using over the counter anti-itch cream good luck.	i have a skin rash that looks like ringworm but isn't. its red and very itchy and spreading everywhere. what can i do? . my breakout started with one bump on my thigh then a day later there were two on my upper body. then all of a sudden the next week my whole upper body was covered in red raised and itchy bumps. i am into my second week with this and it is spreading to my face all over my arms and moving down my legs. i am not in pain but it is hard to deal with being itchy everywhere. i don't have any other symptoms. if there was a way to know what i have? just anything to help thank you.

hi first lets get your meds sorted out by going to your doctor with a list of what your taken and why just to see if there's any overlap no way should you be getting this problem if your meds are right. as for getting diarrhoea that bad it well do this to your body it drags the body down you do need to replace liquids so drink plenty of water see your chemist about rehydration powders these will help you. hope this helps you. good luck ps if you want to? spend time cross matching your meds for reactions see what that throw's up. sorry for the pun.	why do i get so ill when i get diarrhea. hello i take a lot of medications which cause me to be constipated so every so often i get terrible diarrhea. when this happens i get sick to my stomach to the point that i think that i am going to throw up and or pass out my body feels like it is on fire and i sweat so bad that my entire body is sopping wet the sweat is so bad it can almost form a puddle on the floor from my face. can you please tell me what is happening to my body at this time. thank you dana

hi. i had a similar experience when i was pregnant with my daughter. i went to the hospital for cramping/lower back pain. they saw the yolk sac but no baby or heart beat. i went to my ob/gyn 2 weeks later and they said that the fetus won't have a heartbeat until the 8-9 week mark. and by then movement may also be seen. needless to say my daughter is now 6 months old and very healthy! don't worry. i am sure your baby is fine! congratulations!	is it normal to not see a heart beat or movement on an ultrasound around the 6-7 week mark?
hi the second feeling your getting could be that you want to squirt or to female ejaculate yes you females can do that but unlike men its a clear fluid so next time your having sex put a towel under you and after you have urinated the next feeling just let yourself go you may enjoy it. but your first feeling could be from him hitting you bladder and you may also be getting some g spot stimulation as well. good luck	when having sex i feel the need to pee i get up and go but still feel the pressure that i have to go. when having sex i feel the need to go pee i get up to go and it feels better but about 10 mins later i feel the need to go again. even when i am not having sex and i go to the bathroom it does not hurt or burn to pee but i still feel the pressure of having to go. i have googled this and have only gotten as far as his penis is big and is hitting the bladder wall and making me have the sensation to pee. this has just never happened to me before and we have been together for about 2 months now.
unfortunately you can. genital herpes can end up on your mouth through oral sex for instance. and it is possible for this to happen even when you do not have active lesions. this is the chance that you will both need to take if this was your underlying concern. you have most likely seen many people with cold sores/or fever blisters. these are typically type 1 herpes lesions but you can get type 2 lesions (genital types) on your mouth. with that said you are both actively producing antibodies to suppress the genital outbreaks. theoretically this should limit the spread to other areas but not totally eliminate the possibility. the fact that you both have herpes not at least solves part of the problem. if one of you has active lesions i am sure that sexual activity would not be high on your to-do list at least until you are better. are you both taking suppression drugs? these are daily anti-herpes medicines you can take to limit recurrent outbreaks.	herpes transmission somewhat complicated question. i have genital herpes but no outbreaks after the initial one. my partner got it from me and has genital outbreaks. we're wondering if we're able to spread it to each other in areas where we haven't had outbreaks during shedding (not active outbreak). seems obvious that we could spread it around while there are lesions so we're careful during her outbreaks. but the big mystery is . can we spread it to new areas during shedding. . ? . thanks a million. we've been searching hard for the answer. .

palliative care and hospice care often are mentioned in the same sentence as if they are the same thing. they are not but they do share certain characteristics. hospice is care for people at the end of their lives and their families. hospice care encompasses physical emotional and spiritual support. it is not offered only to the dying person but to the entire family as well. hospice care is not about prolonging life; it is about providing comfort care and measures designed to enhance the dying person's quality of life. and this is the point where hospice and palliative care overlap. palliative care too is about maximizing a person's quality of life. however palliative care is not just for patients with limited life expectancy. any person with a serious illness or chronic medical condition may benefit from palliative care. palliative care takes a holistic approach to addressing pain--physical and/or emotional--and other issues of comfort. for example a palliative physician might order special skin creams to minimize the pain and tissue irritation from radiation therapy for cancer. palliative team members may include specially trained physicians nurses psychotherapists social workers physical therapist occupational therapists nursing assistants and others. this team focuses treatment on the patient but also offers support to family members. i hope this helps!	compare palliative with hospice care

"strategies for fighting diabetes are pretty much the same as the strategies for fighting diabetic kidney disease. doctors and patients try to keep the blood sugar levels and blood pressure levels in excellent control because high glucose and/or blood pressure can accelerate the damage. an eating and exercise strategy designed to reverse the diabetes as much as possible is a top priority for slowing the kidney damage. this would involve losing as much excess body fat as possible and keeping your muscles heart and lungs in shape via cardio and resistance exercise. there are many good eating strategies. avoiding excess starch sugar and animal fat are the top priorities in my view. avoiding excess salt and protein may also slow the kidney disease. . a good way to follow the kidney disease progression or slowing is via the urine protein levels as well as the ""glomerular filtration rate"" (gfr) test."	i am a type 2 diabetic and my kidneys are in the beginning stages of breakdown. how can i slow that process?

one of the potentials for danger is the manner in which crystal meth is used. individuals heat the drug and inhale the toxic fumes. these fumes affect the dopamine in brain which is released when the body experiences pleasure. crystal meth triggers that reaction which in turn produces more dopamine. over a long period of time the brain may suffer trauma from increased drug abuse which could lead to memory loss and emotional instability. studies by the international journal of drug policy have indicated that individuals who used crystal meth in large amounts even for very brief amounts of time experienced panic attacks paranoia violent behavior as well as irregular heart rate and chest pains. many individuals who abuse or are addicted to crystal meth often times result to illicit behavior in order to support their drug habit - which is not the best environment for children to be part of. as caretakers of children the best course of action is for the parents to stop using drugs and seek professional help. gallus detox centers is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	what effects does meth have on children when the parents smoke it around them im the grand father
you need to make sure you keep your spine/back in a flat neutral position when you work out. if you don't you risk placing pressure on the spinal nerves which could cause the tingling you describe. of course it's possible the tingling is a normal part of working out too. whenever a person works the legs the muscles should feel somewhat painful or even tingly afterwards. that indicates you stressed the muscles well. but if you start having tingling or numbness in your lower extremities you should first assess the position of your back when you're working out. wishing you well!	i have been having tingling in my legs while sitting and laying down the last few days. i just started seeing a trainer. for the last 4 days my legs have had this tingling in my legs. it only happens when i am sitting down or in bed. when i am moving i am fine. i went to the doctor 2 days ago and she did not seem too concerned. she just told me to get some blood work done to check my vitamin levels. my eating habits are getting better i am trying to loose 30 pounds. i just started to see a trainer. we did mostly leg exercises so maybe i pinched something? that would be the only thing i can think of.

i'm sorry you're going through this. it's always scary when we have a problem with our eyes! the first thing to clarify is this: is it your actual eyeball that's twitching? or is it your eyelid? twitching of the eyelid is called blepharospasm and is quite common. it tends to come and go as you described. it can get worse and more frequent from time to time and then clear up for long periods. stress fatigue and caffeine are common culprits of blepharospasm. if it's your eyeball that's twitching that would be more worrisome to me. when a person's eyeballs twitch it's usually both of them. if your eyeball itself is the problem i'd advise you to see a doctor. i realize you said you don't have insurance but most communities have free or low-cost health care clinics. you could start by getting checked at one of those just to calm any fears you may have about this situation. i wish you all the best!	why is my right eyeball twitching? . started almost a year ago. very random. it has gotten more and more frequent over the last few weeks. now its more than a few times a day. no redness or swelling or tearing or any other symptoms. i do have astigmatism and when it does twitch my vision blurs slightly. no insurance though so i cannot even have it checked out til march. worried it could be something serious. would appreciate some advice.

"it depends how long after actual ovulation. if one knows the actual date of ovulation conception can occur up to 72 hours after ovulation as sperm can live inside the cervix for up to 72 hours under ideal conditions. an oocyte/egg has at least a 48 hour lifespan after ovulation. as you may know the most likely time to conceive is about 14 days before the start of your next period. so if one had a regular 28 day cycle ovulation is around day 14; a regular 34 day cycle will have an ovulation around day 20. if one has a regular 24 day cycle ovulation can be as early as cycle day 10. the problem arises among women who have periods/bleeds which are not linked to an ovulation. these ""non-ovulatory bleeds"" can occur randomly as the too thick lining of the uterus begins to shed on its own. the woman in this case could have a bleed and then an ovulation anytime thereafter. an even more risky scenario would be the women who mistakes bleeding associated with the release of an egg/oocyte as a period. in that case she could get pregnant from intercourse during her ""supposed period"" because she is actually at a very fertile time. bottom line getting pregnant during a ""real"" period is unlikely--especially if it has been 14 days since ovulation occurred. if [there is a concern] do a reliable pregnancy test about two weeks after the date of intercourse. a urine test should be reliable around the time of [the] expected period. lastly if a woman is really scared about having an unplanned pregnancy the worry can cause her flow to be late. . a urine pregnancy test can help resolve any concerns."	can a women get pregnant after ovulation and while she is having her period?
"most helpful answer it would take a visual examination by a medical provider to determine the exact nature of your scrotal ""red blotch"". a brief description just doesn't do it. you may be correct about fungus -- common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris. tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated. another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap. no young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated. jock itch is a possibility. however that rash is usually itchy so that makes me question whether you have jock itch or something else. since i cannot tell based on your description it is something you should get checked out by your doctor. here is more information about jock itch. thank you very much for your input i have determined that it is jock itch and am getting a corticosteroid and some fungal cream as well"	what does it mean when there is a red blotch on your scrotum? . hello i am a 16 year old male and just recently found a red blotch on my scrotum it isn't itchy and it is always moist i am not sure if the moisture is puss or sweat i think it might be some fungal infection or just jock rash but can someone tell me what i might have?

"scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. most scientists agree that there is no single cause. rather many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. genetics bipolar disorder tends to run in families so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. genes are the ""building blocks"" of heredity. they help control how the body and brain work and grow. genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. however most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness."	what are the risk factors for bipolar disorder?

arthritis is inflammation in a joint. diagnosis is based on a history of joint pain stiffness and/or warmth redness or swelling and physical examination. the examination can demonstrate swelling and often limited range of motion of the joint. x-ray examination can support the diagnosis and often disclose the type of arthritis and it's severity. early diagnosis is important for early treatment. many types of arthritis can progress without treatment. this can lead to permanent destruction of cartilage bone and ligaments which can result in deformity and loss of function that is not reversible. moreover some forms of arthritis are associated with disease elsewhere in the body. to avoid injury to other body tissues early diagnosis can be crucial.	how is arthritis diagnosed?
"blood pressure is a measure of how hard your blood pushes against the walls of your arteries. if the force is too hard you have high blood pressure (also called hypertension ). when high blood pressure starts after 20 weeks of pregnancy it may be a sign of a very serious problem called preeclampsia. blood pressure is shown as two numbers. the top number ( systolic ) is the pressure when the heart pumps blood. the bottom number ( diastolic ) is the pressure when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. blood pressure is high if the top number is more than 140 millimeters of mercury (mm hg) or if the bottom number is more than 90 mm hg. for example blood pressure of 150/85 (say ""150 over 85"") or 140/95 is high. or both numbers can be high such as 150/95. a woman may have high blood pressure before she gets pregnant. or her blood pressure may start to go up during pregnancy. if you have high blood pressure during pregnancy you need to have checkups more often than women who do not have this problem. there is no way to know if you will get preeclampsia. this is one of the reasons that you are watched closely during your pregnancy. high blood pressure and preeclampsia are related but they have some differences. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."	what are high blood pressure and preeclampsia?

hand washing. both flu and cold viruses are transmitted through microscopic droplets from an infected person's respiratory system. if people cough or sneeze into their hands (without a tissue) they can contaminate every surface they touch. if you touch that same surface you pick up the virus. if you rub your eyes or nose you've just infected yourself. to protect yourself and prevent spread of cold and flu viruses: wash your hands frequently. use an alcohol-based gel if you don't have access to water. cough and sneeze into a tissue or into your hands. wash your hands afterward. when you cough turn your head away from others. if you have a sudden sneeze bend your arm and sneeze into it. don't touch your eyes nose or mouth. wash any shared surfaces (like phones and keyboards) frequently. viruses can live on surfaces for several hours. stay away from crowds during cold and flu season.	how can i prevent a cold?
