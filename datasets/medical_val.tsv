answer	question
baby: your baby measures about 5. 2 to 6 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 7 ounces. skin is developing and transparent appearing red because blood vessels are visible through it. creamy white protective coating called vernix begins to develop. mom-to-be: as your baby continues to grow you may be feeling some mid-pregnancy aches and pains by now -- lower abdominal achiness dizziness heartburn constipation leg cramps mild swelling of ankles and feet and a backache. dilated blood vessels might cause tiny temporary red marks (called spider nevi) on your face shoulders and arms. tip of the week: take care not to get overtired since rapid growth of the baby can compound the burden on your heart lungs and kidneys.	what can i expect during week 19 of my pregnancy?

sorry there are no doctors here who can prescribe for you. if you have a bad sinus infection try to get to urgent care at the very least because you need to know what kind of infection you have and they can get you the right antibiotics for it. i've beat more than a few sinus infections with lots of hot showers decongestant nasal spray to let the sinuses drain sometimes even sinus rinses and lots of hot soup with garlic. it's something of a natural antibiotic.	i have a terrible sinus infection. could i please get an antibiotic called in asap? thank you.
"apparently dr. oz just did a piece about ""the triangle of death""--that area from between your eyes to just below the corners of your mouth. most people will have their hands in and around there doing something either consciously or sub-consciously at least once a day. pulling nose hair and popping zits on the nose and near the lips can easily lead to infection including infections that can spread to the brain. i'm not suggesting you did any of those things but swelling is a common sign of infection. i would see a doctor asap. here is some more information i just googled using the words: pulling nose hairs infection swollen good luck and take care!"	my nose swelled up and began bruising when will the swelling go down? . yesterday i got punched in the face i've never bled from my nose this was the first time. immediately one side of the nasal ridge began to swell up. i iced it for 20 on 20 off and took ibuprofen. later the other side of the ridge swelled up then the top of the bridge and around my eyes. i iced around my entire face. i woke up this morning with bruises underneath both eyes. you can follow a straight line through the ridge until the tip. please help how can i make the swelling go down quickly?

"here's the new reality: we're all paying more for fewer health benefits. a 2010 employer health benefits survey conducted by the kaiser family foundation found that employees paid 14% more for family health coverage last year than just one year before. and an online survey just out from glassdoor. com found that cuts to health and dental benefits were on the rise during the last quarter of 2010 with more than 11% of employees surveyed seeing their benefits reduced in the past six months. what's driving costs skyward? experts cite a mix of inefficiencies within the health-care system a growing use of medical technology an aging population widespread chronic disease medical malpractice and rising prescription drug costs. all this has prompted many people to ask: ""how can i save money on my health care? "" here a few cost-saving tips to consider: negotiate. ask your doctor hospital or lab upfront how much your care will cost and then ask for a better price. to find out what's reasonable for the type of care you need you can use online tools such as healthcare blue book and vimo. be sure to ask your provider for the cpt code (common procedural terminology) that corresponds to the service you need so you can be sure you're getting an accurate comparison. some large insurers also make costs of care available to their members online. if the procedure you want or need isn't covered by your insurance plan (or you have no insurance) ask for the same rate the provider would give an insurance company. and make sure you get the agreed-upon rate in writing. most providers have their billing done by a billing company. you may need to show proof of your agreement to billing staff who didn't get the message from the doctor. pay cash: doctors like everyone else prefer to be paid right away for the services they provide. offering to pay in cash for your treatment prevents your doctor or hospital from having to bill you or wait for full payment. that convenience can put you in a stronger position to negotiate a better price on your care. watch your location: you'll pay more for the same lab work done at a hospital than you would if you had your blood drawn at a free-standing lab or your doctor's office. talk with your doctor about alternative and less expensive sites for treatment. review your bills. as i've talked about before. a large percentage of medical bills contain inaccuracies. always check for duplicate or inappropriate charges before you pay any bills. save on prescription drugs: be sure to shop for the best price on your medications because costs vary widely among different pharmacies. you can compare drug prices side-by-side among many pharmacies at both planprescriber. com and pharmacychecker. com. the national association of boards of pharmacy offers listings of online pharmacies it has accredited."	how can i save money on my health insurance?
if you get a persistent or painful erection which is called priapism you need to be seen right away. believe it or not it’s common enough that everyone in the er will have seen it they’ll get you in. the doctors will first try to ice you up hoping that they can chill it. sometimes you can even squeeze the blood out and the erection will fade and that’s actually a good sign though it can be horribly painful. there are these phaso-dilators medications that will allow the blood vessels to expand to allow the blood to leave they can have you inhale those and sometimes that works. if that doesn’t work and the other techniques don’t work then usually the urologist will have to go in and actually extract the old thick blood causing the erection to go away and sometimes put in some fresh fluids to try to get the old sludging fluid to leave. we numb up the skin put in a needle and basically aspirate out pull out the old thick blood that’s no longer oxygenated it’s just static and getting old. and that allows the erection to fade and usually in a very short time men have resolution of the pain. the great thing about it is the sooner you act the better your chance for a normal sex life in the future. if you wait and i’ve seen some men that wait for 24 hours then your risk for complications permanent scarring permanent damage go way up.	what treatment can i expect at the er for my painful erection?

as a warning to others and regarding the last responder it's a really bad idea to buy accutane or any of its equavlents from a no-prescription online pharmacy. this is because there is a lot of medical oversight needed for the safety of the patient and if you get pregnant while taking the stuff you can end up with some really serious birth defects in the fetus. it's also meant to be taken in a very specific way and it's not suited to be self administered. add this to the inherent danger of online no prescription required pharmacies and you have a very bad combination. by the way taking this without a prescription is illegal in the us and quite a few other countries and for once i agree with that.	i am 17 year teen boy. i have been getting acne on my face from last 3 years. what should i do? . well i am getting acne on my face continuously. i tried various products but none of them worked. 3 years i have been through this. i also have problem of more than average sweating. are they interrelated? what should i do to stop acne?

i know it's hard to justify when you get a new medication and it's expensive. but this medication might be the right medication and in the long run might actually save you money. this is a once-a-day medication it's used for depression. and if it helps you and it makes you feel better then that's a good price to pay. when you don't feel well with depression and you don't take these types of medications and you take some that have to be taken more frequently or might have more side-effects you forget to take them. therefore if there is a price on your quality of life and then also you are going to see the doctor more often which means that your overall healthcare costs are actually going up. so there are patient assistance programs available through the manufacturers patients may want to look into that as helping offset the cost of that medication. at the end of the day it might be the right fit.	my doctor has given me a really expensive medication pristiq. are there any ways to reduce those costs?

there is two basic types of targeting dandruff with the dandruff shampoos; one is to eliminate the scale and one is to affect the underlying cause. somebody who has very thick scale and heavy dandruff you might need both products because until you get rid of some of the scale the active ingredient won't actually reach the skin to have the proper effect. so the first products to get rid of some of this scale would be something like salicylic acid that helps loosen the scale and eliminate it from the skin. the zinc pyrithione and the selenium sulphide target the underlying yeast or fungus that can cause the dandruff to begin with. so you might need both products and you can either use them one after the other or alternate one shampoo one and the next shampoo the other. afterwards you can still use your own shampoo if you prefer. so it's a lot of shampooing but for some people who really prefer their own shampoo or don't like the way these products smell you can still use your own shampoo after and you can certainly condition afterwards as well.	how do dandruff shampoos get rid of dandruff? what's the difference between selenium sulphide and zinc pyrithione?
there r two types of herpes. there r the oral kind and then there is genital kind. yes u can get herpes on your genitals from a cold sore. but even tho it is herpes on your genitals it is not actually the genital type of herpes. it is the oral type actually. u can spread each type to each area. yes her giving u head with a what looks like mainly healed sore can give u herpes. i have kissed a chick with a sore before to and didn't get nothing. some times your just lucky or perhaps your immune system is working harder and better at times i don't know. but u can get on acyclovir twice a day from your doctor it's herpes meds. or if u don't have insurance there is a natural pill for it u can get at health stores or what have u called l-lysine and take it twice a day and have her take it as well. hell even once a day would b good.	can a cold sore give me genital herpes? . recently my girlfriend gave me a blowjob. she had a cold sore on her lower lip. although the sore was completely scabbed over and is almost completely healed. she got it two weeks ago and has been using some type of medicine to get it healed. the bj lasted 15 seconds and the scab barely touched my penis. the sore isn't open at all so is there still a high risk of infection? whenever we make-out when she has a cold sore i never get one. and she generally gets them when she's really stressed.

the only true method to determine who may be the father is by having a paternity test. but if your friends remembers when she had sexual relations with these two men it is possible to make a pretty accurate determination of paternity within a 10 day period. for example if the baby were to be born on october 18 2014 (case #1) then the probable range of conception would have been january 21 2014- january 29 2014 if the baby was born on october 1 2014 (case #2) then the probable range of conception would be january 4- january - january 12 2014. in case # 1 if sex occurred on january 23rd with man # 2 and on january 12th with man # 1 then man # 2 is the likely father. in case # 2 if sex occurred on january 6th with man # 1 and on january 18th with man # 2 then man # 1 would be the likely father. the doctor who confirmed your friend's pregnancy can provide an expected due date and also provide the probable date range for conception. there are also computer programs available on the internet which can also make the determination. all that is needed is the expected due date and the dates on which sex occurred with the two men.	friend is pregnant but she doesn't know if it's her friend or her fiance baby. my friend is currently pregnant and she doesn't know if the baby is her friends or fiance and shes upset and she wants to know before the baby is born and is there a way she can find out because her fiance doesn't know please help on what to do and what to tell my friend

"i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds uncomfortable and unsettling. keep pursuing this situation with your physician. sometimes swelling of the lower limbs is caused by simple things like too much salt consumption or having a job that requires you to be on your feet all day (like a nurse for example. ) but other times swollen legs and feet can be a symptom of something more serious like congestive heart failure. because you state you feel fatigued you are considered ""symptomatic. "" in other words you're not just experiencing swollen feet with no other complaints (""asymptomatic""). and any time a patient has at least one sign (swelling) plus symptoms fatigue) it deserves to be investigated. if possible go back to your doctor as soon as you can. if nothing else call your doctor's nurse and explain how you're feeling. they will give you guidance on what to do. wishing you well!"	my legs and feet have been swollen for a week or so and i am very fatigued. can you tell me why. i recently had blood work done and brought up this problem to my dr. but it seems to be getting worse as the days go on. especially the swelling of my lower legs ankles and feet
constipation is a common problem that pregnant women have. and there are some things that they can do to help ease the constipation. the first thing is to probably change their diet. i am sure it's not something that a pregnant mom wants to hear because they want to have certain foods but by increasing your fibre intake having more fruit juices fresh fruit more water. water is a great substance that can actually help you ease your constipation. a lot of times pregnant moms are dehydrated because of the fact that they are not drinking enough during the day. so by making these little changes it will help. some minimal exercise. walking around a little bit more actually does a lot of great in helping constipation. there are stool softeners that are available. the common product is docusate sodium and that can be used by pregnant women but i would definitely recommend as a pharmacist that a pregnant woman check with their ob/gyn or healthcare provider first before starting that type of therapy.	how can i deal with constipation during pregnancy?

these bacteria are spread through direct contact with mucus from the nose or throat of persons who are infected or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. ill persons such as those who have strep throat or skin infections are most likely to spread the infection. persons who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. treating an infected person with an antibiotic for 24 hours or longer generally eliminates their ability to spread the bacteria. however it is important to complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. it is not likely that household items like plates cups or toys spread these bacteria.	how are group a streptococcal bacteria spread?
firstly let me tell you that sonography is not always suggestive of adenomyosis. it cannot diagnose it. for diagnosis you have to send biopsy of the uterus. in adenomyosis there is pain before during and after menses. there is also focal and diffuse type of adenomyosis. whatever you read on the internet is about diffuse or generalized adenomyosis. a few things on focal adenomyosis are available because most of the time it goes undiagnosed or has very mild symptoms that do not hamper routine. so just focus on the present and start trying for pregnancy. in fact if you get pregnant and pregnancy goes up to term or near term then there is a chance of cure from adenomyosis theoretically. if you do not have the symptoms of clear adenomyosis then there is a chance that it is not adenomyosis. so do not worry and take chance for a year. if you do not get pregnant then consult a gynecologist as normal people. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --><link>	Hello doctor,I am 29 years old. Last year, I was diagnosed with adenomyosis after an ultrasound. Previously, I had undergone ovarian polyp removal. My gynecologist has told me that there is no problem with me to get pregnant. However, everything I read online says differently. We plan to start trying for baby by next month. Is there anything I can do to help with the process? I am just confused with my doctor's words, as we have waited a year and the disease has more likely spread. I have been taking progesterone since the diagnosis. I just want to prepare myself mentally before trying. Thank you.

"there are no ""legal requirements"". the doctor sets his own rules and parameters when it comes to refills of chronic medications. many clinicians will let you go a year; others six months. while it can be a hassle and added expense to see your medical provider they are responsible for your care. having you come in is a good opportunity to give you a check-up see about your health maintenence that you may be ignoring (blood tests cancer screenings etc. ). make the appointment and discuss this directly with the doctor. not the office manager. ask for a one-year prescription of all of your meds if he is willing."	how often does a doctor legally have to see a patient to continue refilling a prescription on a noncontrolled substance? . i am regularly prescribed a medication for a stable chronic condition. i take it daily. it is not a pain medication or anything that could be abused. for a long time my prescriptions just automatically refilled but now my doctor's office manager is insisting that my prescription refill cannot be authorized because it's illegal to refill a prescription without having seen the patient for a period of time. is this the law or is she lying to make me spend money? .

although flaxseed makes a great addition to a healthy diet i am not aware of a specific amount that has been found to decrease the symptoms you mention. it's best to see a dietitian who specializes in gastrointestinal (gi) issues or a doctor. for more on potential causes gi distress see this webmd article. that being said to get flaxseed into your breakfast you can add spoonfuls to cereal like oatmeal baked goods (like pancakes and muffins) and to smoothies. it really doesn't have a taste (a bit nutty) and it's a great way to get more omega-3 fatty acids and fiber.	how should you add organic ground flaxseed to your diet? . one week my question is how to add organic ground flaxseed to my breakfast to. reduce:. bloating. gas. bowel movement smears
many people are unfortunately in the same boat as you. it's incredibly frustrating but the government is having difficulty with the exchanges and it's keeping many people from completing their application process. the good news is that you have until december 15th to buy coverage that starts at the first of the year (no plans can start before 1/1/14 anyhow). i would suggest you sit tight for a week or so to give the government time to work out the kinks and then try again.	i tried signing on to the health insurance marketplace site since it opened and cannot get on. what should i do?

the main dietary restriction for someone taking coumadin is paying attention to the vitamin k intake. most people can eat normally but be sure to not suddenly eat a lot more or a lot less of foods that are high in vitamin k than usual. vitamin k helps blood to clot so wounds do not bleed too much and sudden changes in vitamin k could keep coumadin from working well. here is a list of foods that are medium-high to high in vitamin k leafy green vegetables such as kale cabbage spinach turnip greens collard greens swiss chard mustard greens seaweed beet greens lettuce and endive canola and soybean oils brussels sprouts cauliflower broccoli asparagus liver (beef chicken or pork) parsley for more information read this article.	are there dietary restrictions when on coumadin? if so can you be precise what they are.

quebec and picky eaters — what do these things have in common? not a lot except they were both part of my weekend. i flew to quebec city on thursday for a pair of speaking engagements over the weekend. my afternoons were spent at a quaint country restaurant that overlooked the st. lawrence river. i spoke on what i’m passionate about: great food healthy eating and ways to bring more of that into your family’s life. a common theme amongst the crowd was what to do with the picky eaters in their families. sometimes i feel like we are misusing the word “picky. ” it almost gives the impression that the eater is carefully selecting and discerning about their ingredients. i don’t consider an adult or a child who will only eat pizza hot dogs and chicken nuggets “picky. ” i consider them really deprived and terrible eaters. it’s time to stand up and place the challenge back on the parents with the question “what are you willing to do? ” if i were to tell you that it is time to break your kids out of the salty processed-food habit could you stick to it? will you be willing to have a few nights of introducing new healthy food that they may initially reject? it helps if you start them truly hungry — so no giant glass of juice or milk with dinner. it also helps if you throw in some education. explain the benefits of fresh vegetables and lean proteins for muscle development brain development healthy skin better eyes etc. it will be natural for children to reject new foods a few times — this is all part of developing their taste buds. just make sure they actually taste the new food. it’s not too late. you can undo the current epidemic of unhealthy eating amongst children teens and ourselves and you can start in your own home tonight. please hear me i am not anti-pizza nor an advocate for a deprived diet-food lifestyle. i am however on a soapbox for us to get back in the kitchen and start cooking more. if you feel like your kid is only eating pizza for 12 out of 21 meals in the week a good transition is to help them make an after-school “pizza” on a sprouted grain english muffin with organic tomato sauce and a non-processed cheese like a low-fat mozzarella and a sprinkle of fresh herbs. have them help to make it and if you don’t already have potted herbs or fresh herbs in your garden i encourage you to start now and have your children pick some for the family meals. watch as the “picky” eaters in your family start picking up foods that will make them thrive instead of deprive them of vital nutrients and health. i know it can feel overwhelming and like a losing battle at times but don’t give up. your insistence dedication and willingness to choose good foods for yourself and your family will pay off with less meltdowns health issues and a sense of accomplishment for investing in yourselves.	how can i stop my child from being a picky eater?
i'm sorry you're going through this and hope you have sought medical treatment. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose a condition like this without a physical exam. many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe. a medical professional needs to see this and possibly run some additional tests in order to figure out what's going on. meanwhile be extremely careful not to touch surfaces or other people while the rash on your hands is active. wear light gloves if possible to keep from spreading whatever this may be to others. i hope you get a diagnosis and feel better soon!	itchy palms and fingers bilaterally_turned to multiple tender blisters over past 12 hr_now tender blisters back of neck

yes the virus that causes the common wart can spread fromt he fingers to the lips or even the inside of the nose (guess how this may have happened). the tape is a good idea but why not just treat the wart? a few seconds of freezing it with liquid nitrogen may do it or it could take a few treatments (depending on the location the size of the wart and your daughter's cooperation - this can sting). there are other slower but less-painful methods as well. if you treat the wart on the finger then the chance of it spreading is very unlikely.	can a child spread warts from their fingers to their mouth? . my daughter has a wart on her finger that she sucks on and i am afraid it will spread to her mouth. we are scared to put treatment on it because she sucks on her fingers. so we put medical tape around her finger which is what her dr. recommended.

"heart failure is caused by many conditions that damage the heart muscle including: coronary artery disease: cad a disease of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart causes decreased blood flow to the heart muscle. if the arteries become blocked the heart becomes starved for oxygen and nutrients. this condition along with heart attack is responsible for two thirds of heart failure cases in the u. s. heart attack: a heart attack may occur when a coronary artery becomes suddenly blocked stopping the flow of blood to the heart muscle and damaging it. all or part of the heart muscle becomes cut off from its supply of oxygen. a heart attack can damage the heart muscle resulting in a scarred area that does not function properly. ""non-ischemic"" cardiomyopathy: this condition occurs when there is damage to the heart muscle from causes other than artery or blood flow problems such as from infections or alcohol or drug abuse. conditions that overwork the heart: high blood pressure (hypertension) valve disease thyroid disease kidney disease diabetes or heart defects present at birth can all cause heart failure (some of these are non-ischemic cardiomyopathy -- see above). in addition heart failure can occur when several diseases or conditions are present at once."	what causes heart failure?

some viruses tend to adapt and mutate (change) and the influenza virus changes all of the time. medical science has a full time job keeping up with this primitive adaptation. bacteria can change too. this is why we have drug-resistant strains of staph (mrsa). yes you have to get a different flu vaccine every year depending on the strains that are circulating. people who had pertussis (whooping cough) as a child are not always immune for life -- the recent epidemic proves this. be glad that we have scientists keeping track of these things!	i read that people get flu shots annually because flu strains change. do strains of other diseases change?

"there is no convincing evidence that any herbal remedy will help people lose and maintain weight loss. here is the run down on the most promising ones. i highly recommend you spend some time figuring out why you carry excess weight and then focus on that. some people eat because they have dieted for years and feel deprived. others may eat because of stress or due to uncomfortable feelings. other simply eat very large portions and don't know when to stop which may be because they were raised to ""clean their plates"" and this habit continued. once you get a good handle on what is causing your weight you can then work on getting the help you need to deal with it. that might be seeing a therapist and registered dietitian (go to eatright. org to find one in your area). if you have significant health problems due to your weight you might even benefit from weight loss surgery or a medically supervised diet. for more tips on finding the right program for you see this article. most people can lose weight but it's keeping it off that is the hardest. if you work on the reasons you are overweight and not just the symptom of the weight itself you will be more likely to succeed. good luck! if you want to reduce your weight in herbal manner then honey will be the good solution for it. honey contains 22 amino acids and a variety of minerals essential for its metabolism and hence is helpful in preventing obesity. dissolve half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder in a cup of boiling water. stir the mixture and cover for half an hour. filter away any big particles and add a teaspoon of honey. take it in the morning with an empty stomach about half an hour before breakfast. this is the best home remedy for weight loss. one of the most effective herbal remedy i know is the apple cider vinegar. it contains a certain fiber which is known as the pectin which helps in flushing away fats and toxins. dr schweiger - <link> green tea."	which is the most effective herbal remedy for weight loss? . i am suffering from obesity and feeling uncomfortable and also demoralized because of your extra pounds
many of the largest studies to show no benefit for breast self-exam (bse) were done in countries outside the u. s.

there are a number of circumstances under which you're entitled to appeal your insurer's decisions. you can appeal if your insurer: denied payment for your care ruled that your care was not medically necessary said that you're not eligible for the benefit in question claimed that your treatment is experimental claimed that you have a pre-existing condition (when your plan does not cover them) by law your insurer must review your appeal and make a determination within certain timelines: 72 hours for denials of urgent care. 30 days for denials of nonurgent care you have not yet received. 60 days for denials of service you have already received. if your insurance company has been paying for your care and made a recent decision to stop it's always worth asking that it continue paying for your treatment until a determination on your appeal has been made.	when am i entitled to appeal my insurance company over a denial of care?

based on a set of criteria a hga1c level between 5. 7 and 6. 4% is prediabetes. this means that there is an increased risk for developing diabetes. essentially prediabetes describes a group of people with blood sugar levels between normal and the level used to diagnose someone with overt diabetes. it's important to discuss this with your health care provider since this category carries an increased risk of both diabetes and heart disease. most people in this category are overweight and have developed resistance to the actions of insulin. to help reduce your risk of developing overt diabetes and to reduce your risk of heart disease requires simple actions: routine exercise and weight management through reduce calories and nutritional knowledge. muscles are the primary site of action for insulin so get moving find an activity you enjoy and commit to a change in your priorities and lifestyle. these actions help utilize sugars burn fat and improve insulin's function. all of which reduce your risks of both diseases.	my a1c was 5. 9 should my dr have talked about prediabetes with me?

yes i'm sure there is a rational explanation for this. the problem is you won't get that explanation unless you see a medical professional for a physical exam. before i jumped to a conclusion of multiple sclerosis (ms) i'd think in terms of less-scary explanations like a problem with a disc in your neck. that might account for the arm weakness. muscle twitching can be caused by several things including a mild potassium deficiency. is the toe twitching related to the arm weakness? maybe. maybe not. your primary health care provider is in the best position to start putting all the pieces of this puzzle together because he or she knows your medical history current medications and supplements and so on. i'd suggest you call and make an appointment to get the ball rolling toward a diagnosis. meanwhile i wouldn't get too worried about this being something scary like ms. we'll both hope it's something easily explained and easily treated. wishing you all the best!	is toe twitching numbness in hand and weak arms a sign of ms? . my three toes beside my big toe on my left foot twitch at random times and it only lasts a couple of minutes but no matter what i do i cant stop it this happens a few times a month. also my right hand goes numb at least 4 or 5 times a day. i've noticed the past month or so that my arms are becomming so extremely weak i can barely change my 2 year old's clothes anymore becaue my arms get so weak and my muscles in my arms hurt. there is probably a rational explination for all of these symptoms right?

yes i am a facial cosmetic surgeon and still make patients happy with eyelid and facelifts neck lifts and chemical wrinkle removal. but for those on a tighter budget cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists can now give you some real bang for your non-surgical bucks. here is my shortlist of the three best things you can do for that healthy younger and youthful look: 1. retin-a. retin-a a derivative of vitamin a should be thought of as a vitamin too. the skin’s own potent and unique vitamin if you will. take “one a day” if you will. a nighttime application of just a pea-sized amount of retin-a (available also as the generic retinoic acid) followed by application of a moisturizer (another favorite and winner; see below) will go a long way to make your skin smoother and free of minor blemishes including some of those nasty brown spots age spots. an important long-term benefit of retin-a is that it thickens the outer layer of the skin and that’s important; thicker skin resists wrinkling. retin-a is available only by prescription. it comes in various strengths. consult your dermatologist or cosmetic plastic surgeon for more information and advice on use. and remember for the optimal results use it every day; don’t quit! 2. moisturizer + sunscreen. summer’s here -- we need to get serious about sun protection. particularly if you live in southern ca south texas or south florida. in those hot spots the sun is strong and therefore not your skin’s best friend. there are many excellent moisturizer-sunscreen combinations on the market. and don’t equate cost with excellence. the pricier ones have the big ticket to pay for all the marketing and advertising. what spf (sun protection factor) number should you use? the number scale was developed to indicate potency relative to elapsed time of use. divide the spf number by four to get the number of hours the product is expected to be effective. the only problem with such a general formula is that it does not take into account how heavy the application and what factors might cause the protection to be dissipated such as by sweating or water sports. best advice: pick a mid-strength product say spf 30; reapply every 2-3 hours and you cannot go wrong. remember a little sun is ok; nature intended us to get some sun to produce the essential vitamin d. but benefits diminish and negatives begin to appear after even just 20 minutes during the summer so be conservative with your sunbathing. 3. botox cosmetic or dysport. [everyone] has heard about or has used botox. dysport is its new competition; practitioners vary in their preference but don’t worry you cannot go wrong with either. botox has long-proven its safety and value. for the vertical frown lines between the eyebrows those horizontal forehead lines and the squint or crow’s feet just aside the eyes the injections are terrific. they can also be used to gently lift droopy eyebrows. yes they are not permanent but i see that as a plus. if you don’t like the results or don’t feel the injections –- several times a year –- are worth the cost you can drop out of the program with no negatives. if you like the results and think the cost is worth it you can continue. stay tuned. i suspect medical science which never sleeps will soon be delivering longer-lasting successors to botox and dysport.	what are some cheaper alternatives to plastic surgery for youthful skin?

this is a good question but it should be made clear that regulations around supplemental medicare plans known as medigap have nothering to do with the health reform law. medigap plans can be difficult to change over time because when you purhcase one outside of a certain timeframe medigap plans can take the state of your health into consideration when deciding whether or not to sell you a plan and for how much. so you can certainly inquire about changing plans and you should but understand the challenges you may face. i suggest you talk with a medicare counselor for personalized assistance with this matter. contact your state health insurance assistance programs (ship). to find the ship near you visit the medicare helpful contacts page on medicare. gov or call (800)medicare or 800-633-4227.	i am disabled due to a lung transplant. i am 62 years old. i am on social security medicare insurance (a&b) have my part d through humana and i have a supplemental policy through american family. how hard will it be for me to change my supplemental insurance to a different company and when can i change?

symptomatic treatment may occur while the underlying illness is being investigated because ideally nausea and vomiting should resolve when the cause of the symptoms resolves. nausea and vomiting are often made worse when the patient is dehydrated resulting in a vicious cycle. the nausea makes it difficult to drink fluid making the dehydration worse which then increases the nausea. intravenous fluids may be provided to correct this issue. there are a variety of antinausea medications (antiemetics) that may be prescribed. they can be administered in different ways depending upon the patient's ability to take them. medications are available by pill liquid or tablets that dissolve on or under the tongue by intravenous or intramuscular injection or by rectal suppository. common medications used to control nausea and vomiting include promethazine (phenergan) prochlorperazine (compazine) droperidol (inapsine) metoclopramide (reglan) and ondansetron (zofran). the decision as to which medication to use will depend on the specific situation.	how is nausea or vomiting treated?

the swelling that you have seems to be an abscess or pus due to infection. this infection is most likely due to your tooth decay over a long period of time which has spread to bone and around your soft tissues like muscles. in the face region swelling increases rapidly in size due to multiple natural pathways that connect each other. it is a potentially dangerous situation. the abscess needs to be drained quickly. if allowed to progress then it may lead to infection spreading to brain or even may lead to breathing difficulty. i suggest you antibiotic augmentin 625 mg twice daily along with analgesics. contact an oral surgeon or a dentist as soon as possible for physical evaluation and take the medicine with consent. follow up and get the tooth treated once infection subsides. do warm salt water rinses and apply ice to the swelling. do not apply heat as it will spread the infection further. the probable causes:tooth infection or abscess spread to vital spaces in the face. probable diagnosis:space infection due to tooth decay. treatment plan:1. abscess drainage. 2. antibiotics. 3. analgesics. 4. serratiopeptidase or other proteolytic enzymes. regarding follow up:for further information consult a dentist online. ---> <link>	Hi doctor,I had toothache for the past 48 hours. It made the right side of my face to completely swell. The toothache has now gone, but the swelling is increasing and started affecting the eye area.

it would not be prudent or even possible to determine if someone was experiencing a stroke blindly over the internet. strokes are unilateral (one sided) and severe daily foot or leg cramping are not signs one would experience. these symptoms could indicate vascular problems or even neurological disorders however so they deserve a complete evaluation by your medical provider. expect some diagnostic tests; including blood tests and perhaps a low back x-ray or doppler imaging studies of your lower extremities if your medical provider feels these tests are necessary. never underestimate the wisdom of your bodies to give us warning signs so please do not ignore these symptoms.	i get severe cramping in my hands and feet almost daily i am a african-american male 67 years old is this a stroke? . does daily severe foot and leg cramping indicate strokes? i am 67 yrs. old and african american?
tylenol and boniva are safe to take together or at different intervals throughout the day. however there are a few medications you should not take or should alter the time you take the doses while taking boniva. aspirin/nsaids can easily without one knowing damage the gastrointestinal (gi) tract causing irritation and possible bleeding. boniva is also very irritating to the gi system. therefore to reduce the irritation to the gi the medications should not be used adjunctively. remember there are over-the-counter nsaids as well as prescription nsaids. if an nsaid medication is required for another indication than fever timing is important. spread out the dose of boniva from the nsaid. remember to take boniva on an empty stomach and the nsaid with food even if you do not feel stomach irritation. work with your pharmacist and/or health care provider about timing and evaluating whether both medications should be maintenance therapy. boniva has a drug interaction with calcium supplements and antacids. these products can decrease the absorption of boniva decreasing the effects of the medication. it is not that you cannot take these products but rather about the timing. take boniva 60 minutes on an empty stomach prior to taking any calcium supplements and antacids.	i have a 100. 4 degree fever and i am planning to take boniva tomorrow. can i take tylenol to reduce fever with boniva?

"i'm sorry you're dealing with all of this. it sounds miserable! while nothing's impossible it's highly doubtful the steroid treatment caused the symptoms that developed in january. even though you've been thoroughly checked out if the symptoms persist you should consider continuing to follow up on them. many disease processes develop slowly over time. this means an initial workup (all those tests you had done) won't always reveal an answer. if you get tested later something may show up. i want to add also that i wouldn't jump to a conclusion of cancer or pre-cancer. nothing in your description would lead me to think ""cancer.

maybe you could start with smaller bouts of exercise instead of 50 minutes. start walking for 5 minutes per day and as you feel stronger increase to 10 and so on. make sure you eat something about 30 minutes before exercising like a banana yogurt or granola bar. if you are low on glycogen (stores of carbohydrates in muscle) it could increase your tiredness after exercise. if you continue to feel tired without a good reason visit your healthcare provider for a full blood work-up. certain nutrient deficiencies like anemia can also make you tired.	why do i get so tired after exercising? . i haven't gone out and done physical activity for about a month so i just went out for a nice and easy power walk for about 50 minutes. i come home and suddenly i just feel sluggish and exhausted. i don't starve myself. i eat when i'm hungry and when i need to eat. i get super tired and when i come home i just knock out. because i get so tired i don't like to exercise when i have school. it's been affecting my health and my body. i really want to exercise daily. help please <negative_smiley>
home pregnancy tests are very accurate so it's unlikely that you were pregnant before especially if you were at least 7 to 10 days late for your period. chapped lips aren't a common pregnancy symptom but it sounds like you had this issue before. given the recurring problem with your period and the other symptoms you're having i would not assume this is pregnancy. it's worth a visit to your doctor to find out what's going on. there's no harm in taking another pregnancy test but if it's negative call your doctor so you can find out what's going on.	my period had been late 3 months in a row. i have been constipated and i nearly fainted. could i be pregnant? . my lips have also become very chapped and they did in my first pregnancy too. i have taken a couple pregnancy test the first 2 months my period was late and they were negative but i havent taken on in over a month.
the surgical correction of a buried penis depends on the abnormality. however marked improvement can be achieved in almost all patients. the correction is based on re-establishing the connection of the erectile chambers of the penis to the penile skin along with the removal of excess pubic fat and/or skin. in severe cases of buried penis in which the patient has inadequate penis skin resulting from an overly aggressive circumcision or chronic inflammation then the penis must be freed and covered with a skin graft. the surgery is usually performed as an outpatient unless a skin graft is needed. the improvement in penile and pubic appearance can be dramatic. equally impressive is the patient’s positive personality and self-esteem improvement leading to more self-confidence and social interaction.	can surgery correct hidden or buried penis?

crohn's disease causes inflammation in the small intestine. crohn's disease usually occurs in the lower part of the small intestine called the ileum but it can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus. the inflammation extends deep into the lining of the affected organ. the inflammation can cause pain and can make the intestines empty frequently resulting in diarrhea. crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) the general name for diseases that cause inflammation in the intestines. crohn's disease can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other intestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and to another type of ibd called ulcerative colitis. ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and ulcers in the top layer of the lining of the large intestine. crohn's disease affects men and women equally and seems to run in some families. about 20 percent of people with crohn's disease have a blood relative with some form of ibd most often a brother or sister and sometimes a parent or child. crohn's disease may also be called ileitis or enteritis.	what is crohn's disease?

i'm glad you brought up a urinary tract infection (uti) because that is the first thing that jumped into my mind. it's possible for utis to occur again and again. for that reason alone it would be worth taking your father back to his primary health care provider for an exam. this will also give you an opportunity to discuss your other concerns with a medical professional. not eating can be a sign of some underlying condition that requires treatment (or hospice care depending on your father's wishes). it's not unusual for elderly people to gradually lose their sense of balance or to experience degenerative spinal problems that lead to weakness in the legs arms etc. regardless of the cause of your father's balance problems he may need to consider using an assistive device such as a walker on days when his balance isn't so good. wishing you all the best!	my elderly father will go from walking perfectly one day to not being able to walk the next. what's the problem? . normally my dad is able to walk and do normal things. but it can change in a single day and he is unable to walk and doesn't eat. when this first happened he had a uti. he took antibiotics and was fine within a day. but now it's happening more.

seventy percent of teens diagnosed when they are younger continue to have symptoms of their adhd that affect their functioning as adolescents. once your son stops taking his medication (concerta) his symptoms will return relatively quickly. unless he has learned other compensatory techniques or has outside help his symptoms will affect both his academic performance in school and his relationships with others. if he is driving he may have more difficulty focusing and with distractibility. teens with untreated adhd tend to have more car accidents and get more speeding tickets. all of this should be explained to him and i would suggest that he go in for a visit to discuss this and his decision to stop his medication with his health care provider. i often use this situation as an opportunity for the teen to learn more about how his adhd affects him and why or whether he need to continue his medication to treat his symptoms.	my 17-year-old has stopped taking concerta after 10 years. what affect will this have on his adhd?

what you're describing sounds like typical positioning for the laparascopic oopherectomy. as a former surgical nurse i helped position plenty of patients as you describe. i can't think of any reason why this positioning would aggravate your cervical spine or cause back spasms because the downward gravitational force on the spine while in the lithotomy position with trendelenburg (with the feet elevated 15-30 degrees) is lower than the force on the spine when walking for example. certainly if your surgeon anesthesiologist or circulating rn thought the positioning would aggravate your spine issues they would not have done it. in the operating room we take positioning extremely seriously are very careful regarding these issues. so sorry to hear you're dealing with the back issues and hope you can get yourself fixed up soon!	is trendleburg position advisible for abdominal surgery on patients with cervical herniated discs. i recently had laprascopic surgery for ovary removal i have previously had an acdf on c5 /c6 but reinjured and discs are symptomatic i also have t6 t7 large protrusions when i woke from surgery i was in spasm and 7 weeks later am still in a lot of pain - i think it was due to the position i was in during surgery; i was put into lithotomy position withmy upper body in trendleburg position. is this advisible for someone with my spinal injuries?

the discovery and use of antibiotics for bacterial infections is considered one of the most important breakthroughs in medical history. unfortunately bacteria are extremely adaptable and the overuse of antibiotics has made many of them resistant to medical treatment. this has created serious problems especially in hospital settings. antibiotics are ineffective against viruses -- including those which cause most upper-respiratory tract infections -- and many leading organizations now recommend against the routine use of antibiotics unless there is clear evidence of a bacterial infection. since the beginning of the 20th century vaccines have effectively reduced the incidence of viral diseases such as polio measles and chickenpox. in addition vaccines can prevent such infections such as the flu hepatitis a hepatitis b human papillomavirus (hpv) and others. but the treatment of viral infections has proved more challenging primarily because viruses are relatively tiny and reproduce inside cells. for some viral diseases -- such as herpes simplex virus infections hiv/aids and influenza -- antiviral medications have become available. however the use of antiviral medications has been associated with the development of drug-resistant microbes.	how are bacterial and viral infections treated?

it is important to keep your remaining teeth healthy and strong as the success of the bridge (depending on the type selected) depends on the solid foundation offered by the surrounding teeth. brushing twice a day and flossing daily helps prevent tooth decay and gum disease that can lead to tooth loss. your dentist or dental hygienist can demonstrate how to properly brush and floss your teeth. keeping a regular cleaning schedule will help diagnose problems at an early stage when treatment has a better prognosis. selecting a balanced diet for proper nutrition is also important.	how do i care for my dental bridge?

assuming you're not allergic to ibuprofen the answer is yes. by all means take some for the pain of strep throat. ugh! ibuprofen doesn't interact with antibiotics so it's ok to take everything at the same time (if you also were given oral antibiotics). if you are an adult you should not take more than 2400mg of ibuprofen in a 24-hour period. you can divide that up in different ways but you should never take more than 800mg of ibuprofen at a time. children's dosing for ibuprofen is significantly different from adult dosing. if you weigh less than 95 pounds you should consult a pharmacist for directions on how to take ibuprofen. wishing you well! yes you can 2 ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed	i was given an antibiotic shot for strep throat. can i also take ibuprofen? . i was given the shot at 8:30 this morning. i forgot to ask if i could take ibuprofen for the pain.

one of the questions or at least problems that some people tell me dr. breus i take a nap and i feel worse when i get up than i did when i fell asleep. well that means that you’ve napped too long because then you’ve gone into deep sleep and you’re going to have a real hard time pulling yourself out of that deep sleep. now is it just because you woke up in the middle of that deep sleep? generally speaking if you wake up in the middle of that deep sleep it’s really hard to shake that sleepy feeling and that’s when you don’t feel so good. what can you do if that does happen to you? truthfully there’s not a whole lot. you could have some caffeine which would help bring you out of it. caffeine by the way i don’t have a problem with caffeine i don’t have a problem with people drinking coffee i just want them to do it responsibly and know and understand the effects of caffeine. so if you wake up from a nap and you feel worse than you did before having some caffeine will probably help. the biggest thing that’s going to help though is walking outside and getting sunlight. sunlight is it directly affects your body’s ability to produce melatonin. because remember you don’t produce melatonin in the light. so if you wake up and you don’t feel so hot before you go and grab that soda or coffee i’d say walk outside and get a little bit of sunlight and even walk around a little bit and you should be able shake yourself out of it pretty quick.	what can i do if naps make me groggy?
yes you do. hormone replacement therapy such as using estrogen for the symptoms of menopause must be done under the supervision of a medical provider. if you're experiencing the symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes (flushes) vaginal dryness and sleeplessness then i'd suggest you speak to your gynecologist or primary care provider can assess whether or not you're a candidate for hormone replacement therapy. keep in mind taking estrogen carries risks such as blood clots and strokes. you and your health care provider need to discuss the pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy in your unique situation. best wishes to you!	do i have to get a prescription from my doctor to get conjugated estrogens premarin

current home pregnancy tests (hpts) are advertised to be sensitive on the first day of a missed period—or perhaps a few days before. in the most recent review of accuracy of hpts published in august of 2011 such claims were tested. one brand first response® detected 97% of pregnancies on the first day of a missed period. the ept® manual (54%) and digital (67%); and the clear blue® manual (64%) and digital (54%) tests all detected fewer actual pregnancies. these results may reflect that the first response® could detect as little as 5. 5 miu/ml of hcg in the urine while the other two brands could detect 22 miu/ml. generally speaking a reliable pregnancy test in a doctor’s office should be able to detect a level of 22 units of hcg or higher. remember it takes an implantation to produce hcg to trigger a test. in a study where day of implantation was documented with a sensitive blood test it was determined that 10% of viable pregnancies were not yet implanted by the first day of the missed period! having read all this you can now understand why a gyn may recommend using a hpt twice if the first instance is at the time of missed flow. about 97% of viable pregnancies will have implanted by seven days after the first day of missed menses. taking a second reading can also enhance accuracy where your hpt is not one of the super-sensitive brands.	had sex on fertile days when should i check if pregnant?

if you have symptoms of hypothyroidism your doctor will order blood tests to check hormone levels. these may include: thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) t4 (thyroxine) lower-than-normal t4 levels usually mean you have hypothyroidism. however some people may have increased tsh levels while having normal t4 levels. this is called subclinical (mild) hypothyroidism. it is believed to be an early stage of hypothyroidism. if your test results or physical exam of the thyroid are abnormal your doctor may order a thyroid ultrasound or thyroid scan to check for nodules or inflammation.	how is hypothyroidism diagnosed?

lice are very easily spread usually through close personal contact. lice infestation may be caused by any of the three types of lice: head lice may be spread through close personal contact shared personal items (combs brushes hats helmets clothing or earphones) or shared bedding. pubic lice are spread mainly through sexual contact and are very contagious. most people become infected after a single exposure to an infected person. but the lice and eggs may survive long enough on personal items such as clothing or towels to be spread to another person. a child diagnosed with pubic lice may have a history of sexual abuse. body lice are most often spread by contact with personal items especially clothing and hats. they are occasionally spread by direct personal contact. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes lice?

tattoo removal has come a very long way and we have advances in our lasers to help remove tattoos of all different colors. typically the longer the tattoo and if it's a simple black tattoo those are the easiest to remove. once you get into the red and the yellow and the green colors it's a little bit more complicate and sometimes we can't entirely remove it and certainly not without leaving a mark behind. so the risk is that it takes multiple treatments. sometimes 10-20 treatments. the treatments can be painful and it can get costly and there's still a risk of having a scar left behind. so if you really don't hate the tattoo i would recommend trying to learn to love it but if you really do want to have it removed i would find a dermatologist that specializes in tattoo removal. you can do this by going to the american academy of dermatology website or the american society of dermatologic surgery website and look for doctors that specialize in those treatments.	i have a tattoo that i want to get removed by laser. how do choose a reputable place and how many treatments do i need?

when children turn one it is recommended they switch from formula to whole milk or continue breastfeeding. children up to two still need more fat than older kids so unless directed by your doctor keep them on whole milk. it is recommended that children over two get no more than 24 ounces of milk per day (3 cups) to prevent iron deficiency anemia. too much milk can crowd out other nutritious foods in the diet so avoid allowing your child to sip on milk (or juice) and instead serve as part of meals and snacks and before bed. between 2-3 cups a day of whole milk for a one year old is fine.	1 yr old should drink how much 2% milk a day? . send answer to fred. strawder@msn. com

"it's impossible to answer your question because the answer is different for every single substance. what you're really asking is ""how long does it take the body to metabolize (break down and eliminate) various legal and illegal drugs""? the prescribing information for legal medications includes the drug's ""half-life. "" the half-life is the length of time it takes the body to metabolize half the active ingredient. thus if the half-life of a drug is 12 hours it means half of the active ingredient will still be circulating in your blood 12 hours after you take the medication. that gives you some idea of how long it takes the body to metabolize that particular drug. however we're not talking about a perfectly curved graph when it comes to drug metabolism. you should not assume if a drug has a 12-hour half life that all of it will be eliminated from your system in 24 hours. it might be. or maybe it will all be eliminated at the 18 hour mark. pharmacokinetics is a precise science. in terms of illegal drugs think of it this way: if you take no illegal drugs they will stay in your system for exactly zero hours for drug testing purposes. in other words if you avoid taking illegal drugs you need not worry about drug testing. anyway you shouldn't be taking illegal drugs. (i'm excluding marijuana from this category simply because some states have now legalized it. my exclusion of marijuana does not imply i endorse or approve of using it. ) there are a whole host of problems that go along with taking illegal drugs -- one of which is you don't really know what you're taking. there's no safe ""dosing"" level. they interact very badly with prescription medications. the list goes on. best bet: if you know you're going to be subjected to random or routine drug tests make sure you have a valid prescription for any medication that might turn up positive and avoid taking illegal drugs. wishing you well!"	how long do various legal and illegal drugs stay in your system for drug testing purposes?

i don’t know any doctors who prescribe sex to treat diabetes but after hearing a recent lecture i’m starting to wonder “why not? ” there’s a general notion that sex is favorable to good health but most doctors don’t specifically encourage their patients to have more sex. naturally we don’t want to encourage unprotected or unsafe sex associated with sexually transmitted diseases or sex that leads to unwanted pregnancies. also we don’t want to encourage reckless sex that leads to car accidents or dislocated hips or other unforeseen injuries and the last thing we want is for someone to have a heart attack during sex and blame us for it. however i can’t think of a single patient i treat who is likely to have any of those “bad outcomes” from having more sex. having a heart attack during sex is very rare and in fact increased sexual frequency is associated with reduced risk of heart disease and is encouraged after recovering from a heart attack. sex is one form of exercise that most people like! it’s good for the heart and circulation and helps maintain good blood flow to the sex organs. “use it or lose it” is a fair statement particularly in older people and those with diabetes. erectile dysfunction occurs in over half of men with diabetes especially after several years of poor blood sugar control and maintaining sexual frequency may potentially help delay or avoid erectile dysfunction. not surprisingly eating right and exercising can help partially reverse erectile dysfunction in men by improving blood pressure blood flow body fat and hormone levels. women with diabetes may also be at increased risk for sexual problems and it stands to reason that maintaining an active sex life may help prevent such problems. healthy sleep habits are very important for diabetes management – and sex and sleep are closely related (enough to be considered “bedfellows” perhaps). sex improves sleep and vice versa. similarly problems with sleep can interfere with sex. sex releases hormones that help promote sleep (especially in men) and sleep promotes hormones that favor good blood sugar control and appetite control. by the same token inadequate sleep quality or quantity promotes hormones that worsen blood sugar control appetite weight gain diabetes and heart disease. so here we have a cycle of gradually decreasing health sleep and sex over time. as one aspect worsens the others may too on and on it goes. the shame of it is that people generally like sex and sleep and feeling good. can we break the cycle? is it as simple as turning off the tv an hour earlier and having more sex? unfortunately it’s not always so simple. doctors are in a great position to help patients recognize and reverse this cycle and should embrace the power of healthy sexuality to fight chronic illness but most are not doing so. it is not because doctors are unaware of the health benefits of sex. it is not that doctors are afraid of the remote negative outcomes mentioned above. doctors don’t bring up sex because it’s so easy not to and because patients don’t typically bring it up on their own. this mirrors the reasons doctors and patients often don’t bring up obesity and weight loss during the course of a routine health visit. because visits are often rushed the problem is not acute there are lots of other priorities and starting the discussion seems risky. i know we can do much better. im 45 years old and i'm diabetes patient. i cannot make love due to my penis not strong. what can i do and how to overcome thisproblem the keys to a man's sustained sexual health are proper diet exercise and the use of a penis health creme every morning. in my opinion man1 man oil is the best creme available as it is packed with penis-specific vitamins nutrients proteins and antioxidants. it will keep things strong clean and functional down there. hope this info helps!	how are sex and sleep related to diabetes?
"bipolar disorder typically develops during the adolescent years. one of the signs of bipolar disorder is a condition known as ""hypomania"". during this phase there is a sudden rush of unusual energy the patient often perceives as productivity. left untreated however hypomania can progress to severe mania and in some people is followed by depression. a true manic episode is diagnosed if elevated mood occurs with three or more of the symptoms most of the day nearly every day for at least one week. if irritability is present then four or more symptoms are required for diagnosis. a depressive episode is said to exist if five or more symptoms exist for most of the day every day for two weeks or more. a psychiatrist is usually the type of physician who makes the determination of bipolar disorder. frequently blood and urine tests are done to rule out drug use as the cause of symptoms or certain illnesses such as thyroid disorder."	how is bipolar disorder diagnosed?

i really do not have enough information to answer that question specifically for you. if you are a virgin and have never had sex then yes it would be normal to be scared for many reasons. you may have a fear of an unintended pregnancy an std or just afraid of the sexual act itself since you have never experienced it before. if you are new to a relationship and are being pressured to have sex remember that you are in charge. you do not have to have sex until you are ready. i don't know if you are a male or female but if you have ever been sexually-molested in the past the idea of having sexual intimacy could be frightening. if you have been sexually involved in the past without problems and are now having issues it may take a few visits to a counselor to uncover any hidden reasons for your fears.	is it normal to be scared to have sex?
simply eating a balanced healthy diet will support your body in building white blood cells. there are no specific foods you can eat that will speed up the process. making white blood cells requires a supply of nutrients including amino acids and purines. beans peas spinach and lean protein (like chicken and fish) are rich in these nutrients. however even relatively poor diets provide adequate material to make a normal white blood cell count unless something else is wrong. a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) is not due to inadequate nutrition except possibly in cases of extreme starvation. people with leukopenia have either a high rate of destruction of white blood cells or the body is limited in making them for some other reason. eating a healthy diet won’t build white blood cells faster but does have many other health benefits.	how can i build white blood cells with food?
hi if any medicines dont work on you then exercises yoga and meditation seem best for you. avoid taking anti epileptic tablets without a pin point diagnosis. gastritis is also known to cause headaches and taking antacids daily may well help you reduce the symptoms. thanks	15 year old always gets headaches, no one and nothing helps?
there is really no way for a medical professional to blindly determine a healing time based solely with the information you provided in your posting. healing time is very individual -- especially when you have osteopenia. healing time depends on your age the severity of the infection the degree of displacement and a dozen other variables. sometimes there is a non-union. a fracture that will not fuse without some help and unfortunately this help is often surgically. stabilizing a fracture with a pin may be recommended but the good news is that the fibula is not a weight bearing bone so the orthopedist may recommend waiting longer. perhaps a month more to see if nature takes care of it.	how long does it take a displaced fracture of the fibula to heal? . i broke my fibula about 6 weeks ago: it is displaced broke in 3 places at the tip. the swelling has almost gone down and it seems like it is healing. last time i got x-rays {2 weeks ago} it was still displaced. i have osteopenia and take 1000 mg of calcium a day. don't want surgery do you think it will heal without? if so how long?

its important to keep in mind that you can't make someone change their habits if they don't want to. however you can give them alternatives. first what does you son like to do? work from there to find some activities he might be interested in. if he enjoys video games what about utilizing wii technology to start some family games of tennis or bowling. click on the link below to learn more: <link> second look into non-traditional varieties of exercise. i had a friend whose daughter wasn't very active then fell in love with horses. she then spent a great deal of her time either riding or caring for (grooming cleaning stalls etc) now is this exercise yes but not like we normally think of it. she didn't measure her heart rate or look to see how long she had been in the barn. it was a way for her to get moving that she loved that involved lots of hard manual labor. now she's healthy as a horse. i know bad pun but i couldn't help myself. finally look into some activities you could do as a family. is there an indoor climbing facility in your town? it's a great form of exercise and really exciting to boot. what about laser tag paintball or geo-caching? geo-caching is described as outdoor treasure hunting. using gps coordinates you locate caches left behind by other enthusiasts or even companies. its fun and generally involves lots of walking. for some additional information about geocaching and other activities click on the links below <link> <link> i might suggest getting him a dog. let him pick it out. it can be his friend and he should be responsible for the care. he will then be required to care for the dog by walking it 3 times a day! if he doesn't have a pet or you can't have a pet suggest to him walking dogs for money from friends or neighbors for money. i would also suggest you walk daily as a family! get all the junk food out of the house. find an interest that he has and try to incorporate health and walking into it. hope this helps good luck!	what is the way of reducing weight for 18 years old boy if he doesnt want to exercise at all? . my boy is 18 years old he is 130 kg weight and doesnt have any mood for exercises i tried a lot of things to encourage him reduce weight. please advice on what to do and if there is any medications that is safe and can help him. we live in canada. thanks
first off you want to check for signs of dehydration including fewer wet diapers less play sunken eyes sunken fontanelle (soft spot on baby's head) loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. the fact that your baby isn't eating enough for adequate growth is another consideration. six months is also the time to start solids which is important for development and nutrition. this webmd article discusses various causes of diarrhea in babies. i would contact your doctor to find out if he or she wants you to come back in or get referred to a gastroenterologist. i think your gut is saying something isn't right -- and that is very important in my book. there may be a chance that your baby is intolerant to lactose. i would take her to the doctor and demand action. for the moment you could feed your baby cooled boiled water to ensure that she is receiving enough fluid the body can cope better without food than it can without fluid. i hope you find this useful and i hope your baby feels better soon.	my 6mth old weighs only 12. 8 lbs and has had diarrhea for 3 weeks what tests could be done to help determine the cause. after the first week i took her to the doctor and they diagnosed her with ear infections. she started augmentin a week later i took her back because she was still having diarrhea and loss of apetite and fevers ranging from 99. 0 - 102. 7 rectally. her wbc was 9. 5 and they said it was probably a virus. now another week has passed and she isn't better. no fevers that i have noticed but she is having watery bowel movements about 6 times a day and is only eating about 16 oz of formula a day.
scarlet fever is caused by strep. it would not be likely that this person would still be contagious months later unless of course they are a strep carrier. people can get exposed to strep quite easily by other people or from objects that area contaminated by strep. the only way you will know for sure if you have strep is to be tested.	if someone i know had scarlet fever months ago could they still be carrying the bacteria and be infectious? . while my tonsils are not very swollen the pockets that they sit in are. i've never seen that before and i always look when i have a sore throat. i was in contact 5 days ago with a child that had been diagnosed with scarlet fever a few months back and he did not come to school again on friday. i'm just wondering if i'm on the right path with what i might have.

cadillac insurance plans aren't really a concern for those buying coverage on their own. rather they refer to high-cost plans generally offered by employers. starting in 2018 employers and insurers offering health plans that cost more than $10 200 for an individual and $27 500 for a family will pay a 40% exise tax on any amount over those dollar thresholds.

"another ridiculous claim. all supplements including food are absorbed in the intestines. the stomach is only part of digestion. there are some pharmaceuticals that are designed to withstand the highly-acidic stomach environment by special coats or being encapsulated but i would have no idea if this company that claims to be giving you ""live stem cells"" in a capsule has this technology. stem cells -- especially those from animal sources -- are never administered orally."	is there such thing as supplement that only digest in intestine only? . in a talk i went to the presenter told me that the supplement which is a live stemcell (purtier riway) is specially made so that it will only start to break out and being absorb by the body in the intestine which through the technologies use to encapsule the live stem cell would prevent it from being dissolve by the stomach acid and later being release in the intestine so that the unharmed live stem cell to be absorb by the body and not kill by the stomach acid.

hopefully when you take zantac or pepcid over-the-counter type of h2 blockers you should feel some relief within 30 minutes to an hour. so once again if you don't feel like it's helping then you could also take possibly an antacid like a maalox or tums or mylanta that would be okay. but if you find that that's still not helping in some cases you may need to be referred to a physician or a healthcare provider to have it looked at further. you can try one and of course the antacid may have a quicker effect because of the fact that its a liquid. so it doesn't take as long to dissolve as compared to the tablet.	how long after i take zantac will i begin to feel relief?

"certain illnesses almost always result in an application for health insurance on the private market being declined. these include cancer heart disease diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and drug and alcohol dependency. other minor conditions such as allergies asthma mild depression or well-controlled high blood pressure or migraines may result in a denial from some insurance companies but not others. cobra because you've had coverage through your employer you would likely qualify for cobra continuation coverage which will extend your current health plan for 18 months. once you've exhausted your cobra benefits you're guaranteed by federal law to get a policy on the private insurance market. just make sure you obtain a certificate of ""credible coverage"" from your current insurance company once your cobra benefits end. pcip pre-existing condition insurance plans (pcip) were set up under health reform to extend coverage for the medically uninsurable. the plans are intended to function as a bridge until 2014 when insurers can no longer deny coverage even to those who are sick. the requirements for pcip plan eligibility make it difficult for many people to access -- you must be without health insurance coverage for at least six months. you can check out the various pcip plans available along with costs here. private insurance although insurance companies selling plans on the private market can and often do decline coverage based on minor ailments or past treatments you shouldn't just assume you'll be denied if you have a medical condition. the key is to shop around to different carriers. it's also a good idea to work with a licensed insurance agent knowledgeable about the carriers in your state. you can check the national association of health underwriters' website to find someone near you."	how do i find insurance that will cover pre-existing conditions after losing employer health coverage?

usually rebound headaches are treated by a neurologist and its better to find one that treats a lot of headaches. almost any of the prevention medications can help with rebound headaches but i usually start with one of the medications that has an fda indication for migraine prevention (inderol depakote or topamax). as these gradually start working you will take less excedrin and end up off the medication. sometimes changing what you take for a headache helps also such as changing to a prescription version of naproxen or using one of the triptans like imitrex or relpax. there are more aggressive treatments for rebound headaches that involve admission to the hospital and iv medications but i usually don't start off with that as the first treatment.	can you recommend a medication for rebound headaches besides excedrin?

if you are breastfeeding or giving your baby infant formula a cautious approach would be to protect your baby from exposure to the flu virus in the following ways: ask for help from someone who is not sick to feed and care for your baby if possible. if there is no one else who can take care of your baby while you are sick try to wear a face mask at all times when you are feeding or caring for your baby. you should also be very careful about washing your hands and taking everyday precautions to prevent your baby from getting flu. using a cloth blanket between you and your baby during feedings might also help. if you are breastfeeding someone who is not sick can give your baby your expressed milk. ideally babies less than about 6 months of age should get their feedings from breast milk. it is ok to take medicines to treat the flu while you are breastfeeding.	is it ok to for me to breastfeed my baby if i am sick with the flu?
leg pains are very common in fm including referred pain nerve pain restless leg syndrome and muscle spasm pain. other causes of leg pain can include disc problems pinched nerves peripheral neuropathy vascular disease joint disease etc. [could p]rior work injuries could be involved? please have your doctor look over any new or persistent pain problems. antidepressents are known to help fm pain in many people. there's been an accumulating body of medical evidence demonstrating how different antidepressant meds: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (like effexor) and tricyclic antidepressants can help decrease fm pain. it's common for patients not to first realize how much a med may be helping until they go off of it. they may understate or underappreciate the med's pain-relieving benefit while on it but realize it must have been working because the pain level escalates once off the med. discuss with your doctor possible additional medicine strategies. i was on effexor for quite a while and found it very effective. however when i started to have problems with muscles and aches. not knowing that i was probably dealing with fibromyalgia. i switched to cymbalta. i have found it to be helpful with the aches. your pain sounds like you may be having problems with your sciatica. a nerve that runs from your lower back down through your butt. and then down the leg. it can be very painful. i have had spinal injections that have been helpful and for a brief time participated in a pain management program. sometimes it is hard to figure what comes first the chronic pain or the depression. i will say that effective pain management does allow me to focus more on dealing with the depression. talk with your doctor about developing a plan that can try to address both issues. best wishes to you.	i have fibromyalgia with severe leg pain radiating from the hip area to my toes. can antidepressants help? . i was taking effexor for depression and that helped but i went off because of side effects.
i assume that you have been prescribed a brace since you are recovering from a fusion procedure. if so it is unlikley that any type of chair would be very harmful for you as long as you are wearing your brace. some types of furniture that may be helpful to avoid are: ones where your knees have to bend a lot more than 90 degrees for you to get your bottom down to the seat; ones where the cushions are extremely soft causing you to sink down into them; ones that do not have arms that are available to help you get out of the chair; and ones that have a[n] odd angle betwee[n] the seat and the back. recliners in and of themselves are not inappropriate as long as you enter and exit the recliner with the seat in the upright position and you do not recline excessively. it really is primarily an issue of comfort and unfortunately 5 days out from a fusion procedure it is hard to be comfortable in any chair. a lot of that has to do with the surgical pain and dissection of the muscles. this will improve exponentially with time	what type of chair would be most comfortable as i recover from back fusion surgery?

while some research studies have supported the use of stents in the left main coronary artery - it is still not common practice in the united states particularly in young otherwise healthy individuals who would be expected to have a very good long term result from bypass surgery. my greatest concern with left main stenting is not the procedure itself but the increased likelihood that the patient would require additional angiograms/stents which could potentially increase overall long-term risk over many years when compared to surgery.	can a stent be used to open up a blockage in the left main artery?

whether you have to include social security disability as income depends on whether or not it is your sole source of income. if you have other income in addition to your disability benefits they may be taxed otherwise they generally won't be. a good answer is to see whether you included disability income as adjusted gross income when you filed your taxes last year.	i live in minnesota and will apply for insurance on mnsure. . i am unclear if i need to include social security disability as income. for 2014 i will receive only a monthly pension and social security disability as income. if i exclude the disability as income i qualify for medical assistance.

you have mentioned numbness in the inner part of the left foot as your main symptom. most commonly numbness is a manifestation of a nerve involvement it can be compression of the nerve at an anatomical site like in back or anywhere along the course of the nerve or it may be a manifestation of a systemic disease like diabetes or any condition that leads to what we call as neuropathy. now your trigger has been the yoga courses which you do on a regular basis every year but you have done may be for a prolonged period this year. being an orthopaedic surgeon i may not be able to guide you anything regarding yoga and its usefulness but it is logical to stop all these postures till your condition settles and improves. my guess is that there has been some prolonged compression during your classes or there could be an entrapment somewhere along the course of your nerve. i need to know from you: whether you have any back pain? is there any radiating pain from the spine region all along the course of your limb? apart from numbness are there any other symptoms of neurological involvement like weakness paresthesias burning sensations etc. also present? if the answers to above questions are no my suggestion to you will be to wait for a few days and start with medications for neuropathic symptoms like pregabalin or gabapentin along with vitamin b 12 supplementation and it is a good possibility that your symptoms may subside over next 4-6 weeks because there might be nerve neuropraxia (mid nerve injury). in case your symptoms do not improve or if they increase then i suggest you to get few blood tests done and nerve conduction studies to look for any compressive pathology. get back to an orthopaedician and traumatologist online for further queries --> <link>	Hello Doctor,I am a 39 year old male. My height is 6 feet and I weigh 81 kg. Right side of my left foot is having numbness though it is not 100% numb. The left side of the foot has little pain. I get a feeling that there is some blockage in the blood flow though it might not be the case.I am a regular vipassana meditator and I have been going to 10 day courses regularly for the past 6 years. This time I decided to do a 30 day course. This numbness started happening on the 10th day and continued for 20 more days. A typical vipassana requires sitting for 13-14 hours with small breaks at regular intervals. I thought I will get better once I start doing activity after coming back home (though I used to walk for 15-20 minutes daily during the course also). I never had such problem in the past courses. There was no improvement in the condition even after 15 days after coming back. I have done alternate hot and cold water treatment but did not see any improvement. I also tried doing massage using rheumatic oil.  In case it helps, my family has had cases of diabetics (my grandmother and my father's brothers). What would you recommend?
"any child. boy or girl. going through signs of early puberty will most likely need antiperspirant and a deodorant! it is not harmful and it will not change her maturation rate in any way. buy her some and encourage frequent showers and changes of clothes. when my grand-daughter was this age the teacher sent home a note suggesting deodorant-antiperspirants so it is better if this comes from you. as a matter of fact she was thrilled knowing that she was starting puberty. she didn't know that ""stink"" often is the hallmark sign."	are antiperspirants harmful for a 10 year old girl? i heard they lead to early puberty and are not good for kids.
that issue revolves around what medication one will get during the procedure and whether or not these medications would enter the milk and then be passed to the infant. each medication that is given in the operating room and post-operatively has a history of whether or not it would be likely to enter into the mother’s milk. but frankly science is never 100% and i am very cautious and conservative. i don’t believe in taking any chances with the new baby and therefore i would suggest that if a mother is breastfeeding that the surgery be put off until breastfeeding is complete. the alternative would be for the mother to just stop breastfeeding for some period of time and not resume it until we are quite certain that all the medications have cleared from the system which is typically a matter of some days.	is it safe to have cosmetic surgery while breastfeeding?

well each person is very different which means that each human body has different levels of tolerance. for example one person's body may be able to handle the 30% burns easier than others. the body could go into shock from any traumatic experience such as a burn or being exposed to mercury. the amount that the body can handle before going into shock is different for each person. you also have to take into consideration the health of the person. for example someone with healthy lungs usually has no complications recovering from bronchitis while someone with a condition such as asthma may have several complications because it is harder for the body to heal itself.	how can so little damage or so little of something cause mortality? . how can so little of something or so small a percentage of damage cause something as severe as mortality? for example dying from as little as 30% burns on your body (not from something more common sense -to me- like 50% or higher) or having 7% plaque blocking your arteries or even ingesting as little as 100 micrograms of mercury would kill you.

take these everyday steps to help prevent the spread of germs and protect your health and the health of your family: cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or sneeze into your sleeve. throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. wash your hands often with soap and warm water especially after you cough or sneeze. if soap and water are not available an alcohol-based hand rub can be used. avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth. germs spread this way. try to avoid close contact with sick people. pay attention to your body and how you are feeling. if you think you have the flu call your doctor or clinic right away. if you are pregnant and you live with or have close contact with someone who has the flu talk with your doctor about medicines to prevent flu. and have a plan for someone else to take care of a sick family member. stock up on household health and emergency supplies such as acetaminophen (acetamin panadol tylenol) water and non-perishable foods.	what everyday measures can i take to protect myself from the flu?

table salt is getting a lot of competition from the new guy on the block--- sea salt. the hype about sea salt is that they claim it contains trace minerals that table salt doesn't have. truth is those minerals are in such a low quantity that they don't make a difference to your health. the interesting news is that because sea salt has a much more intense flavor you end up using less of it. that's great for the prevention of high blood pressure and heart disease.	is sea salt better than table salt?

osteoarthritis (ah-stee-oh-ar-threye-tis) is the most common type of arthritis and is seen especially among older people. sometimes it is called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthrosis. osteoarthritis mostly affects cartilage (kar-til-uj) the hard but slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they meet to form a joint. healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another. it also absorbs energy from the shock of physical movement. in osteoarthritis the surface layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. this allows bones under the cartilage to rub together causing pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. over time the joint may lose its normal shape. also small deposits of bone – called osteophytes or bone spurs – may grow on the edges of the joint. bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space. this causes more pain and damage. people with osteoarthritis usually have joint pain and some movement limitations. unlike some other forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis affects only joint function and does not affect skin tissue the lungs the eyes or the blood vessels. in rheumatoid arthritis the second most common form of arthritis the immune system attacks the tissues of the joints leading to pain inflammation and eventually joint damage and malformation. it typically begins at a younger age than osteoarthritis causes swelling and redness in joints and may make people feel sick tired and uncommonly feverish.	what is osteoarthritis?
"polymerase chain reaction is a method to analyze a short sequence of dna (or rna) even in samples containing only minute quantities of dna or rna. pcr is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of dna or rna. previously amplification of dna involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria and took weeks. but now with pcr done in test tubes it takes only a few hours. pcr is highly efficient so that untold numbers of copies can be made of the dna. moreover pcr uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying dna: two ""primers"" short single-stranded dna sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the dna stretch to be copied. an enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of dna reading its code and assembling a copy. a pile of dna building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy."	what is polymerase chain reaction?

i don't believe that testosterone has anything to do with affection and intimacy. those emotions are between a man's ears than his legs. more than half of the people in this world do not have testosterone or extremely low levels. women and children for example. and they show plenty of affection need cuddling kissing and share lots of affection. if a man were surgically castrated for whatever reason this should not adversely affect his ability to show any of these important (and vital) human emotions. this issue is less likely to be biological and more likely to be psychological but it can be complex. while that may be difficult for a man to accept he often will need to be reminded that his biggest and most important sex organ is his brain. if he needs help a counselor can really help (if you can get by the stubbornness and get him (or you) to go).	can low t affect a man's ability to show affection (not sexually)? . showing a level of intimacy that does not lead to sex. for example touching cuddlying kissing a desire for giving and receiving affection.

a couple of years have gone by since the center for science in the public interest first filed a complaint against the parent company (coca-cola) that manufactures glaceau vitamin water. and now the washington-based national consumers league has joined in by filing a formal complaint with the federal trade commission calling advertising and labeling claims on vitamin water products “dangerously misleading. ” as if the “names” of the various vitamin water flavors like “revive ” “focus ” or “defense” weren’t misleading enough health claims made in advertising have ranged from “supporting optimal immune function” to “reducing the risk of age-related eye disease. ” hopefully we all know that fortifying sugar water with various vitamins and minerals isn’t really going to keep us from getting sick or reduce the risk of disease. the best thing we can do for most of these health concerns is to eat a healthful diet rich in whole foods and plant foods get plenty of rest and wash our hands frequently. for example vitamin water’s focus drink features “vitamin a and lutein ” according to the label on the bottle. if you want some lutein one of the antioxidant-acting carotenoid phytochemicals that has been mentioned in research lately just eat some dark green leafy veggies green peppers corn avocados oranges tomatoes or parsley! and instead of drinking their defense drink with vitamin c and zinc just eat an orange broccoli (and other dark leafy green veggies) brussels sprouts berries kiwi cantaloupe papaya or mango for the vitamin c and some lean meats crab nuts and whole grains for zinc. here’s what we do know about glaceau vitamin water: each 20-ounce bottle is labeled as containing 2. 5 servings crystalline fructose is the true main ingredient accounting for about 33 grams of sugar if you drink the whole bottle. each 20-ounce bottle totals 125 calories. the bottom line: keep your eyes open when it comes to manufactured products making health claims especially those fortified with nutrients. remember that the best water to drink is still good old h20 — not water pumped with 50 calories worth of sugar per eight-ounce serving.	what should i know about vitamin water?

as many times as you can become mentally aware of your behind and as you do contract your glutes. you can be standing in line walking up stairs or running to the bus. pay attention to how they feel as you move. in addition to strength training and good nutrition you need to be doing regular cardio (goal is to burn 400 calories each session) with intensity intervals. that means when you hit the hills by increasing your treadmill’s incline you’ll cook a ton of calories compared to simply walking on the flat. or ramp up the speed with which you walk. intensity intervals simply mean adding hills and/or speed every now and again to your workout. other butt blasters: backward leg toe touch and lift: stand behind a chair toes facing forward with both hands placed on top of the chair for stability. keeping both knees straight extend your left leg back pointing your toes with your big toe touching the ground behind you. gently lift your left leg about 30 degrees off the ground without bending your knee. tighten your glutes and hold for a count of 10. bring down and touch the ground with your pointed big toe and lift right back up for another count of 10. repeat this 5 times and switch sides. donkey kick crossover: grab a mat and get on all fours with your hands under your shoulders. keep your left knee and ankle flexed as you lift your knee to hip level behind you. hold for a count of 5 and bring down touching the mat briefly and lift again. repeat 5 times and switch sides. butt bridge: lie face up on a mat with knees bent and feet flat arms by your side. left hips slowly off the floor forming a straight line from knees to shoulders. tighten your glutes and maintain this bridge position for a count of 10. bring your butt down for 10 seconds and lift back up again into bridge position for a count of 10. see if you can do it for a count of 20. repeat 5 times. sizzling squat: stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. engage your core abdominal muscles. place your hands behind your head elbows out to the side. squat down never going beyond a 90 degree angle to your lower legs. for novices or anyone with knee issues just squat down enough to feel your glutes engage well and hold for a count of 3. as you stand up for an added twist rotate your trunk to the left and lift your bent left knee in front of you. return to squat again. switch sides and repeat. do this whole set 5 times. invisible chair wall squat: you can do this anytime and anywhere there’s a wall. standing straight place your back on a wall. squat down as previously described and imagine you’re sitting on an invisible chair. squeeze your glutes. hold for a count of 5-10 (or 20 for the advanced) and stand up. rest for 10 seconds and repeat 5 times.	what exercises will tone and and strengthen my glutes?

here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. no. 1: control your weight if you are at a healthy weight maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. if you are overweight losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. data from the first national health and nutrition examination survey a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of americans showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. the risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. being overweight strains the joints particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees hips and joints of the feet causing the cartilage to wear away. if you already have osteoarthritis losing weight may help improve symptoms. no. 2: exercise if the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. fortunately even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles the quadriceps can reduce the risk. if fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers which may make it easier for you to exercise and stay active. the safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints such as bicycling swimming and water exercise. light weight lifting exercises are another option but if you already have osteoarthritis first speak with your doctor. no. 3: avoid injuries or get them treated suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. people who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. to avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases recommends the following: avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. when jumping land with your knees bent. do warm-up exercises before sports even less vigorous ones such as golf. cool down after vigorous sports. wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. if you have a joint injury it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. no. 4: eat right although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. they include: omega-3 fatty acids. these healthy fats reduce joint inflammation while unhealthy fats can increase it. good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils including walnut canola soybean flaxseed/linseed and olive. vitamin c. one study of participants in the framingham study found that moderate intake of vitamin c (120-200 milligrams per day) reduced the risk of osteoarthritis progression threefold. you can get more vitamin c in your diet by eating green peppers citrus fruits and juices strawberries tomatoes broccoli turnip greens and other leafy greens sweet and white potatoes and cantaloupe. vitamin d. another study of framingham study participants showed that people who have knee osteoarthritis and low blood levels of vitamin d are three times more likely to experience disease progression compared to people with high levels of the vitamin. your body makes most of the vitamin d it needs in response to sunlight. you can get more vitamin d in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon mackerel tuna sardines and herring; vitamin d-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs.	what can i do to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression?

seizures -- abnormal movement or behavior due to unusual electrical activity in the brain -- are a symptom of epilepsy. epilepsy is a group of related disorders characterized by a tendency for recurrent seizures. non-epileptic seizures (called pseudoseizures) are not accompanied by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and may be caused by psychological issues or stress. provoked seizures are single seizures that may occur as the result of trauma low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) low blood sodium high fever or alcohol or drug abuse. fever-related (febrile) seizures may occur during infancy; children usually outgrow them by age 6. seizure disorder is a general term used to describe any condition in which seizures may be a symptom.	what is a seizure and what is epilepsy?
most helpful answer viral pharyngitis is just a sore throat caused by a cold (respiratory) virus. biologically respiratory viruses are contagious a day before you know you are sick and then for about two days later (estimate). exposing others would not likely cause them to have identical symptoms but they could get a cold. since cold viruses are everywhere she can really go back to her usual activities (school church choir) when she is feeling better. colds last about a week but most people feel fine by day four. resting the voice when she has a sore throat is usually a good idea so use your own judgment.	is my daughter's viral pharyngitis contagious? . asking this for my daughter. i don't want her to get anyone in our family sick. especially if my daughter has to go to school she is also in choir should i write a note to her teacher letting her know if she has to rest her voice? should i keep her home?

in the last 12 years soy has been believed to lower ldl-c [bad cholesterol]. however recent data has not shown soy to be a practical means to lower ldl-c. in order to achieve any meaningful ldl-c reduction large amounts of soy are required. even when individuals consume half their daily protein with soy protein only a very small reduction (3%) in ldl-c is achieved. soy seems to be a more efficacious lipid-lowering agent in persons with marked hyperlipidemia. it should be noted that reduction in lipids may be due to replacing high-fat animal protein with soy rich foods that may indirectly result in lipid reduction via a reduction in saturated fat intake.	can soy help lower cholesterol?
hi this could be down to the change over of bc pills if the hormones had changed it could all be from this as hormones can really upset our lives. but if your really worried do go see you doctor and get a pregnancy test done but wait for the week after your next missed period or light period women can have very light 3 day periods through there pregnancy's. hope this helps you. good luck	how to tell if you pregnant? . i have started talking a new generic birth control pill and the week before my sugar pill week and getting me period i had abnormal bleeding where it was clear bloody (like urine) not very think and bloody like if i were to miss pills and take them to catch up and spot. it lasted the spotting occasionally for a couple days especially during intercourse. the week of my period i did not get any of the pms symptoms i normally get. i bleed very little and when i lie on my belly it hurts a lot

i would definitely recommend seeing a doctor or a healthcare provider. one of the common causes of insomnia is pain and we all are realizing now that your level of pain is different than my level of pain and that could be the cause of it. the other thing is what pain pills are we taking? are they taking a lot of acetaminophen or tylenol? are they are also taking motrin or ibuprofen? what other sleep aids are they taking on top of that? do they realize that tylenol pm has tylenol in it on top of all these acetaminophen they are taking? so we want to make sure that the healthcare provider or doctor is aware of this situation. the pharmacist needs to be aware of this situation in case they are taking any prescription medications on top of it and their pain really needs to be assessed. even though they say it's doing okay there are some prescription medications or they may have to go to physical therapy; which should be better options for them and they may not have to rely on so many medications. they may also not be feeling well in general. the side effects from the medication the drowsiness or upset stomach could lead to bigger problems down the road. so i would highly encourage that person to definitely consider seeing at least a primary care physician for just an evaluation and to make sure everything is in check.	over-the-counter pain medications and sleeping pills are helping with my insomnia. should i still see a doctor?
no.	could mouthwash cause high blood pressure

a tax credit under the law translates to your health plan cost being reduced. people do have the option of paying the full price of insurance throughout the year and then taking the credit at tax time. but most people will choose to have the credit applied to their health plan so they pay less for it each month. if you don't make enough money to file taxes you will no doubt qualify for medicaid and hopefully you live in a state that has decided to expand its program. if you do you'll gain coverage at no cost to you. also if you don't make enough money to file taxes you won't be held responsible for getting coverage. so if you don't have insurance you won't be on the hook for the penalty.

medicines used to treat angina reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen to compensate for the reduced blood supply. three commonly used classes of drugs are the nitrates beta blockers and calcium blockers. nitroglycerin (nitro-bid) is an example of a nitrate. examples of beta blockers include propranolol (inderal) and atenolol (tenormin). examples of calcium blockers include nicardipine (cardene) and nifedipine (procardia adalat). unstable angina is also treated with aspirin and the intravenous blood thinner heparin. aspirin prevents clumping of platelets while heparin prevents blood clotting on the surface of plaques in a critically narrowed artery. when patients continue to have angina despite taking maximum medications or when significant ischemia still occurs with exercise testing they usually need coronary arteriography. during coronary arteriography doctors decide whether the patient should be considered for percutaneous coronary intervention or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (ptca) where a small balloon is used to inflate the blockage. angioplasty (ptca) is usually followed by placement of a stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (cabg) to increase coronary artery blood flow. angioplasty can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients. under x-ray guidance a wire is advanced from the groin to the coronary artery. a small catheter with a balloon at the end is threaded over the wire to reach the narrowed segment. the balloon is then inflated to push the artery open and a steel mesh stent is generally inserted. cabg surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients who have failed medical therapy and are not good candidates for angioplasty (ptca). cabg surgery is ideal for patients with many narrowings in multiple coronary artery branches such as is often seen in patients with diabetes. cabg surgery has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and in patients with significant narrowing of multiple arteries especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function.	how is coronary artery disease treated?

yes. most women who have an ectopic pregnancy have subsequent normal pregnancies and births. if a fallopian tube had to be removed you can still get pregnant since the remaining fallopian tube should function normally. discuss the timing of your next pregnancy with your health care provider. some health care providers recommend waiting a certain amount of time (from three to six months) before trying to conceive again. taking time to heal both physically and emotionally after an ectopic pregnancy is important. above all don't blame yourself. counseling is available to help you cope with your loss. pregnancy loss support groups may also be a valuable resource to you and your partner. ask your health care provider for more information about counseling and support groups.	can i get pregnant after i've had an ectopic pregnancy?

i can't offer you a definitive answer based solely on your brief description. i would need to see and exam this child but one possibility would be impetigo -- a staph or skin strep infection. there can certainly be many other causes. ten year olds like to swing on bars during recess and often get blisters. if they pick at those blisters on a dirty hand it can become secondarily infected and this infection can spread to the mouth quite easily.	my 10 year old got a hand blister and now she has scabs around her mouth. what could this be. the blister had skin coming out. the mouth stores just happens when she woke up from a nap

there is a condition called polymorphous light eruption; it’s a long name we just call it pmle. what happens is that usually when you have short burst of exposure after not being in the sun for a while you notice this rash with the sun and it can be very itchy and uncomfortable. this is a sensitivity to the sun. as you have continued exposure generally it wears off and then the next time you go on vacation or the next spring is when you will start to see it again. it's important to take antihistamines which you can get from your dermatologist or physician or over-the-counter. sometimes topical cortisones help calm it down but really avoidance of sun as much as possible is the best way to treat it.	when i am out in the sun i get a rash why?
my heart goes out to both you and your husband. multiple sclerosis is enough to deal with on its own without adding trigeminal neuralgia (tn) into the mix. for others who may not know what tn is it's an extremely painful condition usually caused by pressure on a nerve at the base of the skull. this nerve extends into the frontal portion of the face. when the nerve becomes irritated it may cause painful facial spasms. as you know the first-line treatment for tn usually involves taking the medication tegretol. however other medications are available to try either alone or in combination with tegretol if the medication doesn't work or stops working. i suggest your husband go back to his doctor for further advice on how to manage the pain of his tn. wishing you both well!	if tegretol doesnt work for trigeminal neuritis what next. husband has m. s. developed trigeminal now very bad. trying upped dose of baclofen. would steroid shots be the next step. tegretol did work wellbut didi have a fainting episode that he has had many times before trigeminal. dr took him off tegretol but hes desperate enogh to go back on with a half dose thanks

i don’t think that there is quite enough research yet to justify the claim that red peppers can treat hypertension. the simple answer is that there never is one “super food” that should be emphasized more than any other to treat any health condition. i would suggest looking into the dash diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). the dash diet emphasizes fruits vegetables fat-free or low-fat dairy products whole grain products fish poultry and nuts. it’s also lower in red meat sugars and sodium. this diet has been shown to lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people. a healthy eating plan such as the dash diet along with a consistent cardiovascular exercise routine can be part of an effective treatment and management plan for hypertension. consult with your doctor further and please visit the following website for more information: <link> hi yes your right google cayennepepper do it as one word it will take you to a site all about cayenne pepper look down the left hand side its all there. good luck	is red pepper a good supplement to treat hypertension. i have read that a ingrediant in red pepper is very good at treating hypertension

the main risk factor is heredity with the incidence rising from 1% in the general population to nearly 10% in those whose parents or siblings have the disorder. the twin of a person with schizophrenia has a 50% risk of developing it as well. women are at greater risk than men and both sexes are most prone during their teens and early 20s. schizophrenia rarely develops after age 45 or in young children though some as young as seven have been occasionally diagnosed.	what are the risk factors for schizophrenia?
"i'm going to say if your health care provider feels aspirin (asa) is sufficient for your blood thinning needs then i'd go with that assessment. your health care provider is in the best position to judge the situation because he or she knows your complete medical history. in general it's not unusual to step down from a ""big gun"" blood thinner like warfarin (coumadin) at some point after a person has experienced a pulmonary embolism (pe). this is because the pe likely has stabilized by now (that is you haven't had more symptoms that would indicate the pe has gotten larger) and now you only need an anticoagulant (blood thinner) to help prevent another clot. aspirin therapy works quite well for this purpose. hope this helps set your mind at ease!"	coumadin prescribed a year ago for pe. d/c d/t gi bleed. asa ordered. is this sufficient?

"well my friend it sounds like you are constipated. and on top of that probably have a hemorrhoid yes. that would account for any visible red blood on the stool or in the toilet water after you have a bowel movement. while i applaud your devotion to greek yogurt i agree it's probably wise to cut back from 8-12 containers per day. eating excessive amounts of dairy products can indeed cause constipation. if you manage your constipation you can avoid further trouble from hemorrhoids. first you need to make sure you're drinking plenty of water each day. second eat a fiber-rich diet that includes a sizable portion of minimally cooked plant foods. in the short term you can take an over-the-counter stool softener (not laxative) such as docusate sodium. please do not do anything radical like a bowel cleanse. it's not necessary and can disrupt the natural flora of your gut which are important for your immune system. just read up on constipation using the link above and you should find your problems resolving within a week or two. wishing you well! let me first start by saying i am not a doctor just your fellow webmd follower and i have had crohns disease for 12 years and know a little something about bowel movements. two important questions: my first question is: is the blood red or black? red blood means there is irritation either from a hemorrhoid or rectal bleeding which generally is not concerning. it either means you need to start drinking more water and/or taking stool softeners. you usually can tell if you need more water by bleeding and large hard stools. my next question would be: if the blood is black or the stool is tarry this is where you need to see a doctor. this means there is bleeding up high in the colon or intestine a colposcopy is highly recommended. i suspect what you are feeling is a large hemorrhoid when you feel inside. again i hate to say it but see a doctor and/or stick to extra water stool softeners and continue with you yogurt as this will ""balance"" you. i had this problem and it turned out to be a hemorrhoid. my doctor recommended benefiber which is taste free and it actually worked. <link>"	my bowel movement my stool is so hard it hurts at a 10 pain level. there is blood right after not much but a little. this happens every bowel movement i have had i stopped eating a lot of greek yogurt thinking that may help because it started when i started eating almost 8 to 12 containers a day. i feel like it is on the right side inside my anal cavity i have put my finger up there to check. it feels like something is there. what could this be i was thinking its bleeding because my bowel movents are so huge and hard and sometimes look like big like rocks what could this be other then a hemorrhoid?

"the groin like the armpits can be rich in sweat glands and very prone to an overgrowth of odor-causing bacteria. assuming you do not have a skin infection or fungal infection (these can smell) and the odor is truly not vaginal (you would need to see your gyn) this problem may be able to be controlled ""environmentally"". use cotton undies. always. sleep without them to allow extra air exposure at night. use a good soap. perhaps one that is more antibacterial. and actually use a mild deodorant/antiperspirant (you can use the same one as you use for your armpits). hi doc try reading this. what can i do practically about perineal odor? can i use deodorant sprays? it is best to try to control body odors by natural means rather than deodorant and antiperspirant cover ups because many women can get an irritant vulvitis from chemicals placed on the vulvar region. this does not happen with all women but does with some. its from this site. <link> but one thing i forgot was shaving shaving the pubic will help rid the area of the smell as hairs trap odours then this will build up during the day also going commando as often as you can apart from sleeping naked will also help. as they say all bits of info help. hi this may be the place your looking for its a blog with solutions have a good read through then go to solutions it may be just what you want. <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. i do hope this helps you. good luck"	what if you are a clean person and have a foul oniony smell in the pubic region all the time but not inside vagina?

let's start by noting that there are two types of herpes. herpes simplex 1 causes cold sores (blisters and cracking around the mouth). herpes simplex 2 is the sexually transmitted virus. luckily preventing the spread of either of these types of herpes is the same: avoid contact with others during an outbreak. if you have a cold sore do not kiss anyone. you also should avoid touching the cold sore. if you do touch it be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before you touch anything or anyone else. do not perform oral sex on your partner if you have a cold sore because this can cause your partner to develop genital herpes. if you have an outbreak of genital herpes it's extremely important not to have sex because this is how genital herpes spreads. use of a condom is not insurance against transmitting herpes because the condom may not cover all the infected skin areas. there is no cure for either type of herpes. oral herpes usually clears up on its own within a couple of weeks. your healthcare provider can advise you regarding treatments and vaccines for genital herpes.	how to you prevent the spread of herpes?

it's important to use an eye makeup remover that's specific for waterproof mascara. i am not a big fan of waterproof mascara for that very reason. i think it does coat the eyelashes a little too heavily and can be difficult to remove and sometimes the eyelashes can come out with it. fortunately the eyelash cycle is pretty quick so your hair will grow back very quickly over time really within a matter of a few weeks. but it's uncomfortable if you are using it over a long period of time to keep losing lashes like that. so i would try recommending a water-based mascara except for very special occasions when you really need something longer lasting. then if you have the waterproof mascara look for something that's very specific and take your time. let it sit on your lashes for a little bit longer and then rinse with lukewarm water and then repeat the process without rubbing because it's the rubbing that can physically remove the lashes.	i am losing eyelashes when i wear waterproof mascara. what can i use to clean my face that won't damage my eyelashes?
if you think your dog has poison ivy you should definitely wash your dog because if you are getting it from your dog then that's going to keep happening until you get that resin off the dog. the one thing is you can't spread it from yourself. so if you have poison ivy on your body and you scratch that's not how you spread it. it might be from under your nails or from your gardening toolkit or from your dog those can be sources of it but it's not from the rash itself. the way to treat it is really to see your dermatologist and get a strong cortisone cream or ointment or gel to put on it to help dry it up. when it's bad enough you may even have to take cortisone by mouth which isn't the ideal thing but sometimes when it's bad enough and it's uncomfortable that helps knock it out pretty well. it can start even two to three days after your exposure. so i have had patients come in and it's three or four days later and all of a sudden the rash starts to come out. so it doesn't always happen right away. the one thing is if you think your dog has poison ivy resin on its fur you have about ten minutes from your exposure to go wash it off. so if you have any suspicion; if he is out in the woods and he starts running around and he comes back and touches you and you know he was in an area where there was poison ivy try to get inside as quickly as possible. you can use soap to get that off your skin but after ten minutes it's in and you are going to have to deal with it. taking antihistamines also helps. so you can take that as well. something like benadryl or claritin or allegra all those types of antihistamines can help a lot. but sometimes when it's bad enough you just have to take prednisone by mouth for up to two weeks even before it starts to calm down.	i was walking my dog and may have gotten poison ivy. how do i get rid of the itching? do i have to bathe my dog?

symptoms of allergies and colds can be similar but here's how to tell the difference: occurrence of symptoms: both cause symptoms of sneezing congestion runny nose watery eyes fatigue and headaches. however colds often cause symptoms one at a time: first sneezing then a runny nose and then congestion. allergies cause symptoms that occur all at once. duration of symptoms: cold symptoms generally last from 7 to 10 days. allergy symptoms continue as long as a person is exposed to the allergy-causing agent but may subside soon after elimination of allergen exposure. mucus discharge: colds may cause yellowish nasal discharge suggesting an infectious cause. allergies generally cause clear thin watery mucus discharge. sneezing: sneezing especially two or three times in a row is a more common allergy symptom. time of year: colds are more common during the winter. allergies are more common in the spring through the fall when plants pollinate. presence of a fever: colds may be accompanied by a fever but allergies are not usually associated with a fever.	how can i tell if my child has allergies or a common cold?

deciding to exercise while you’re sick can depend a lot on your illness and your symptoms. to be honest the answer to your question often depends on who you’re asking since there really doesn’t seem to be a clear consensus or agreement. i personally feel more often than not that it’s best to take time to rest and recover from your illness before continuing with exercise. my rationale comes from a physiological standpoint. basically exercise can put a lot of stress on your body and your immune system is the only way that your body fights infections and pathogens that make you sick. when you exercise you’re devoting some of your body’s resources towards recovery from exercise instead of recovery from illness. in some instances exercise may even make you sicker or even prolong your illness. you also have to consider how comfortable you would feel while exercising with some of your various symptoms. medication may help alleviate some symptoms but otherwise how would you feel trying to go for a run if you’re congested or have a persistent cough? if you choose to exercise while sick you should consider decreasing your exercise intensity frequency or duration until you fully recover. please be considerate by following proper gym etiquette if you choose to work out in a gym. check out this webmd article for more input and guidance: <link>. i have the same symptoms. i feel its closer to the bronchitis side of things because of the clear mucus i cough when i am not riding. i am able to comfortably take my heart rate over 160 but i still have a cough which lasts for weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection (generally also involving the sinuses. i also get the odd drainage from my sinuses after/during a hot shower for example which seems to clear them. my explanation is as follows: when i am riding outdoors in the summer i breath a lot of pollens (i am not in the city) a little exhaust and this will tend to exacerbate an existing irritation. corticosteroids have limited effect to reduce the irritation but can reduce an acute irritation to the point where it is no longer chronic and my body's defenses can make a difference. thus its a combination of factors which typically plays out in the following order 1. bad cold/urt infection (5 days) 2. chronic cough (1 week to 8 weeks) but lungs good enough to exercise. 3. clear 2-8 months managing the level 2 is what this is all about. on occasions where i have been at the coast swimming in the sea often clears things up much faster. (which supports the sinus/allergen/irritant theory).	should i continue exercise if i have a cold or bronchitis? . i developed sinus pressure and chest congestion. i continued my running. when my symptoms didn't improve after 3 weeks i went to a doctor who gave me a steroid and an antibiotic but said it was okay to keep running. i recovered mostly though i still felt the symptoms a little. last night i developed a dry cough which feels again to be in my chest and i have a little sinus pressure again. my exercise helps me mentally but is it the cause of my prolonged problem?
due to the fact that my dr had me on 10/650 hydrocodone/acetaminophen 8 x day for a few years my liver test were extreamly high. he even called me personally and asked if i was alive (not funny at the time). he switched me to 10mg oxycodone and no acetaminophen what-so-ever. ibuprofen is all i'm allowed. though my case may be rare i don't recommend acetaminophen to be taken daily ever. be sure you know the warning signs as i was vomiting alot and very tired all the time for no reason.	is there a risk of liver damage if i take acetaminophen with my prescription pain medicine (oxycodone)? . i have suffered for many years with low back pain. in the past two years i have had to start taking prescription pain relievers. currently i am taking roxycodone 15mg on as needed basis. my dr. said i could take over the counter pain relievers with the roxys if i was still experiencing pain. i know there is a risk of liver damage more so with one than the other acetaminophen or ibuprofen so which is the best for me to take with my prescription pain meds? thank you.
i suspect you have seen those television ads that promise compensation for male gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) due to an association with respirdal. i see this common problem in pubescent many times per month and none of them are taking respirdal. granted i only have a few patients on this drug and none of the boys have breast tissue. if there is a link as the lawyer group claims i sure have not seen it. i would seriously doubt that your son would have this problem surface seven years after taking this drug for only thirty days. he should see his medical provider nonetheless to be properly examined.	respridal. my son took respridal in 2007 for less than 30 days. he has an enhanced chest area. should his chest area gone back down after stopping the meds or is it a prolonged side effect of the medication? thank you.

a cause of a bloody ear discharge cannot be determined without a hands-on medical examination. it is very important for you to see your medical provider.	why do i have bloody drainage from my ear? . i had a brain tumor a few years back and had surgery to remove it. they went in through the ear. i normally have a yellow discharge from it. today it was blood. what could be the cause?
no. an itchy ear is likely to be a problem in the external ear canal not a healing eardrum. however the drainage from the rupture could have caused some inflammation resulting in some itching. keep things out of your ears especially q-tips. if you are a q-tip user removing the protective earwax can make you ears more prone to infections and yes. itching. until your eardrum is totally healed it is not a good idea to get water in it either.	is an itchy ear a sign of my eardrum healing? . i was diagnosed with a ear infection and given amoxicillin to treat it. the nexy day my eardrum ruptured and a clear yet somewhat bloody fluid drained from my ear. my ear has been a little itchy and it gives me these twitches every once in a while. by the way i'm 15.

"shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus the virus that also causes chickenpox. in a person who has been exposed to chickenpox -- or its vaccine -- the virus never really goes away. it can lie dormant in the body's nerves. in most cases it stays that way. but in some -- especially people with immune systems weakened by disease or treatment -- the virus can reappear. this is likely to happen years or decades after the person had chickenpox. when it comes back the virus can cause shingles: a rash that often appears as a band on one side of the body. early shingles symptoms can include: headache light sensitivity flu-like symptoms without fever. itching tingling or extreme pain where the rash is developing may come next and the pain can be moderate to severe. are you contagious? though people who haven't had chickenpox can catch that condition from you the shingles itself isn't contagious. for reasons that experts don't really understand the pain of shingles lingers for some. if the pain lasts for at least four months after the shingles rash appeared a person is diagnosed with phn. in some people the pain will subside. in others it won't. ""we don't have any idea why the pain goes away in some people and not others "" says robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y. but the longer you have phn -- especially after a year -- the less likely it is to resolve he says."	what are shingles and postherpetic neuralgia?

i'm neither a guy nor a urologist but one thing i feel pretty confident saying is this: circumcised or not masturbation shouldn't hurt (or sting uncomfortably). of course the penis always swells when it's aroused. the swelling causes the penis to stay erect for penetration during sexual intercourse. if that's the type of swelling you're talking about then it's perfectly normal. if you're implying you experience an abnormal swelling other than a normal erection then that's worth investigating. i suggest you see a urologist to explain what's going on and find out if what you're experiencing is normal or is something that needs to be addressed. do not feel embarrassed consulting a urologist. they deal with questions like yours every day and will respond in a respectful and dignified way. you have a legitimate concern after all. take care! you need to use a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it is made just for guys who masturbate and both treats and prevents a number of skin issues down there. like soreness chafing dryness discoloration and even a loss of sensitivity. it is the best overall penis skin care product available. you can get it online. hope things get better.	18 year old guy uncircumcised virgin. my problem is that my penis gets swollen when i masturbate well the outer skin. i'm 18 uncircumcised and still a virgin. as i masturbate i could feel a mild sting on the skin and the outer skin of my penis gradually swells. and this happens every time. i don't masturbate too frequently and i don't do too rough so i don't understand why it would do that. and the swelling lasts a couple hours after i ejaculate. is this normal is there someone i can/should do?

brain tumors can be benign or malignant : benign brain tumors do not contain cancer cells. usually benign tumors can be removed and they seldom grow back. the border or edge of a benign brain tumor can be clearly seen. cells from benign tumors do not invade tissues around them or spread to other parts of the body. however benign tumors can press on sensitive areas of the brain and cause serious health problems. unlike benign tumors in most other parts of the body benign brain tumors are sometimes life threatening. very rarely a benign brain tumor may become malignant. malignant brain tumors contain cancer cells. malignant brain tumors are generally more serious and often are life threatening. they are likely to grow rapidly and crowd or invade the surrounding healthy brain tissue. very rarely cancer cells may break away from a malignant brain tumor and spread to other parts of the brain to the spinal cord or even to other parts of the body. the spread of cancer is called metastasis. sometimes a malignant tumor does not extend into healthy tissue. the tumor may be contained within a layer of tissue. or the bones of the skull or another structure in the head may confine it. this kind of tumor is called encapsulated. tumor grade doctors sometimes group brain tumors by grade - from low grade (grade i) to high grade (grade iv). the grade of a tumor refers to the way the cells look under a microscope. cells from high-grade tumors look more abnormal and generally grow faster than cells from low-grade tumors.	what are benign and malignant brain tumors?

regular physical activity protects against crc. we can reduce our risk by as much as 24% if we just get up and get moving. aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also protect against crc. statins (medication that lowers cholesterol) may affect crc in a positive way. postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was shown in the women’s health initiative study to reduce the incidence of crc. dietary calcium magnesium fish oils and vitamin b6 all have positive effects in reducing crc. and non-herbal tea and possibly coffee a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red and processed meats may all be protective against crc. antioxidants folic acid and a diet high in fiber have not been shown to aid in preventing cancer of the colon and rectum. but the following have been shown to increase our risk: obesity alcohol cigarette smoking diabetes and being insulin resistant. drinking more than 45 grams per day of alcohol increases a person’s life risk for colorectal cancer. if a person’s body mass index (bmi) is over 25 there is a 1. 5 fold increase in their risk. researchers also noted an increase in incidence of crc and death from crc if a person smoked. and in another study that compared those with diabetes and non-diabetics the risk of crc was 30% higher for the diabetic group. another factor that increases a person’s risk for crc is inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or crohn’s disease. inflammation throughout the gi tract may be the culprit which explains why aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs seem to protect against crc. finally if you have a family history of colorectal cancer you must be observed closely by your doctor. if you are diagnosed with colon polyps or have family members diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 55 years of age you should begin aggressive surveillance.	what are the risk factors for colorectal cancer?

i think it is reasonable to wait at least six weeks and only with the consent of the patient’s obstetrician. there are changes that the body undergoes after pregnancy as it kind of “shrinks down” if you will and returns to normal pre-pregnancy physiology. typically that is going to take place in the first several weeks and just to make sure we suggest a six-week interval between the delivery and the cosmetic procedure. it is never wrong to wait a bit longer because the patient might not quite feel up to it and has other new responsibilities as a parent. as indicated above a physical examination must be done including blood counts and all the necessary laboratory tests to know that at that point the patient’s body is functioning just as it would had the patient never been pregnant.	how long should i wait after my pregnancy before having cosmetic surgery?
sometimes patients are disappointed after rhinoplasty or nose surgery because various changes can evolve negatively in the postoperative period. one of the more common effects is the so-called “dropped tip. ” here’s what that means. initially when seen from the side the profile view the tip sits at a desirable level in relation to the rest of the nose’s profile. but with time the tip actually settles down drops and gives a round or convex appearance to the front half of the profile. it may look like a new bump has formed. there are several reasons why this happens. in most cases such a drop is predictable — and preventable. the first reason is that the surgeon fails to allow for an anticipated drop and therefore incorrectly sets the tip position in reference to the rest of the nasal profile including the bridge. it is well-known among experienced nasal surgeons that there will always be some downward contraction of the tip owing to the fact that their incisions tend to contract. the natural downward pull of gravity and contractile forces from those incisions will tend to make the tip drop. the surgeon must anticipate that during the planning of your operation and during its execution. the second common reason for the tip dropping is that there is not enough strength in the remaining tip cartilage to maintain its position. if the surgeon fails to recognize that the tip cartilage is weak and will not hold its posture after part of it has been removed to narrow the lower half of the nose then such a dropped tip will occur and the profile will be imperfect. an assessment of the prospects of that happening should take place at the consultation as the surgeon feels the strength of the nasal cartilages and makes an estimate as to what percentage of the strength can be maintained after a portion of the cartilage is removed. here is the analogy in architecture and construction: if you weaken a load-bearing support wall too much the roof will sag or come tumbling down. reason number three for the “dropped tip” is that in fact the tip does not drop but the tissue of the nose above the tip rises up and makes it look like the tip has dropped. this is generally due to the surgeon’s failure to anticipate the contraction and tightening that will certainly take place during healing. as swelling diminishes and the tissues begin to weld together an upward elevation of the cartilages in the midportion of the nose can occur. these “upper lateral” cartilages automatically and naturally migrate toward the middle and if they had not been trimmed enough in anticipation of this migration then they tend to rise above the anticipated profile level. thus a profile convexity occurs that makes the tip look as though it has dropped. an illusion has been created. rhinoplasty is a complex operation which requires imagination on the part of the surgeon a working game plan based on anticipated changes and most importantly a knowledge of the consequences of each and every surgical maneuver that takes place during the operation. no wonder rhinoplasty holds its reputation as the most difficult operation in the world of cosmetic plastic surgery. and remember not all plastic surgeons are equipped by training experience or talent to perform it.

the most important thing you can do is drink plenty of fluids. if you’re drinking enough your urine should be clear or light yellow. if you have calcium kidney stones -- the most common type -- eating less salt or salty foods may help. watch out for salt content in processed foods and in restaurants. you do not need to avoid calcium-rich foods and they may even help prevent another type of kidney stone being oxalate kidney stones. if you have oxalate kidney stones limiting foods high in oxalate may help such as dark green vegetables nuts and chocolate. other diet changes that may help include not eating too much protein increasing your fiber intake avoiding grapefruit juice and drinking real lemonade since the citrate from real lemons may help prevent kidney stones. if you take supplements ask your doctor about how much calcium and c and d vitamins you should be taking since these may increase your risk of kidney stones.	i've been dealing with kidney stones for 4 years now. what should i add or remove from my diet to avoid them?

"most of us have a sense of which eating and exercising habits (or lack thereof) have gotten us into trouble and stand in the way of our shedding pounds. it's staying motivated that's the hard part. but there may be help for you in unexpected places. how about a little help from. your employer? if you're not looking to your employee benefits or even your insurance company for help reaching your health goals you may be missing out.

thank you for the detailed information. i am happy to see your father improve gradually. here is what i suggest. there is no other medicine for stiffness. however physiotherapy should be carried out aggressively to prevent worsening of stiffness. one should rule out infection of the bed sore. if there is infection antibiotics are needed and rarely surgical debridement might be indicated. if there is no infection you can also apply phenytoin powder on the bed sore. the powder helps to hasten the healing process. i do see that there are chances of improvement. but i believe that he will not be able to do his daily activities independently and will remain dependent on others. in the latest scan i see that there is hydrocephalus also called post traumatic hydrocephalus. if the craniotomy flap is tense and there is increase in the water content in the brain he will benefit from ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery to relieve the water accumulation in the brain. this surgery can be done by the same neurosurgeon who performed the first surgery. i cannot comment whether he will be able to speak or not. all i can say is that he might improve in his sensorium (consciousness) some more. for further information consult a neurosurgeon online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My dad is without ventilator support since 40 days and his tracheostomy has also removed five days back.

i'm sorry to hear you are having a tough time. since it is tough to eat maybe drinking your nutrition would be better. you can try smoothies mixed with fruits veggies protein powder juice/milk and dairy ( some listed here ). you can also buy drinks like ensure which are fortified with vitamins and minerals. you can also try puree soups. drink with a straw to minimize liquids touching the areas of your mouth that are painful. if your symptoms persist consider visiting a registered dietitian. i hope you feel better soon!	i have shingles in my mouth very painful can't eat. suggestions of what foods/diet might help to get proper nutrition

strep is certainly less-likely since you no longer have tonsils as a bacterial reservoir. viral infections including mono can cause also white exudate on the throat so it may be wise to be properly examined to determine a cause.	i have a sore throat and i have white stuff on the back of my throat but not on my tonsils(i don't have any). strep?
both localized atrophy of the subcutaneous tissues and discoloration are well-known side effects of cortisone injections. sometimes these are the desired effects of the injection as when we inject steroids around nerve entrapments with the intent that the atrophy will decrease the pressure on the nerve. although one might prefer not to have the discoloration and atrophy from a cosmetic point of view these changes are not harmful.	is it normal to have a large area of skin discoloration and atrophy after a cortisone injection?

no. the drainage from the sinuses is quickly contaminated from nasal mouth and throat germs so you cannot diagnose sinusitis by this method. sinusitis is typically diagnosed by an array of characteristic symptoms (sinus pressure pain) coupled with corresponding examination findings (tenderness decreased light with transillumination - shining a bright light into the sinus area in a darkened room) or by x-ray or ct scan findings. most cases of sinusitis are viral and will be self-limiting but some require antibiotics or allergy mangement. see your medical provider.	can a lab test be done on coughed up mucus to determine if i have a sinus infection? . 10 days of coughing up thick yellow mucus facial pain all around sinus . antihistimines and mucinex seem to just mask symptoms but don't take away

i believe that women who are going to live now until 86 years of age that is the life expectancy for women that it only gets better and that they have to have an attitude spiritually emotionally and physically that they are going to do better in the next 40 years of their lives. and they are going to. women look great today. there are studies out there that show that the strength of a woman from exercising in her 60s can be the best ever so i really can tell you that you don’t have to look at this as a negative you just have to get through the rocky part and then once you get into the menopause and the hormones stabilize you can definitely just be so creative and move forward and have a positive experience and you know take charge of your life.	how will i feel after menopause?

no just the thc will cause a positive result and can remain in the system for quite a 2-3 weeks. omeprazole is not even close to the chemical structure of thc. there can be false positive drug tests but those are rare assuming it was tested at a good lab. webmd is incorrect in this instance. i know for a fact that omeprazole and all ppi's (proton pump inhibitors) can most definitely cause a false positive for thc. this is from several physicians (my own pain management doctor for one) and a relative who works for a testing firm that does drug testing for the federal government. yes prevacid or omeprazole can cause a false positive for thc. i tested myself at home in the a. m. and was negative for thc. i tested for the court in the p. m. after taking omeprazole (prilosec) and tested positive for thc. i called the company first check that makes the home test. they told me pantoprazole can cause a false positive but could not say for sure if omeprazole would cause a false positive. they recommend any positive test be mailed to them for mass spectometry testing which could rule out a false positive. twice i was jailed for testing positive and then was released after testing negative the next day when i hadn't taken omeprazole. only one time have i tested positive for thc at my pain clinic. i was extremely embarrassed and shocked! i am 52-years old and have not smoked pot since i was 19. i had just started a trial of omeprazole which my provider asked me about by name. i switched to another acid reducer at her suggestion and had no more problem. now i have done the rounds with these medications and it looks like omeprazole is all that's left. hopefully they will be reasonable. i have ulcerative colitis and gerd!	will omeprazole cause a positive thc result on a drug screen

nosebleeds that end within 5 or 10 minutes in children without any other signs of a bleeding problem are common and usually are not a sign of anything serious or dangerous. they may be caused by trauma from a bump to the nose or a child's picking and may occur when the weather is very dry or when a child has a cold or allergies. it can be helpful to use a humidifier or vaporizer and apply a small of petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment in the nostrils at bedtime to help the nasal tissue heal. for any more concerns or if a child has frequent or heavy nosebleeds in addition to bruising or easy bleeding that doesn't stop be sure to contact your pediatrician. .	could my 2 year old's nosebleeds be caused by dry air? how can i prevent this from happening?

i like that you still want to eat healthy even though you need to gain weight. i would say you should eat the same foods i would normally tell people to eat -- just more of them. stick to healthy foods like lean meats and beans whole grains healthy carbs like sweet potatoes and plenty of fruits and vegetables. since you need to gain weight you can include some of the higher-calorie foods in your diet like potatoes and pastas. it's easier to rack up the calories with carbs so eat up and enjoy. you could even splurge occasionally on sweets or other foods you crave. it's honestly fine for anyone to do that but you have a bit more freedom in your case. also if it's hard for you to eat a lot at one time eat more small meals throughout the day.	what kinds of healthy foods should i eat to gain weight?

there can be many causes for a baby’s fever. dehydration is one. or the infant might be over-bundled with clothes in a relatively warm environment. the rule of thumb is to dress your baby in just one more layer of clothing than you are comfortable in. most commonly fever is caused by an infection. the body’s immune system senses the “foreign invader” - such as bacteria or a virus - and sends a chemical message to the brain’s temperature center instructing it to crank up the heat inside the body. this has many advantages: some bacteria and viruses don’t like the higher temperature and are then more easily destroyed by the immune system. the higher body temperature helps the body to ward off the infection. in this way fever is actually our friend: it lets us know that an infection may be brewing and it helps to fight off the infection.	what causes a fever in babies?
"we tend to advise our patients to avoid high impact activities following hip and knee arthroplasty procedures. so we do not want people running or jumping if it can be avoided. there really is no consensus opinion about activities following hip and knee replacement. different surgeons will allow different amounts of activity. if a patient of mine wants to do some weight training i tend to advise them to avoid really heavy weights and focus more on ""reps"". i also tend to tell my patients to try to maintain exercise as they can because i certainly feel that the benefit gained from the exercise likely outweighs the wear seen by the implant. it is certain that you will have less wear if you do not exercise at at all but that will likely come at the expense of your overall health."	what type of exercises are ok after knee and hip replacement?
hi this is from medical. mit. edc how does herpes spread? hsv-1 is spread through contact with saliva including kissing and mouth-to-genital contact (oral sex). hsv-2 is usually transmitted by direct genital-to-genital or genital-to-anal contact. in the past hsv-2 was responsible for most cases of genital herpes. however recent research suggests that almost 80 percent of college students with genital herpes have hsv-1 probably due to high rates of oral sex in this group. remember a person with herpes doesn’t need to have symptoms to spread the virus to someone else. and this would include not ejaculating as there possibly could have been some pre-cum and it would have been in that. hope you told her. good luck	i am a male and a girl gives me oral sex and i don't ejaculate will she get oral or genital herpes
get a second opinion from another medical professional. get copies of your records including your lab tests and bring them to this next diagnostic visit. remember you have only had one opinion. one that you do not agree with so it is up to you to seek another opinion when you feel that you may be misdiagnosed. unfortunately fatigue is such a vague symptom (thousands of medical conditions can result in fatigue) that it would be impossible to blindly sort the diagnostic considerations blindly over the internet.	possible chronic fatigue misdiagnosis? constantly exhausted and unintentional weight loss of about 11lbs in 5 weeks! . i have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome after a whole host of tests were done. i do not actually think that i have cfs as i do not experience any cognitive /muscle problems etc- i only suffer from debilitating fatigue! . since my discharge i have lost weight rapidly (11lbs in 5 weeks which for a 20yr old female who was about 130lbs to begin with is quite significant! ). this combined with the fact that my only cfs symptom is fatigue makes me think that i have been misdiagnosed.

when a joint is swollen sometimes joint fluid is removed before cortisone is injected. if fluid is removed it can be analyzed to determine what caused the joint to swell. this is a big advantage as it is a powerful and accurate diagnostic test. a distinct benefit of a corticosteroid injection is that the relief of localized inflammation in a particular body area is more rapid and powerful than with traditional anti-inflammatory medications given by mouth such as aspirin. a single injection also can avoid certain side effects notably irritation of the stomach that can accompany many oral anti-inflammatory medications. cortisone injections can be administered easily in the doctor's office. other advantages include the rapid onset of the medication's action dependability and minimal side effects.	what are the advantages of cortisone injections?

tumors that begin in brain tissue are known as primary tumors of the brain. primary brain tumors are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they begin. the most common primary brain tumors are gliomas. they begin in glial cells. there are many types of gliomas: astrocytoma -- the tumor arises from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes. in adults astrocytomas most often arise in the cerebrum. in children they occur in the brain stem the cerebrum and the cerebellum. a grade iii astrocytoma is sometimes called an anaplastic astrocytoma. a grade iv astrocytoma is usually called a glioblastoma multiforme. brain stem glioma -- the tumor occurs in the lowest part of the brain. brain stem gliomas most often are diagnosed in young children and middle-aged adults. ependymoma -- the tumor arises from cells that line the ventricles or the central canal of the spinal cord. they are most commonly found in children and young adults. oligodendroglioma -- this rare tumor arises from cells that make the fatty substance that covers and protects nerves. these tumors usually occur in the cerebrum. they grow slowly and usually do not spread into surrounding brain tissue. they are most common in middle-aged adults. some types of brain tumors do not begin in glial cells. the most common of these are: medulloblastoma -- this tumor usually arises in the cerebellum. it is the most common brain tumor in children. it is sometimes called a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. meningioma -- this tumor arises in the meninges. it usually grows slowly. schwannoma -- a tumor that arises from a schwann cell. these cells line the nerve that controls balance and hearing. this nerve is in the inner ear. the tumor is also called an acoustic neuroma. it occurs most often in adults. craniopharyngioma -- the tumor grows at the base of the brain near the pituitary gland. this type of tumor most often occurs in children. germ cell tumor of the brain -- the tumor arises from a germ cell. most germ cell tumors that arise in the brain occur in people younger than 30. the most common type of germ cell tumor of the brain is a germinoma. pineal region tumor -- this rare brain tumor arises in or near the pineal gland. the pineal gland is located between the cerebrum and the cerebellum.	what are primary brain tumors?

the terms latent and silent celiac disease are used to refer to patients who have inherited the genes that predispose them to celiac disease but have not yet developed the symptoms or signs of celiac disease. latent celiac disease refers specifically to patients who have abnormal antibody blood tests for celiac disease but who have normal small intestines and no signs or symptoms of celiac disease. for example: some patients may have had a childhood onset of celiac disease and the disease may have been successfully treated with a gluten-free diet. the patients' intestines may have resumed a normal appearance and function and they may have no signs or symptoms of celiac disease. some patients with celiac disease in childhood abandon the gluten-free diet as adults yet they remain free of the signs or symptoms of celiac disease. in both of the above instances the celiac disease is latent and the patients can develop signs and symptoms of celiac disease later in life. silent celiac disease refers to patients who have abnormal antibody blood tests for celiac disease as well as loss of villi in the small intestine but have no symptoms or signs of celiac disease even on a normal diet that contains gluten. like patients with latent celiac disease these patients can develop signs or symptoms of celiac disease later in life.	what is latent and silent celiac disease?

it's true that antioxidants will break down over time once you open it to the air. but they do have preservatives that help stabilize them to prevent that breakdown. if you start to see the color change of those products that's a sign that they are breaking down. keeping the jar closed tightly or keeping it in the refrigerator will help somewhat but i often find that when i keep something in the refrigerator i am too tired or lazy at the end of the day to go get it from there so i don't end up using it and then it does no good at all. so if you are very motivated and you will go to the refrigerator every time you want to use it that's fine. but chances are you will use that product up before it breaks down if you are using it enough so you don't have to worry about it.	i read that open jar packaging oxidizes the anti-aging ingredients in moisturizers. will it last longer in the fridge?
"i'm sorry to hear you're feeling anxious about your penis size and how it might affect your sexual performance. and i want to assure you your feelings are perfectly normal. i think all men go through a period of insecurity regarding their penis size. society puts a lot of emphasis on this particular aspect of ""masculinity "" after all. i hasten to assure you that your penis probably is perfectly normal in size. but your best bet to completely set your mind at ease about the situation is to make an appointment with a urologist. he or she can examine you and tell you if everything's ok. also you may be surprised to learn that medically speaking penis size isn't measured based on the erect organ. rather penis size is measured by ""stretched penis length. "" the article i linked above will give you a lot of information about average penis length how to measure your penis and when to see a doctor. i hope this helps set your mind at ease! don't worry about it. the average penis in america is 6 inches. i to am not well endowed but my wife love mine. she says it is just right and doesn't hurt her. you are probably going by the magazines and movies. trust me they are not normal sized. we are created individually and when you find mrs. right she won't care. there are excersizes that will enlarge thickness and length. they do work. it is a slow process but it can be done. also some of the enlargement drugs that is on the market do enlarge by increasing the blood flow and amount that the penis will tolerate. again its a slow process but it is possible. there are also excersizes to allow you to last for very long time before you climax that really turns your mate on. also with time you will learn to satisify the woman and not yourself. if you strive to satisify your mate she will hold on for life and do the same for you. if you are lucky enough to find a virgin to marry someday god will match you perfectly."	im 19 my penis is under 5inch when erect. is this normal? help i'm scared to have sexual intercourse.

"well my best suggestion is to seek medical attention. under most circumstances it's not a good idea to pop any lump or bump that comes up under the skin particularly if it doesn't have a visible ""head. "" it's especially not a good idea to use a thumbtack to pop skin lumps. lancing boils and other skin lesions is better left to professionals. wihle you're waiting for an appointment with your primary care provider keep the hole clean by washing with plain soap and rinsing with water. if you're not allergic to any medications you also can put an antibiotic ointment (such as neosporin or generic ""triple antibiotic ointment"") on the hole to help guard against infection. if you develop a fever; hot red swelling at the puncture site; pain that gets worse instead of better; or feeling like you're coming down with the flu you should go to an urgent care facility as these can be signs of an infection. i wish you the best of luck with this!"	i had a cyst (? ) on my pubic area so i tried to pop it with a thumb tack and now there is a hole. what should i do? . i'm not sure if it was a cyst but one morning i woke up with a grape sized lump under my skin so i pushed it and it felt like a tire deflated and it popped under the skin.
yes. it is possible to be allergic to a milkshake or other dessert made from ice cream but not to plain milk. you may be reacting to one of the other ingredients found in these desserts other than milk. but it is also possible that exposure to the cold is triggering some sort of reaction. mcdonald’s lists the specific ingredients that are used in their desserts on their website. besides milk and ice cream other things that may cause an allergic reaction in some people include: peanuts almonds sweeteners preservatives chocolate flavorings wheat and artificial colorings. talk to your doctor about a referral to an allergist. testing may help narrow down the cause of your symptoms. in the meantime avoid any food that has caused a reaction in the past.	can i be allergic to milkshake but not to milk? . actually every time i eat milkshake or ice cream such as mcflurry at mcdonald few minutes later i start coughing in a strange way and i fell weak. but i can drink cow milk or cheese or anything without felling anything. my doctor told me that was an allergic reaction but he doesn't know to what. so do you have any idea? thanks.
the penis is covered with skin and clearly your penile skin is sensitive to the type of soap that you used. any soap can result in dry skin so it is best to use some moisturizing lotion and/or hydrocortisone cream to clear up the skin dryness. give your penis a rest until the skin improves.	hello i stupidly jacked off with soap. hello i stupidly jacked off with soap the other day and now i have a scaly penis which is hard to get erect can i fix it? its been like this for 3 or four days and i don't know what to do. the shaft is scaly and peels sometimes. also at some part it turns white which i think is dead skin. the shaft doesnt feel right as well.
in the short term gaining the suggested amount of weight reduces the risk of preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) and promotes a baby that isn't too big or too small at delivery. in the long run research suggests that the greater the weight gain during pregnancy the higher the risk of having an overweight child and one with higher blood pressure. children who are born too small which can result from inadequate weight gain during pregnancy are more prone to certain chronic conditions including heart disease and diabetes during adulthood. what if you miss the mark for recommended weight gain? if you're off by just a few pounds either way it probably won't make much of a difference. the iom (institute of medicine) guidelines provide a range in each bmi category suggesting that good outcomes are achieved with all different weight gains. listen to the advice of your doctor or nurse-midwife about weight gain but if you have doubts ask what's right for you.	what happens if i gain too much or too little during pregnancy?

for the majority of children suffering hair loss one of the following conditions is the cause. your child's pediatrician or a pediatric dermatologist should be able to diagnose these conditions and prescribe the appropriate treatment. tinea capitis. tinea capitis commonly known as ringworm of the scalp is a fungal infection often seen in children. it can show up in a number of ways but often as scaly patches of hair loss on the head. the patches are usually round or oval. the hairs may be broken off at the surface of the skin and look like black dots on the scalp. because ringworm is contagious your child should be careful not to share any objects that touch the head such as hats pillow cases or brushes. alopecia areata. alopecia areata is a non-contagious condition of hair loss thought to be caused by the body's immune system attacking the hair follicles. it is characterized by the sudden appearance of round or oval patches of hair loss. the patches are slick or smooth without scaling or broken hairs. about 25% of children also have pitting and ridging of the nails. while there is no cure for alopecia areata treatment can control the disease in some children. many have their hair back within a year although regrowth is unpredictable and many will lose hair again. for about 5% of children the disease progresses to alopecia totalis -- loss of all of the hair on the scalp. some of these will develop alopecia universalis -- a total loss of body hair. trichotillomania. trichotillomania is hair loss caused by pulling plucking twisting or rubbing. the hair loss is patchy and characterized by broken hairs of varying length. patches are typically seen on the side of the child's dominant hand. trichotillomania may be triggered by a stressor in your child's life such as the loss of a grandparent birth of a sibling or a divorce. if you notice your child pulling hair scolding will not likely be helpful. however counseling to help your child deal with the source of stress that triggered the habit may help stop it. telogen effluvium. telogen effluvium is a condition in which a sudden or severe stress -- such as extremely high fever surgery under general anesthesia the death of a loved one a severe injury or the use of certain prescription medications -- interrupts the normal cycle of hair growth. the hair follicles stop growing prematurely and enter a resting phase (called the telogen phase). between six and 16 weeks later hair sheds excessively leading to partial or complete baldness. there are no conclusive tests to diagnose telogen effluvium; there is also no treatment for it. however once the stressful event is over full hair growth usually returns within six months to a year. nutritional deficiency. though less common hair loss can be a symptom of deficiencies in certain nutrients including: vitamin h or biotin one of the b complex of vitamins which help the body to convert carbohydrates into glucose to fuel the body. zinc an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism. it also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy childhood and adolescence. in some cases hair loss can be a symptom of too much vitamin a. with a healthy varied diet most children will not experience nutritional deficiencies that lead to hair loss. however if you suspect a problem speak to your child's doctor before giving nutritional supplements. endocrine problems. in some children the cause of hair loss is hypothyroidism a condition in which the thyroid is underactive and is producing an insufficient amount of thyroid hormones required for regulating metabolism. a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is made by a blood test and possibly a scan of the thyroid gland.	what are the medical causes of hair loss in children?

the primary function of the gallbladder is to store bile a brown or yellowish fluid that helps the body break down fatty food. when you eat a meal the gallbladder releases its stored bile into the cystic duct. from there the fluid passes through the common bile duct and into the small intestine to mix with food. chief among the ingredients of bile are cholesterol and bile acids. normally the concentration of bile acids is high enough to break down the cholesterol in the mixture and keep it in liquid form. however a diet high in fat can tip this delicate balance causing the liver to produce more cholesterol than the bile acids are able to handle. as a result some of this excess cholesterol begins to solidify into crystals which we call gallstones. about 80% of all gallstones are called cholesterol stones and are created this way. the remaining 20% consist of calcium mixed with the bile pigment bilirubin and are called pigment stones. gallstones can form even in people who eat properly. and as researchers have found a diet extremely low in fat can also contribute to gallstone formation: with little fatty food to digest the gallbladder is called into play less frequently than usual so the cholesterol has more time to solidify. other factors that can reduce activity in the gallbladder possibly leading to gallstone formation include cirrhosis the use of birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy and pregnancy. family history diabetes sudden weight loss and cholesterol drugs and older age can also increase risk for gallstones.	what causes gallstones?

"the removal of pubic hair is not medically-beneficial in any way nor does it protect you from pubic lice. the removal of pubic hair is only a cosmetic fad. i don't know about the lice or stds but i know i feel cleaner by shaving. i also used to get a fair amount of yeast infections when i was younger and didn't shave. and i'm happy to say that in the 30 yrs since i've been shaving i haven't had even one infection. that tells me i've removed the moist warm ""habitat"" for some infections. and my ob-gyn agrees with me on that. plus everything is better all the way around. hi the doc says its a fad some fad i personally have been shaved for way over 50 years my wife since we were married in 1970. i do love the feeling of being clean so dose my wife. doctors in the uk see lots of clean shaven women but there not sure if they do this when they come in to be seen or there like it all the time. but i think your find there is a whole lot of us who are true smoothies and love being that way its just so nice to be clean. you have to remember there are a lot of people who do love to be that extra bit clean and shaving dose that and really good when it comes to sex. smoothies unit. good luck"	is pubic hair removal dangerous or needed for hygiene? . some doctors claim this has lead to pubic lice becoming almost extinct without moist/warm habitat for lice and other infections which can be passed on as sti's so pubic hair removal is a benaficial thing. on the other hand doctors claim that when the hair is removed it leaves a 'microscopic open wound' which can also lead to infections and std's also skin irritations and can be equally dangerous. so which is true and is pubic hair removal a good or dangerous thing to do?

migraine is a chronic condition of recurrent attacks. most (but not all) migraine attacks are associated with headaches. migraine headaches usually are described as an intense throbbing or pounding pain that involves one temple. (sometimes the pain is located in the forehead around the eye or in the back of the head). the pain usually is unilateral (on one side of the head) although about a third of the time the pain is bilateral. the unilateral headaches typically change sides from one attack to the next. (in fact unilateral headaches that always occur on the same side should alert the doctor to consider a secondary headache for example one caused by a brain tumor). a migraine headache usually is aggravated by daily activities such as walking upstairs. nausea vomiting diarrhea paleness cold hands cold feet and sensitivity to light and sound commonly accompany migraine headaches. as a result of this sensitivity to light and sound migraine sufferers usually prefer to lie in a quiet dark room during an attack. a typical attack lasts between four and 72 hours. an estimated 40% to 60% of migraine attacks are preceded by premonitory (warning) symptoms lasting hours to days. the symptoms may include sleepiness irritability fatigue depression or euphoria yawning and cravings for sweet or salty foods. patients and their family members usually know that when they observe these warning symptoms that a migraine attack is beginning. an estimated 20% of migraine headaches are associated with an aura. usually the aura precedes the headache although occasionally it may occur simultaneously with the headache. the most common auras are 1) flashing brightly colored lights in a zigzag pattern (fortification spectra) usually starting in the middle of the visual field and progressing outward and 2) a hole (scotoma) in the visual field also known as a blind spot. some elderly migraine sufferers may experience only the visual aura without the headache. a less common aura consists of pins-and-needles sensations in the hand and the arm on one side or pins-and-needles sensations around the mouth and the nose on the same side. other auras include auditory (hearing) hallucinations and abnormal tastes and smells. complicated migraines are migraines that are accompanied by neurological dysfunction. the part of the body that is affected by the dysfunction is determined by the part of the brain that is responsible for the headache. vertebrobasilar migraines are characterized by dysfunction of the brain stem (the lower part of the brain that is responsible for automatic activities like consciousness and balance). the symptoms of vertebrobasilar migraines include fainting as an aura vertigo (dizziness in which the environment seems to be spinning) and double vision. hemiplegic migraines are characterized by paralysis or weakness of one side of the body or mimicking a stroke. the paralysis or weakness is usually temporary but sometimes it can last for days. retinal or ocular migraines are rare attacks characterized by repeated instances of scotomata (blind spots) or blindness on one side lasting less than an hour that can be associated with headache. irreversible vision loss can be a complication of this rare form of migraine. for approximately 24 hours after a migraine attack the migraine sufferer may feel drained of energy and may experience a low-grade headache along with sensitivity to light and sound. unfortunately some sufferers may have recurrences of the headache during this period.	what are the symptoms of migraine headaches?

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. but i have good news: your problem probably can be fixed. it's not uncommon for women to develop bladder leakage especially after having children. the leakage (or in your case gushing) can be caused by several things from a prolapsed bladder to a weak bladder muscle. your health care provider can diagnose the cause of your bladder leakage and suggest the appropriate treatment which can range from medication to an outpatient surgical procedure. i suggest you make an appointment with your gynecologist or primary healthcare provider to have this problem diagnosed. you've suffered long enough! best wishes to you!	why is it that sometimes when i have to pee when i stand up it just pours out and i can't cut it off. i have had two children and have always peed often ever since i was a child but the older i get the worse it gets somtime i don't make it at all.

"you are wise to be concerned but take it one step further. insist that your boyfriend use a condom so that you are not exposed to any of his bodily fluids during sexual activity; oral or otherwise. oral sex is often a gateway activity to other more-risky sexual acts so set the parameters now. no condom no sex play. were you not aware that humans lie or omit the ""whole truth""? while your boyfriend may be one of those rare young men who has honestly disclosed his past sexual activity do you think he would automatically disclose a one-night stand with someone else while you are dating? be wise! your risk may be minimal now but stds can be transmitted orally without ejaculation."	is pre cum enough to catch something? . i'm a virgin but recently i've engaged in oral sex for the first time with my boy friend. i was not fond of it so i stopped long before he's ejaculated so nothing went in my mouth aside from some pre-cum. i am very anxious though and was wondering if that was enough to catch anything? hiv std etc? he's only had sex with one other female who was a virgin at that time and so was he. he's received oral from another female as well. based off of those two factors i believe he's clean as well.

no this is not a sign of bruising but it may be a sign of contact reaction. since the redness and swelling has occurred in both hands at the same time there is a possibility that he picked up more than just a sand bag. if he picked up or handled cement this is an entirely different problem. cement does cause the hands to become red and irritated. did he put his handprint into some fresh cement? i think you need to do a little more investigation of a nine-year old boy's day.	my son 8 years old has swollen and red hands. he was picking up a sand bag yesterday is this a sign of brusing?

it would not be possible to blindly answer that question. not knowing your medical history or having the ability to examine you makes it nearly impossible to address your concern. i would strongly suggest that you make an appointment with a women's health care provider so you can be properly examined.	whenever i masturbate or have sex i am in lots of pain. i'm a sexually active female. what's wrong with me? . there are times when i bleed slightly. and then after everything is all done my vagina burns if i try to use the bathroom. this happens also even when i masturbate. i use protection when i have sex. but the burning only happens right after everything is done. it never goes longer than a few hours. so i just don't know what it all means. i have been sexually active for almost five years now and this problem keeps occurring whenever i want to do something.

there are a couple different versions of excedrin available but it typically contains acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. ibuprofen is a pain reliever that is very similar to aspirin. taking both ibuprofen and excedrin together will probably not be beneficial and may cause harm. taken together these medications will likely cause stomach upset and may lead to a stomach ulcer. i would not recommend this particular combination. if one product or the other is not sufficient for your pain talk with your local pharmacist or health care provider who could suggest other options depending on the type of pain that you are experiencing.	can you mix ibuprofen and excedrin for pain relief?
get pregnant and have your baby when you want it. you cannot rely on the judgment and family planning recommendations of a three-year old. you don't need to reassure him now that having siblings is not a bad thing. if you are waiting until he is four your son will be a different stage in his development and the idea of being a big brother may not seem as bad. six months into your next pregnancy is plenty of time to prepare him for a new baby in the home. since most four year olds go to pre-school and develop friend relationships a sibling will not likely be an issue.	how can i help my 3 year old son to want a sibling in one year or more to come. he just wants mom&dad no siblings. i plan to have my second child when my son is 4 and a half. he is 3 years old now and i started talking about it to him to get him ready for that but he would say i don't want a sibling i just want you and dad. how can i make my son interested in it so that he won't be aggressive to new baby when it comes to family? we don't see new born babies around us in our relatives or friends to get him interested in the subject so i need to know how to help it. thank you so much.

unfortunately you may need to wait until june. it would not be possible to determine the reason why you have never had a menstrual cycle over the internet. the causes are many and we do not know anything about your medical history or have any way of examining you. and yes pcos can be one of the causes to consider. a work-up may be expensive so waiting until june would be prudent.	why am i 19 and still haven't had a period? ! . i am 19 and have never had a period. pcos is very common in my family and i am wondering if that is what caused it or what. my husband and i really would like to start our family and have been trying to for the last two years and nothing has happened. i really need as much information as possible because i don't have insurance until june. thank you.

go to your doctor and get tested for genital herpes. a doctor may take a sample from what appears to be a genital herpes sore and examine it under a microscope. you can also have a blood test for genital herpes. the blood test looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system would have made when you were infected. the second type of herpes simplex virus hsv-2 almost always infects the genitals so if antibodies to hsv-2 are detected in your blood you probably have genital herpes. a blood test that shows antibodies to the other type of herpes virus hsv-1 means you could have genital or oral herpes. that's because oral herpes typically caused by hsv-1 can be spread to the genitals during oral sex.	how can i find out if i've been infected with genital herpes?

here are a few tips that will help with gastritis. eat smaller more frequent meals. if you are having frequent indigestion eating smaller more frequent meals will help to ease the effects of stomach acid. avoid irritating foods. avoid foods that irritate your stomach especially those that are spicy acidic fried or fatty foods. you might also keep a log of what you eat to find other foods that are irritating. drink alcohol in moderation if at all. excessive use of alcohol can irritate the mucous lining of your stomach. for women limit yourself to one drink a day or two drinks a day if you’re a man. consider switching pain relievers. if you use pain relievers regularly ask your doctor whether acetaminophen (tylenol) may be an option for you. this medication is less likely to irritate your stomach problem. manage stress. stress may make your gastritis symptoms worse. if you have trouble relaxing consider trying calming activities such as meditation yoga and tai chi. for more information visit this link.	is there a diet that will help with gastritis?

you're wise to check your own blood pressure regularly after being put on medication for high blood pressure. doing this will help your health care provider titrate (fine-tune) your medication dosage appropriately. clinically low blood pressure is defined as anything under 90/60. (this can vary depending on the fitness level and age of the individual. ) if you've been placed on medication for high blood pressure you can consider a consistent reading below 90/60 as being too low. a normal adult resting pulse rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. it's not unusual for a person's heart rate to occasional go above 100 beats per minute however especially during any type of activity or exercise. if you experience sustained resting pulse rates over 120 then it would be a good idea to call your health care provider. because you feel abnormally tired and sleepy you might make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your blood pressure treatment. there are many blood pressure medications available and if this combination isn't working for you your doctor can try something else. i wish you all the best!	when is your blood pressure to low? and when is your pulse to high? . i was recently put on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. i am concerned because i am staying tired and sleepy. i keep a check on my blood pressure but would like to know what is considered to low. also my pulse rate ranges from 70's to 90's. has hit 100 and 103 a couple times. what is a safe pulse rate?

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. yes you should have this checked out as soon as possible. if you can get in to see your primary care provider (pcp) quickly that would be your best bet. if you can't get an office visit at least try to speak with your pcp's nurse. since your pcp has all your medical history his or her office is in the best position to advise you what to do about this. a headache that doesn't go away is always a reason to see a health care provider. long-term headaches can be a symptom of a larger problem. i wish you all the best with this!	if my headache has lasted for 5 days and nothing is helping should i go to a doctor? . i have had a headache for a little over five days. i was also diagnosed with a pitituary cysit a few years ago. no otcs are helping nor are my perscriptions. it keeps getting worse. my joints hurt and i keep getting muscle cramps.
most helpful answer just wait. and sweat it out a few more days. while the chance of an unintended pregnancy is not very high you do seem to be aware that the leakage of semen may contain viable baby-causing sperm. something you are trying to prevent. the birth control pill is highly effective. adding the condom makes it even more effective. i suspect your girlfriend will have a normal period and not be pregnant but try and be very very careful. remember that the only 100% way of preventing pregnancy is abstinence -- not having sex at all. thanks god. still a bit afraid. thank you very much sir. you saved my day.	read the details i can't write it all in here. -both fifteen. -not sure if some drops of precum got on the condom. -really stressed right now. it's about my girldfriend. ofcourse she takes tha anti-baby pill daily. but we're still afraid. we think some drops of precum have got in. but not very sure. tomorrow her period should start but i can't wait so long. i already can't sleep well. ps: we're fifteen. what should we do?
sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you've done the right thing by seeing your doctor and having your heart and kidneys checked out. i'm not sure why you're taking aspirin unless your doctor specifically recommended you take it. aspirin will not address the swelling issue you describe. aspirin will treat swelling due to inflammation (such as from an injury) to some extent but it will not have any effect on swelling due to edema (water retention) which is what you seem to be describing. i suggest you discontinue the aspirin unless otherwise directed by your doctor. it is not uncommon for people to retain fluid in the legs as they age. even very active people can have issues with fluid retention in the legs simply because the veins don't work as well when we age. i suggest you return to your doctor to discuss the issue in more detail. it's possible as you say he does not have an answer for the swelling problem. but it's also possible the issue simply requires more investigation to arrive at a diagnosis. if you're concerned about the swelling and frequent urination (i would be! ) then that's a good enough reason to return to your doctor for more conversation. wishing you well!	age 83. swelling both ankles. reduced salt. heart kidney ok. swelling ankles periodic. dr. checked heart kidney ok. bp fluctuating 110 to 155. do take potassium gluconate 50 mg. profuse urination. three times during night. had radical prostactomy 13 years ago. psa 0. 5 from 0. 05 in 13 years. aspirin 175 mg. helpful to some extent. swelling some time last many days. no other problem. why it could be? my dr. has no answer.

no yeast infections are caused by. yeast. yeast likes warm dark moist places and the vagina tends to fit the environmental conditions. whether you have hair or not in the pubic area has no influence on yeast so i suggest that you consult your medical provider for a definite treatment like oral difucan.	can getting a brazillian wax cause yeast infections? . since i started getting brazilian waxes a few months ago i feel as though i have a yeast infection on and off. right when it gets to the point where i'm about to go to the doctor it goes away but a few days later pops back up. i did go to the doctor once and got medication for the yeast infection but within a week after taking the medicine it started back up. i've never been prone to yeast infections before and the only major difference is that instead of shaving i started to get a wax.
sysron ncr (norethisterone) is basically a hormone which is used to control heavy bleeding during periods. i am afraid that sysron ncr does not have any contraceptive action in it. you must take precautions to not get pregnant during its use. your partner can use barrier methods like condoms. you can also try oral contraceptive pills which will also bring down the flow during your period. it will act in two ways. contraception regularizing your cycle and bringing down flow. you must take doctor's advise before starting any new drug. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am 36 years old.

does your teen get fewer than eight hours? if so listen up: your teen is more at risk for obesity and all the health problems connected to that (high blood pressure heart disease stroke etc. ). the link between sleep deprivation and a higher risk for obesity and related cardiovascular problems may not seem obvious. but here’s the key: when you’re sleep deprived (and yes for the vast majority of teens fewer than eight hours on a regular basis qualifies as being sleep deprived) you’ll crave high carbohydrate foods — especially those that are loaded with fat salt and sugar. i know it’s not fair to crave junk food when we’re already lacking in the sleep department but you can blame our ancient dna on this fact. encoded in our genes are signals to eat like this when we’re tired. hormones that control our signals of hunger and conversely fullness get thrown out of whack when we are sleep deprived. in a new study published this month in the journal sleep researchers determined that teens can’t escape this hard-wired reality that adults are saddled with. though plenty of studies in recent years have implicated obesity with sleep deprivation in adults not many have been performed on younger generations to find similar associations. in this latest study researchers found sleep-deprived teens: * consumed 2. 2 percent more calories from fat. * ate more snacks than those who slept eight hours or more a night. * ate more total calories. and you know what that spells: weight gain. when we think of adolescents losing out on sleep our minds quickly turn to potential accidents and an inability to concentrate or perform well in school. studies like this highlight the health consequences of sleep deprivation. the health repercussions of sleep deprivation at this “tender” age may actually be worse than those of an adult. for starters teens are establishing habits they will keep for a lifetime. a teen who gets used to eating poorly and packing on the pounds will likely grow into an overweight adult when it’ll be that much harder to change those habits and lose the excess weight. the more fatty foods you eat the more you crave them. secondly we’re only beginning to understand the biomechanics of a developing person’s metabolism. do teens who begin to have metabolic disturbances early in life suffer from a lifetime of irreversible higher health risks? it wouldn’t surprise me. and those higher risks may go far beyond just obesity and cardiovascular challenges. they may in fact go as far as upping the risk for cancer. so thirdly it’s a foregone conclusion: teens need their sleep as much as adults do.	why do teens need at least eight hours of sleep?
as you may have read on the label dimetapp is not to be used in children under age six. thus you should not give it to your child unless your pediatrician tells you it's ok. you may also wish to ask your pharmacist about this. i can think of several situations in which it could be all right to give dimetapp to a five-year-old but i cannot go into them on this public forum. for one thing i know nothing about your child and his/her medical history. your pharmacist however can give you accurate information about whether or not an over-the-counter cough and cold remedy would be appropriate for your child. wishing you well!	can i give my 5 year old dimetapp cold and cough medicine
mono can cause the liver and/or spleen to enlarge to the point that it is vulnerable to a blunt injury not uncommon in soccer. assuming that she does not have liver or spleen enlargement and her liver enzymes (a blood test) are normal she may be able to play. the doctor really should not have left it up to you. i agree. this is really a medical decision based on physical exam findings. mono can be mild. and mono can be very problematic so unfortunately without knowing the details of her particular case and of course those critical physical examination and lab findings you will need to put the ball back in the doctor's court to make this decision. yes she can. mononucleosis usually isn't very serious. it may subside on its own. in some cases they become immune to the disease. you may start her with herbs that increase general immunity like tinospora curcuma and triphala powder all in equal quantity at dose of 3 gms twice daily.	daughter tested positive for mono. the only symptom is swollen lymph nodes in her neck. can she play soccer? . she has no fever no swollen spleen no sore throat no fatigue. dr left it up to us whether or not she should play! just want to hear other opinions.

"the different types of lupus include: systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is the most common form. the word ""systemic"" means that the disease can involve many parts of the body. sle symptoms can be mild or serious. discoid lupus erythematosus mainly affects the skin. a red rash may appear or the skin on the face scalp or elsewhere may change color. drug-induced lupus is triggered by a few medicines. it's like sle but symptoms are usually milder. most of the time the disease goes away when the medicine is stopped. more men develop drug-induced lupus because the drugs that cause it hydralazine and procainamide are used to treat heart conditions that are more common in men."	are there different types of lupus?

hi according to your statement the cum leaked from the bottom of the condom on your hip. generally this is not a cause for worry. however if some semen might have leaked while you were inside her without you knowing. some antibiotics weaken the effect of birth control. so it is better to go for plan b. don't use a used condom as they become loose after sometimes. get a new one each time.	if we cont to have sex with a used condom for a few strokes and some cum leaked out the bottom on my hip is she pregnant. the condom didn't break i made sure by doing the water test. and she has been on birth control but has been on antibiotics for a week. then stopped taking the antibiotics 2-3 days before our sex. should i get plan b?
i can't tell if you mean you haven't had a period in 10 months and now you're bleeding or if you just stopped your hrt and now you're bleeding for 2 weeks. either way. yes if you have been bleeding for 2 weeks you should see your doctor. your body may need help adjusting to stopping the hrt (if you recently stopped it). your doctor may need to give you something to stop the bleeding. the concern would be that if you're losing a lot of blood you could develop anemia. so at this point the bleeding may need to be stopped and that requires a visit to your doctor. if you haven't had a period in 10 months and you're bleeding now you definitely need to be seen to determine what's causing the bleeding.	i have gone9mo this time10mos prviously after stoppinghrtsincehaving period. have been bleeding 2 wks. should i see my md?

i'd say if this has been going on for several days that you should seek medical attention. you may not necessarily need to rush to the emergency room but you should at least call your primary care provider. several conditions can cause the symptoms you're describing including appendicitis an ovarian cyst (which is not cancer so don't get alarmed) or gallstones. it's impossible to say what's going on without getting a physical exam. if you begin to exhibit any of the following symptoms then you should go to the emergency room: fever over 101f vomiting yellowing of eyes or skin pain getting much worse instead of better difficulty breathing/shortness of breath i hope you feel better soon!	right side of tummy hurts <negative_smiley>. i'm 16 the right side of my tummy. not the right side of my stomach but like under my right boob. . at first it hurt a little to the left of my right hip bone then it moved up to the right side of my belly button. it hurts on the inside not the skin. feels like sharp pain but not too sharp. it started around saturday morning. . . i've been hitting in and rubbing it deeply a lot do you think that made it worse? what is this pain i'm feeling?

surgery to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for penile cancer. a doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following operations: wide local excision takes out only the cancer and some normal tissue on either side. electrodessication and curettage removes the cancer by scraping the tumor with a curette (thin long instrument with a scraping edge) and applying an electric current to the area to kill cancer cells. cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the cancer cells. microsurgery (moh's surgery) is an operation that removes the cancer and as little normal tissue as possible. during this surgery the doctor uses a microscope to look at the cancerous area to make sure all the cancer cells are removed. laser surgery uses a narrow beam of light to remove cancer cells. circumcision is an operation that removes the foreskin. amputation of the penis (penectomy) is an operation that removes the penis. it is the most common and most effective treatment of cancer of the penis. in a partial penectomy part of the penis is removed. in a total penectomy the whole penis is removed. lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery. radiation which uses high-energy rays to attack cancer and chemotherapy which uses drugs to kill cancer are other treatment options.	what treatments are given for penile cancer?

quadrivalent (four virus) flu vaccines are expected to be at least as effective as trivalent (three virus) vaccines since both flu vaccines protect against three of the same influenza viruses. if an influenza b virus that is different from the trivalent vaccine influenza b component circulates the quadrivalent flu vaccine might provide better protection than trivalent flu vaccines by protecting against this additional influenza b virus. cdc evaluates the effectiveness of available flu vaccines throughout the flu season but the quantity and quality of data necessary to compare the effectiveness of different types of flu vaccine usually aren’t available until after the flu season is over and even then can be limited by what vaccine options people purchase or use during the season.	is quadrivalent vaccine more effective than trivalent?
hi this below is from nuvaring. nuvaring is used in a 4-week cycle. keep nuvaring in your vagina for 3 weeks (21 days) and then remove it for a 1 week (7 day) break. the ring should be inserted and removed on the same day of the week and at the same time. (for example if you insert your nuvaring on a monday at 8:00 a. m. you should remove it on the monday 3 weeks later at 8:00 a. m. ) you will usually get your period during the 1-week break that you remove nuvaring. insert a new nuvaring after the 1-week break. the new ring should be inserted on the same day of the week and at the same time that you inserted it the last month even if your period has not stopped. or like some women do is to keep just replacing the ring to get no periods if so then you will never no where you are then perhaps you should start again as above. hope this helps your problem. good luck	when do i do a pregnancy test while i have a nuvaring? . i don't cycle off of the nuvaring so that i don't get periods which give me unbearable cramps. i over think things a lot. i question if my birth control is working properly. i took many pregnancy tests over the last 3 days due to the fact that for the first day it said i was positive and the next 2 days it said i was negative. i did have some vaginal bleeding first day. i'm getting a blood test but i heard results are only accurate a few days before a period. and i don't know when my period is

capadex is the newest addition to the proton pump inhibitor family. it actually works and sits in your stomach and has a special mechanism that it's delayed as it releases. so therefore the drug stays around longer in your system. it is actually used for treating of ulcers as well as gerd. one of the things is that the side effects would be very similar to the class effects with other ppis. so constipation diarrhea nausea dizziness. i do encourage patients though to see how they are feeling as they are taking this new medication encourage them to keep a diary of their symptoms to see if it's helping. we are finding out that patients basically on medications react differently to different ones and your therapy may have to be individualized. so after a month and you are not feeling so well you come to the pharmacist we find that out we may refer you back to your physician. because that might not be the right choice you may have to be put on a different type of medication that might work a little better. but tracking your symptoms letting us know how you feel is probably one of the most important things.	what is the drug capadex used for and what are the side effects?

this is a great question especially now because we have over-the-counter products we have vitamins we have herbals and we have prescriptions. the number one thing i tell people is number one you should have a medication list. this should be a list of all the medicines that you’re taking both prescription over-the-counter vitamins and herbals. use one pharmacy. this is very important especially nowadays. pharmacists can only see what you have filled in their store; we can’t see what you get filled at maybe the three other pharmacies that you go to. if at any time you have any questions about “am i taking too many medications” talk to your pharmacist. we will actually look at the list that you’re on.	how can i make sure that i’m not taking too many medications?
hi. i appreciate your answers but just looked this up and its totally different. the pain is more in my head and lasts a lot longer then 2 mins. even the slightest bit of alcohol triggers it. i have also had this tenderness to all of the places mentioned as if it is bruised although there is no bruise and i have not injured my head at all.

yes you will have a normal puberty and you are most likely producing sperm. since you are not planning on having a family right now it may not be that critical that you have that information but if you want. get a semen sample and look under the microscope or you can ask your doctor to order a semen analysis. you are probably worrying unnecessarily. i would bet you are just fine.	can i go through puberty without one testicle. i am 14 and have pubic hair how do i know if i produce sperm or not
i have no way of diagnosing the type of mouth sores that you have but clotrimazole lozenges would only be helpful for yeast (thrush). they would not have any effect on canker sores (aphthous ulcers) or other lesions. most recurrent mouth lesions are aphthous ulcers.	bothered about 3-4 years with sores in mouth. doctors have given me clotrimazole lozenges to dissolve. not cancer. comes and goes. dont know what is wrong. want to get rid of this for good

two things. once you have shingles (herpes zoster) you will always have it. the body's immune system will usually suppress it and keep in from breaking out but it will still be there. you will always have the potential for a recurrent outbreak but about half of the people will never see it again. shingles in not treated with antibiotics. it is a virus and viruses are immune to all antibiotics.	already had shingles can i get them again? . i was 19 yrs old when i first got shingles and became very sick from the antibiotics i was given for them. i am 37 now and because i was so young when i first got them i now wonder if i will get them again or is it like the chicken pox where once you get them you dont have to worry?

"poison ivy is a common cause of contact dermatitis an allergic reaction to something that comes in direct contact with the skin. this condition can be quite unpleasant but does not pose serious health risks. prevention is better than treatment but can be hard to achieve. poison ivy is one of many plants that produce a resin called an urushiol that can cause an allergic rash. related plants include the familiar poison oak and sumac which are found in different geographical distributions. (poison ivy is more common in the eastern u. s. and poison oak in the southeast). the rashes that each of these plants produce have a similar appearance. in addition the same urushiols are also found in the mango cashew and gingko trees. in the case of mangos peeling the fruit prevents dermatitis. people who press the whole fruit including the rind against their skin can develop a severe reaction around the mouth. those downwind from burning vegetation containing one of the offending plants can also develop widespread allergic reactions. identifying poison ivy although it is often recommended that people learn to recognize the poison ivy plant (""leaves of three leave them be"") in practice this is hard to do since poison ivy and its relatives are often mixed in with other vegetation and not noticed until after the rash has begun. keeping the skin covered in situations in which exposure is hard to avoid is the best way to prevent the problem. more than half the population can react to the poison ivy resin if they are exposed to it."	what causes the poison ivy rash?

"there is research that shows that barbecuing can be hazardous to your health. but don't worry there is still a way to have your ""barbecued steak"" and eat it too. the health problem lies in the meat. research has discovered two cancer-causing (carcinogenic) byproducts associated with barbecuing red meat poultry lamb pork and fish. the first is a carcinogen called heterocyclic amines (hcas). the national institute of health department of health and human services included hcas on its reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen list. hcas are formed due to the high temperatures occurring when meat is overcooked or char-grilled. studies have shown that when hcas were fed in the diet rodents developed cancers in many organs including the colon breast and prostate. research is still underway to determine if this applies to humans as well. the second carcinogen associated with barbecuing is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). they are formed when fat drips onto the coal or hot surface. the smoke carries the pahs to the food. they can also form directly on the food when it is charred. the recipe for healthy barbecuing is to follow some simple tips: don't get too hot: try to avoid overcooking food by precooking it in the microwave or oven so it won't be on the barbecue as long; keep the heat down on the grill and flip the food frequently to prevent overcooking on one side; buy thinner cuts of meat so that they don't take as long to cook; and test the meat with a thermometer to see when it's ready. the usda recommended safe minimum internal temperatures are: steaks & roasts - 145 degrees f fish -- 145 degrees f. pork -- 160 degrees f. ground beef -- 160 degrees f. chicken breasts -- 165 degrees f. whole poultry -- 165 degrees f. trim the fat: go for leaner cuts of meat; cut as much fat off of the meat when possible; and flip your food instead of stabbing it with a fork to avoid the fat dripping onto the coal. take time to marinate: some research has shown the ingredients (especially vinegar) in marinades act can actually protect the meat and reduce the chances of carcinogenic compounds forming. one study found that a beef steak marinated with teriyaki sauce had a 45% and 67% lower hca level at 10 minutes than the unmarinated steak and that lower levels of hca were also observed in meat marinated with turmeric-garlic sauce. keep it clean: keep the oil and grease off your grill by turning up the heat to high and closing the lid for about 10 minutes."	what are potential health problems that can be connected to eating barbecued and smoked meats?

well unless you live in one of the states that permits the use of medical marijuana (and you have a valid prescription for it) then the law says you shouldn't be using it at all. but let's assume you do have a medical marijuana prescription. in general i wouldn't think smoking cannabis would interfere with the action of prednisone. prednisone is a steroid preparation that treats inflammatory conditions. i must add however that few studies have been done to evaluate potential drug interactions with marijuana. so the real answer to your question is: we just don't know if using marijuana while taking prednisone is harmful or not. hope that helps!	is it harmful to use cannabis while taking prednisone?

you probably don't want to drop your employer's insurance. if your portion of the premium doesn't cost more than 9. 5% of your income you won't be eligible for a subsidy if you buy insurance on the marketplace. if you haven't already received a letter from your employer explaining that its health plan is considered affordable under the aca ask at work to make sure. you'll need to look for a plan for your parents separately on the marketplace. they may qualify for a subsidy. i would consult with one of the helpers available by phone at healthcare. gov.	i have employer insurance which includes my wife. . can i do away with that and apply on the marketplace and include my parents who are under 65 and do not qualify for medicare or medicaid (florida) and are dependent on me as they had no income in 2013?
yes they can. so it is very important that you always check with your health-care provider or pharmacist before taking anything new. make sure you list any vitamins you take on your personal medication list. this list should be with you at all times and you should show it to your pharmacist every time you pick up medication. if you have any questions about drug interactions get to know your pharmacist. you will be glad you did!	can vitamins interfere with any prescription medications?

taken together the viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fevers are distributed over much of the globe. however because each virus is associated with one or more particular host species the virus and the disease it causes are usually seen only where the host species live(s). some hosts such as the rodent species carrying several of the new world arenaviruses live in geographically restricted areas. therefore the risk of getting vhfs caused by these viruses is restricted to those areas. other hosts range over continents such as the rodents that carry viruses which cause various forms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in north and south america or the different set of rodents that carry viruses which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in europe and asia. a few hosts are distributed nearly worldwide such as the common rat. it can carry seoul virus a cause of hfrs; therefore humans can get hfrs anywhere where the common rat is found. while people usually become infected only in areas where the host lives occasionally people become infected by a host that has been exported from its native habitat. for example the first outbreaks of marburg hemorrhagic fever in marburg and frankfurt germany and in yugoslavia occurred when laboratory workers handled imported monkeys infected with marburg virus. occasionally a person becomes infected in an area where the virus occurs naturally and then travels elsewhere. if the virus is a type that can be transmitted further by person-to-person contact the traveler could infect other people. because more and more people travel each year outbreaks of these diseases are becoming an increasing threat in places where they rarely if ever have been seen before.	where are cases of viral hemorrhagic fever found?
medicines all do very different things and all have their own side effects. i would hope your doctor is not sending you the message that they are arbitrarily interchangeable. he or she should be telling you the pros and cons of each (what specific benefits if any can be expected from each) as they pertain to your specific symptoms and problems. it's not the patient's job to tell the surgeon what kind of sutures the surgeon should use.	i am afraid of medication side effects so my doctor gave me a list of drugs to look up and choose from. is this ok?
choosing a treatment option involves the patient his family and one or more doctors. they will need to consider the grade and stage of the cancer the man's age and health and his values and feelings about the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option. since both surgery and radiation therapy are options for localized disease consultation with both a urologist and a radiation oncologist is recommended. often it is useful to seek additional opinions -- from the same type of doctor an internist a family practice physician or a medical oncologist. because there are several reasonable options for most patients patients may hear different opinions and recommendations and the decision can be difficult. however patients should try to get as much information as possible and allow themselves enough time to make a decision. there is rarely a need to make a decision without taking time to discuss and understand the pros and cons of the various approaches.	how do i choose the best treatment for localized prostate cancer?

if they have some leftover darvocet i would not recommend taking that. we also want to make sure that people understand that they should not be saving medications and keeping them in their cabinets for a rainy day. they need to dispose off them so therefore there is no risk of possible poisonings or teen drug abuse. so one of the things we recommend now is disposing of your medications but not flushing them down the toilet. there is a new procedure that's very easy to follow and all it requires is a ziploc bag. get a ziploc bag and pour the medication into it. put a little water into it to help it dissolve. you may want to crush it; take a hammer or a mallet and actually make sure it dissolves even more. then take something like kitty litter or coffee grinds or sawdust and put it in the bag to make it very unattractive. zip up the bag and put it in the trash it's that easy. why is it so important that we want to get rid of our medications? because unfortunately today teen drug abuse has really become a big problem especially in pain medications. we find out that teens are going to their medicine cabinets right in their house and taking extra medications that were not used anymore.	i have some leftover darvocet. is it safe to take that at my next schedule dosing time?

it would be highly unlikely unless the tubal ligation surgery was blotched or the tubes magically re-attached that you would be pregnant. many hormonal conditions can mimic certain pregnancy symptoms but it would be wise for you to see your women's health specialist so you can be properly examined and diagnosed. wow! you just told my story<positive_smiley> i had my tubes tied 17yrs ago. i had 4 other children at the time and my new boyfriend didn't think he could have children! wrong! i started feeling sick tired moody but i was having my period on time every month. i thought i had a tumor cuz when i laid on my back i could feel a large hard mass in my tummy. i decided to go see my doctor ( same dr. that did tubal) i was 5 months pregnant<positive_smiley> i had no idea! it was nothing like my other 4 pregnancies. the explanation the doctor gave was. i didn't wait the suggested 2 weeks to have sex ( only 9 days) and the tubes were soft and swollen so the egg slipped through. i don't know if that was possible or if he was just covering his bootie! but i have a beautiful 16 yr old daughter<positive_smiley> but now at 43 i'm having all the classic signs of being pregnant again!	could i be pregnant after 5 months of a tubal ligation. first i want say i fell in that 1% category with my last child in 2011 with the ten year copper iud. i had my tubes tied 09/2013 i have been experiencing nauseous fatigue lastnite i noticed my breast swollen and real full as if a was getting ready to breast feed. my lmp was 1/25/2013 the breast is what has me questioning myself. my usual signs of starting my period is just bloating that's it. i'm 35 and have five children so i would know my body.

"there are no differences in the smell of anyone of a different race. skin color does not have an odor. that is not to say that humans do not have their own smells. a person who eats different or aromatic foods or spices can smell different to someone who is not familiar with the smell. a person who smokes smells quite different to a non-smoker. a person who is not diligent in their personal hygiene practices can have all sorts of body odors. i have set with plenty of them on a crowded plane. there may be a smell of poverty when someone wants to be clean but does not have the same access to a shower or laundry facilities like you do. some people do not wear deodorant or use cologne. some use too much and make my eyes water. smells are in the nose of the beholder. to say that a black person smells different than any other race can be considered a racist statement. one that has absolutely no speck of truth. racial differences usually result from genetic adaptations to climate. dark skin is protected from sunburn but absorbs more heat produces more sweat. blacks sweat more than whites. as sweat evaporates it cools. good. but. sweat carries with it many organic and inorganic compounds pretty much same as in urine which beneficial bacteria on the skin consume and ""poop"" on the skin. blacks wind up with more pee and bacteria poop it is that which does not smell good on the skin. a lot of it is not ""stink"" ""per se"" all races have a unique smell generally we each like ""our own"" think ""different"" is unpleasant. not really."	why do black people have a different smell?

just pick him up. he may need a bit of extra affection that he is not getting in day-care. when you are holding him he feels that you will not go away. after a few minutes just put him down and play with him as a distraction. this will eventually stop. you don't see parents carrying older kids around in most cases.

some women who undergo an aggressive exercise program will have a missed or delayed period. you are on an effective birth control pill so the chance of you getting pregnant is remote. but unfortunately not zero. you can take a pregnancy test but it is a bit early. in retrospect it is much easier to use condoms (protects against stds too) than to have this unnecessary worry.	i take junel fe almost every day. had unprotected sex once i started placebos havent gotten period in 5 days since. cervix is relatively high and hard. i also have excersized for the past 36 days straight (elliptical and tredmill 1 hour) i also added weight training this month. could i be pregnant? i have no symptoms of pregnancy other than missed period
i am assuming you had a middle ear infection (there are different types). not a common problem for a 40 year old but happens nonetheless. fluid can be from a few different sources. middle ear infections can sometimes cause the eardrum to break/rupture. small ruptures could create a leak and large ruptures can cause a flood of fluid usually accompanied by blood. fluid can also be caused by water in the ear canal perhaps trapped behind a little wax dam. when you lie down more heat is created in the ear canal and these little dams can break causing this trapped water to come out on your pillow or show in your outer ear. it can be yellow (wax-stained) or clear. q-tip users tend to create a lot of these wax dams. neither one of these conditions is considered serious even a tiny rupture. most will heal in a few weeks. you can see your medical provider to be properly examined and to make sure the infection has resolved. many times the source of this fluid may not be obvious since the dam may have broken and the eardrum may have healed. assuming you are not having ear pain or signs of infection you could wait it out a bit longer. or see your doctor. since you are six weeks after your infection it may be best to be examined.	"i was diagnosed with an ear infection sept 4th. i still have fluid ""trickle"" from my ears at night. do i need to go back. i finished all of my antibiotics. it took at least a week for my ear to ""unplug"". i am 40 years old. my ear doesn't hurt very much anymore - but i'm still feeling the fluid trickling out when i'm asleep. wasn't sure if this was normal or if i need to go back and have it looked at again. it's been 6 weeks. thanks!"

hello thanks for submitting your question here. as per the description you have undergone repeated surgery for ovarian torsion where the ovary is preserved. this sounds a bit different as in torsion it is a dictum to remove the whole ovary. now as you are having recurrent pain from the ovaries you need an obg consultation right now. there may be possibility of endometriosis which might present with similar feature. you need to have the biopsy of previous operation and only after few blood tests and clinical examination; a definite opinion can be formed. sincerely dr bhattacharyya	"hello- i am a 24 year old female 5""4 & 115 lb & was diagnosed with pcos at 19. i've always been active & extremely healthy. spironolactone & an iud helped with acne & pain but in 2013 i had an ovarian torsion requiring surgery & they saved my right ovary. i began having hair loss from telogen effogen & reoccurant yeast infections- i was diagnosed as pre-diabetic & cut sugar our from my already low sugar diet. fast forward to january of this year i went to the er due to pain from another torsion on the right side & again the ovary was saved. i was put on ortho tricyclen lo & still have my iud & take the spironolactone but had horribly painful cysts last month which brought me to the er but with no torsion they did nothing. the pain has been intermitten since & is getting more severe. it feels like ice cubes in my ovaries & warm water/electic shocks down my thighs. i had the hpv vaccine but my last pap showed up irregular & the biopsy of cysts got lost. any thoughts on what happening?"

assuming you adhere to the proper doses these two medications are compatible. please be advised that children can have a paradoxical effect with benadryl. in other words an antihistamine like benadryl that would make you sleepy can make a two year old hyper and more active! this may not be desirable at bedtime. don't forget that saline nose drops or sprays and the use of a cool mist humidifier at bedtime is also very helpful for colds.	can i give my 2 year old hylands baby cough syrup and then bynadryl a few hours later for her runny nose and sneezing?

i had hot grease pop and burn my stomach last year. it hurt really bad and made a nasty blister that was quite red for some time. i went to the local pharmacy and they recommended using a silver ointment (can't remember the name of it) until the blister healed. after that my nutritionist told me to use a cream she'd given me to use after a surgery i had for melanoma. i had a huge ugly scar on my shoulder blade at base of my neck. i used the cream a couple times a day for a while (several weeks). i still apply it occasionally. if you could see the huge incision i had and the terrible looking scar that was forming you'd be amazed at how good it looks now. most people don't even know it's there unless i point it out. anyway i decided that if it worked that good on my terrible surgery scar i'd try it on my stomach where i had the burn. you can't even see where the burn was now. it might be worth trying. i am sorry i've never used the no scars cream you mentioned so not sure how that one works. i can give you the name of the one i used and you can look it up online and see what the ingredients are and compare. it's called edap and the company is vitaminerals inc. you can't get it in stores so you would have to order online or find a doctor who carries it. doesn't require prescription but they don't sell it in stores. good luck. hope you are able to find something that works for you.	i'm using no scars(hydroquinone tretinoin mometasone) for burn mark will it work and how much time will it take to fade? . hello doctor . i accidentally burnt my face with hot iron one month back initially it developed a brown dry patch which after some time i removed till that stage new skin came and there was no scar however after few days a brown scar is developed on that area. now i have been using no scars cream (hydroquinone trtinoin mometasone) for 2 days. i want to ask if it is safe to use and will it give results?

yes you should experience pregnancy. here's one method that may satisfy your curiosity: contract with a hypnotherapist (preferably one who has been pregnant). although it won't be exactly like being pregnant with a competent and open-minded therapist you should be able to simulate the pregnancy experience in a realistic fashion. a possible post hypnotic suggestion might even permit you to remember and to relive the feeling of being pregnant whenever desired. for perhaps a fee of $200. 00 i say that you should live your dream.	i am man is it possible for me to treat my body like its going through pregnancy i want to find out how that feels like? . hello i being loving seeing the beautiful and sexy body of a pregnant woman and i all ways want to know what it feels like to be pregnant and i like to do stuff to my body to see i can experience what a pregnant woman goes through during pregnancy

hi the penicillin could have upset your vaginal natural balance it will do that because of this you may now have bv (bacterial vaginosis) its just one of these things some women can get can be just the once or can keep re-occurring. so its either of to your doctor for a test and meds or an std/gum clinic they will do the same thing your ok its not an std but the clinic will help you. or you can google bv and sea salt bv and boric acid bv and garlic these are just some ways you can find natural help. now it could be this that’s chucking the rest of your body out of sync and giving you the tiredness. as for your miscarriage perhaps a d&c would have helped but you could still have it done now try seeing a doctor or going to a baby clinic that has a doctor there. do hope this helps. good luck	bad smelling discharge. urine very bad smelling and dark. headaches no balance sleeping alot/tired no energy. i took 1500 mg of penicillin a day for 10 days. most symptoms went away. now have mild oder and pasty discharge. i miscarried about a yr ago and didn't seek any medical care. could something be wrong due to the miscarriage?

"the good news is: probably not. the dtap vaccine (which includes dipetheria tetanus and pertussis) is considered protective for 10 years. we recommend everyone get re-vaccinated with dtap every decade. that said the only way to tell for sure you're protected (because not all vaccines ""take"" the way they're supposed to) is to look at your blood antibodies. if your blood contains antibodies toward tetanus then you're golden. bottom line: your best bet is to consult a health care provider. even if you're up to date on your tetanus vaccination that wound could get infected with bacteria which could cause problems. better to have it looked at and washed out if necessary. hope this helps!"	i had a dtap in 2011 and i stepped on a nail today. do i need to get a tetanus shot? . im 16
an ear infection is usually limited to the ear. you may have a runny nose & nasal congestion with it but it should go away within 10 days. if it is viral antibiotics are not needed; if it is bacterial antibiotics will help. since you have additional symptoms and it has been going on for 2 weeks it is important you see a doctor. flushing and chest tightness is not a part of an ear infection so see your doctor so she can examine you to find out why this is happening.	can a ear infection cause my face to start flushing? . after getting over a coldish sinus thing my face started flushing. it happens while im just sitting at my desk not doing much. it happens everyday and can last a few minutes or sometimes for like a hour. this has been going on for about 2 weeks now and now im back to having some sort of sinus thing. i dont have any nasal congestion but i has sinus pressure post nasal drip and now my chest feels tight like its also congested.
this can be a very complex question since i do not know anything about you and there are no universal easy answers. a woman's inability to climax during sexual activity can be due to many many reasons -- from medical causes to complex psychological reasons and/or a combination of both. i would strongly suggest that you see or consult an ob/gyn to start the evaluation process	i have been sexually active for three years. he can cum but i cannot seem to cum why is that?

"many factors must be considered before starting your exercise program… your overall health including cardiac and lung functioning to name a couple. your knee replacement is also a relevant factor in determining exercise suitability. for example my wife is being treated for congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. she is also looking to lose some weight and had a full knee replacement done in june 2013. her orthopedic surgeon recently ordered more physical therapy in response to knee pain and some range of motion limitations. after you are cleared medically perhaps a licensed physical therapist could customize an exercise program that would address your knee replacement specifically. the up side of this plan is that your knee will be strengthened and your body as a whole will benefit. additionally the physical therapist will act as a cheerleader to support your exercise goals. any exercise directed at the knee should be a justifiable as a billable treatment in the eyes of most insurance companies. my wife is riding a stationary bicycle doing knee squats has weights wrapped around her knee area while elevating the leg and walking using the parallel bar platform. these exercise techniques can also be employed at home with the number of repetitions and endurance being gradually increased. swimming is also a great exercise that should not have negative consequences in response to your knee replacement. these are my recommendations <negative_smiley> 1) discuss your weight loss desire with your family doctor. perhaps he or she will recommend a great diet to kick start your weight loss program and clear you medically for an exercise program (2) phone your orthopedist and ask for a physical therapy referral to strengthen your knee (3) call your medical insurance provider to find an approved physical therapy company in your living area. the process of losing weight after knee replacement is an obtainable goal through diet and exercise. your success will probably be measured in small incremental steps. remember as a chinese proverb states “a long journey starts with the first step.

dermal fillers are generally used to fix those nose to mouth lines. that would be from here to here and those are call nasolabial folds. what i found though sometimes is that some people ask for fillers in this area but they have really lost volumes in the temples or in other areas in the face and putting too much filler in that area can create too much fullness without making them look younger and it doesn't always look natural. so you need to have a conversation with your dermatologist about what your concerns are and they can point out to you ways in which you can soften your overall expression in a very natural way. by volumizing the skin and the face in a way that has balance and harmony. because we have so many new products to use between sculptra and hyaluronic acids and radiesse and evolence we have really great products to use and sometimes we use more than one product in the same person in order to achieve that overall natural result. but this is a complete conversation that you need to have with your aesthetic physician which would be dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see what the right treatment is for you.	i have nose to mouth lines. will dermal fillers fix these lines and how much does it cost?
"i have a ba in psychology and also suffer from bipolar disorder. i was a major control freak and to a much lesser degree still am. your future daughter-in-law needs to seek help immediately. she is suffering from bipolar disorder with psychosis (because she is hearing things that have not been said) and this is a very serious situation. she is out of control and needs help to get stabilized as soon as possible and stay on the meds even after she feels better. a lot of bipolar people stop taking their meds once they feel better and it is very dangerous because some meds need to be reduced slowly or a deadly rash can start or other various withdrawal symptoms. she will most likely balk at the idea at her having any kind of problem or seeking help so good luck and i sincerely hope she sees that what she needs is help from a professional. my epiphany came to me when i was having a fight with my former fiancé and as he is throwing me down on the gravel road and into the ditch i thought to myself: this is not how ""normal"" people behave. this can't be how ""normal"" people feel every day. so when i went back to my parent's house i told my mother that i was ready to go get help. it was like i was on the outside looking at myself doing all these things wanting to shake myself and scream ""stop it"" like an out of body experience sort of. i wish you and your son well. he must be prepared that even if she does get help it's hit and miss on the medications until they find the right one(s) for her but the road may always be bumpy."	is manipulation and trying to control someone else's life a part of bi polar? . my son's fiance is bipolar her mood swings are total caious. she constantly wants to argue she misinterpruts everything and she also hears things that haven't even been said. the worst part is she believes it to be true. my son will do anything for her. she cuts up his clothing and throws him out last week she made an sos call that she was going to hang herself. my son raced 20km on his bike as he was at a friends at the time to find her just fine and she threw him back out.
figuring out which insurance plan will best meet your health needs for the coming year is far from simple. if you get your insurance through an employer you’ll likely be given a few plan options from which to choose. if you buy insurance in the private market you can search for plans available in your area and compare the benefits side-by-side at either healthcare. gov or ehealthinsurance. com. when evaluating each plan take the following factors into consideration: do the math: estimating what your out-of-pocket costs will be over the course of the next year is one of the most important considerations when choosing a health plan. that means calculating the cost of items such as expected deductibles co-pays co-insurance and prescriptions. once you’ve added the numbers ask yourself: is it cheaper to purchase a high deductible plan with a lower monthly premium that costs me more before benefits kick in? or do i see a doctor frequently enough to make it worth my while to pay more each month for a plan that covers costs right away for each doctor visit or treatment? also factor in your worst-case scenario. what will your maximum financial exposure be if you get sick and need serious medical care? most insurers offer plan-modeling tools on their web site to help you factor in how many times you typically see a doctor during the year how many prescriptions you take and whether you’re planning a surgery to help you figure out what your total out-of-pocket costs might be and which plan options might best serve you. review covered services: if you’re planning to become pregnant and your plan doesn’t cover maternity care (a common situation in the private market) you’ll be left with a hefty bill upon baby’s arrival. carefully check out the list of excluded benefits in the health-plan summary. if in doubt call the insurance company directly to confirm that the type of care and services you require are covered under the plan you’re considering. provider networks and drug formularies: is your doctor in the network? are the three medications you take each month listed in the health plan’s formulary? if not you’re in for sticker shock. provider network and drug formulary information should be listed in the summary plan description or you can check the insurer’s web site for that information. if you’re searching for insurance on your own ehealthinsurance. com offers an option whereby you can type in your doctor’s name to see if she or he is in a health plan’s network. you might also want to call your doctor(s) directly to confirm participation.	how do i sort through all the different health insurance plans to find the one best for me?

this. is common but also something that can be worked around. some men find that it helps to ask their partner to put the condom on their penis so that they can continue touching and kissing and looking at their partner which can help to maintain their arousal. applying water-based lubricant or silicone-based lubricant to the outside of the condom (once it's on the penis) can help too as the slippery motion of her or your hand massaging your condom-covered penis can feel arousing and enhanced your erection. make sure too that you are using a condom that fits your penis comfortably. if you need a bigger or smaller size ask your pharmacist for recommendations or browse options [online].	how do i prevent going soft when i put on a condom?

could be nothing: a blocked pore or something. or it could be something: genital lesions can be signs of a sexually transmitted disease or another condition. i'd suggest you have this looked at by a medical provider. by the way it's rarely a good idea to squeeze or pop any sort of skin lesion. when you do that you create a hole in the skin that can allow infectious bacteria to enter. you especially don't want that to happen on your penis. all the best to you!	spot in genital area. ive had fordyce spots for as long as i can remember on penis. there was a spot on the upper shaft that seemed possibly larger than normal but still looked like a fordyce spot. i attempted popping it and a small white substance came out. sort of like after popping a pimple it wasnt stringy though just like a white formed substance. theres been no irritation or redness bump is still there but not as raised.

"do you wonder whether disposable incontinence supplies are cheaper in the long run than reusable types? do you worry about putting all of those disposable items into the environment? if you are using incontinence products of any kind (pads adult diapers undergarments etc. ) you need to evaluate the types of products available based on what is most important to you — convenience or economy. there is no research to tell you which type of product is better for the skin. disposable products are convenient. purchased in quantity they can be always available when needed and require no labor other than putting them on. underwear and pads come in a wide range of sizes (waist extenders are available for some briefs) and they all are available in light medium and heavy protection levels. disposable incontinence products are more expensive than washable products in general and can cost anywhere from $200 to $400 per month depending on the amount of urine loss. this is a large expense for a person on a fixed income. some people are forced to make their own homemade pads from tissue paper towels and other materials. unfortunately medicare hmos and insurance companies don't tend to cover the cost of absorbent products and their disposal adds to environmental pollution. at the same time reusable products may not be as ""skin friendly"" as disposable ones. washable/reusable products are economical. studies have shown that some washable pads are equivalent in cost to 100 disposable pads of the same absorbency. washable underwear is available in basic styles in styles that mimic regular underwear and in styles that are elegant and indistinguishable from fine lingerie. if you are caring for someone who needs many underwear or pad changes daily the labor of washing these products is a factor to consider. incontinence garments (sometimes called adult diapers) that are washable usually have an outer layer of plastic rubber or synthetic material for protection and can be pulled up snapped on the side or open down the front. they are usually less expensive to use over time than disposable garments. because of their waterproof outer layer many women find washable garments uncomfortable because they don't ""breathe"". such women often prefer cotton underwear with a perineal pad in the crotch to collect urine leakage."	how should i choose incontinence products?
even in people with chronic hepatitis b the immune system is working to suppress the virus. medications that suppress the immune system allow the virus to reproduce in large numbers and may cause the hepatitis to flare. examples of medications that suppress the immune system are: prednisone: used to treat many diseases including asthma inflammatory bowel disease and certain types of skin disease and arthritis. methotrexate (rheumatrex trexall): used to treat certain types of skin disease arthritis and cancer. cyclophosphamide (cytoxan): used to treat some cancers. if an immunosuppressant drug is stopped the body's immune system's activity may rebound and cause severe inflammation of the liver.	what are the effects of immunosuppressive medications on hepatitis b virus?

"" follow these steps: go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time each morning use the bed only for sleeping not for watching tv reading or any other activity (except sex) try meditating for a few minutes in the evening to calm your mind do not watch tv or use a computer or cell phone within two hours of your bedtime; these devices emit a spectrum of light that suppresses the body's production of sleep hormones like melatonin do not eat or drink for a couple of hours before bed take a warm bath or engage in some other relaxing activity before bed keep your bedroom cool dark and quiet if you follow these routines for a few weeks and you find you still can't sleep then it may be time to consult a doctor. there are over-the-counter sleep aids you an take but most people do best by maintaining a good sleep routine. wishing you well!"	sleeping difficulty due to non stop brain activity. for a few days i've been unable to sleep at night. every time i try my head is overloaded with random sounds and images. i sleep in small starts and i have a mild throbbing headache within a few hours. this started after a day of high tension but my lack of sleep is making my morning life worse.

gripe water is something that i would consider more of a home remedy. it was around for sometime and believe it or not the formula has changed over the years. it has been used to treat colic or gassy babies but it is over-the-counter and it's not really well-known whether or not it works. there were no studies done there is no advocacy studies done either. my concern as a pharmacist is that it does can sometimes contain things like alcohol it contains dill oil sodium bicarbonate sugars this could cause the baby may be to become a little more cranky. actually if i think about sugar a little more hyper may be not sleeping as well. so to be honest with you as a pharmacist my recommendation would probably be to not use it or also talk to your pediatrician and find out that something they really want you to be using with the baby.	what is gripe water?

an expectorant causes you to cough. i am sure that your two-year old is doing just fine in that department. coughing is important because it helps your child clear her airway. an expectorant will only increase the amount of mucous that she will need to clear and she is unable to spit it out. this may cause her to vomit. personally i would not recommend that you use it unless her doctor specifically okayed it.	my 2 yr old is on amoxicillin for pneumonia (starting ) can i give her a cough syrup from gaiakids (natural expectorant. the cough syrup is all natural - purchased at whole foods.
your doctor is being thorough. trying to give you a more definite answer based on the results of both tests. there is always a cause to be concerned so your doctor is trying to alleviate any diagnostic uncertainty. as a breast cancer survivor i can share what i've learned from my experiences. i am not a medical professional i can only give my opinions. mammograms do not always detect everything but they have a very important role to play in diagnostics. dense breast tissue most often will obscure many things during mammography therefore many doctors will order an ultrasound or mri. each of these diagnostic tools have unique strengths that play vital roles in proper diagnoses. it seems you are in great hands and that your doctor is doing everything possible to rule everything out without causing delay which would only increase your anxiety. i believe in prevention in all things. i believe in early detection saves lives. most lesions turn out to be cysts. however should a different type of lesion be found the sooner the better. if it should turn out to be cancerous the earlier it is found diagnosed and treated then better the outcome. also the earlier a tumor is diagnosed the easier the treatment. mammograms do save lives! i found my tumor myself through self-exam. i have a very aggressive form of breast cancer which grows very quickly so the lump formed and grew large quickly between my annual mammograms. my diagnosis triggered my sister getting her first mammogram through which two tumors were found. mammography saved her life! mammography also brings relief and joy! two days ago i underwent my latest mammogram and two years post diagnosis i am cancer free!	i am 34 years old my doctor has confirmed breast nodules. should i worry that my dr. ordered both a mamm and ultrasound? . i have been told the ultrasound is usually ordered based on the mammogram results. i wondered if it was cause for concern that he was shotgunning them both at once same day one after the other.

first it’s good to be concerned and thoughtful about how you will please your partner – just don’t get too worried about it; approaching it with relaxation and ease is more productive for you. second try practicing edging for a couple of weeks. edging involves masturbating right up until the point of ejaculating then stopping before the ejaculation occurs; letting the urge to ejaculate subside; then masturbating to the edge again; and repeating this over and over without ejaculating for as long as you can – at least half an hour. doing this every day for 2-3 weeks helps many men learn control over their ejaculations when with a partner. it also gives them a sore red penis but using a quality penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) that includes both vitamin e (a natural hydrator) and she abutter (an excellent emollient) can help reduce the soreness.	i ejaculation in 2-3 mins is it normal? please advice some useful tips n med if nessesary. i am getting married soon and i found when i masturbate i become excited to much and cum in no time please tell me how to increase time for intercourse? exercise medicine diet all guide will be appreciated.
"osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis that is caused by the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints. cartilage is a protein substance that serves as a ""cushion"" between the bones of the joints. osteoarthritis is also known as degenerative arthritis. among the over 100 different types of arthritis conditions osteoarthritis is the most common affecting over 20 million people in the united states. osteoarthritis occurs more frequently as we age. before age 45 osteoarthritis occurs more frequently in males. after 55 years of age it occurs more frequently in females. in the united states all races appear equally affected. a higher incidence of osteoarthritis exists in the japanese population while south-african blacks east indians and southern chinese have lower rates. osteoarthritis commonly affects the hands feet spine and large weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees. most cases of osteoarthritis have no known cause and are referred to as primary osteoarthritis. when the cause of the osteoarthritis is known the condition is referred to as secondary osteoarthritis. osteoarthritis is sometimes abbreviated oa."	what is osteoarthritis?

it's entirely possible to have multiple infections at the same time but your doctor is right antibiotics should clear any bacterial infections right up. the sore throat is likely being caused by post nasal drip from your sinus infection. if it's strep you should see small white patches on your tonsils and it's extremely painful. if after you finish your round of antibiotics you still have a serious sore throat then you should go back to the doctor for more tests. good luck!	can you have both a sinus infection and strep throat? . my doctor told me i have a severe sinus infection but could also have strep but since he treated the infection with antibotics he said there was no reason to check for strep as the treatment for strep is the same. i have a severe sore throat have a hard time swallowing have a red rash on the back of my throat and i have a fever. is it possible to have both at the same time? my sinus' were draining down the back of my throat and i didn't know it until 4 days after my sore throat started.
there can be many causes for a neuropathy. your doctor has most likely already taken a good medical history and a physical exam. many clues can be obtained with these simple tools. examination of the legs and feet will include checking your reflexes strength and sensation. depending on the results you may need an emg test and lab work. sometimes x-rays ct scans or mris may be needed of your back or brain. some of the possible causes of neuropathy besides diabetes include: vitamin b12 deficiency thyroid problems autoimmune diseases lyme disease inflamed blood vessels kidney failure alcohol abuse hiv infection and syphilis. multiple sclerosis guillain-barré syndrome and rare types of cancers may also cause neuropathy. the next step if your doctor can’t find a cause for your problem would be to see a neurologist. this is a doctor who specializes in diseases of the brain and nerves. make sure to take all your test results with you. i hope you get some answers and relief soon.	i have been diagnosed with neuropathy in my legs but am not diabetic. it is slowly progressing up my legs any ideas?

i found a little information about this online: subj: zofran date: <negative_smiley>24/2010 we have a patient who is taking zofran and came up positive on a drug test for syboxone. do you know of any reason why someone taking zofran would test positive for syboxone? tim askdocweb: we were unable to discover any reason for zofran to cause a false positive on a urine drug screen. zofran (ondansetron) is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgery. zofran is in a class of medications called 5-ht3 receptor antagonists. it works by blocking the action of serotonin a natural substance that may cause nausea and vomiting. so to me that means there might have been something else causing the false positive. could you have eaten poppy seeds for example? also he shouldn't have kicked you out of his practice without a confirmation test because those screenings are known to have a certain error rate. either call his boss and complain or get yourself a new doctor who will actually give the chance to clear yourself.	can ondansetron show up positive for thc on a drug test? . i was recently dropped from my doctor after 16 years of being a model patient. in april i took a drug test and was terminated because he said my test was bad. that's all the explanation i got. i don't do any drugs i'm not prescribed but i was given zofran (ondansetron) for nausea. i only take it a couple times a month. can this prescription in anyway make you have a bad drug test? if not and he won't tell me specifically what was wrong with my drug test. what can i do so this doesn't happen again?

untreated athlete's foot can potentially spread to other body parts or other people including family members. fungus may spread locally to the legs toenails hands fingernails and essentially any body area. this type of fungus generally likes to live in the skin hair and nails. it does not invade deep go into body organs or go into the blood system. fungal infections of the nails are called tinea unguium or onychomycosis. nail fungus may be very difficult to treat. antifungal pills may be required in cases of more advanced toenail fungal infections. fungal nail infection (onychomycosis) groin fungus (tinea cruris) body skin fungus (tinea corporis) secondary bacterial infections people with diabetes hiv/aids cancer or other immune problems may be more prone to all kinds of infections including fungus. when the skin is injured by fungus the natural protective skin barrier is broken. bacteria and yeasts can then invade the broken skin. bacteria can cause a bad smell. bacterial infection of the skin and resulting inflammation is known as cellulitis. this is especially likely to occur those individuals with diabetes chronic leg swelling who have had veins removed (such as for heart bypass surgery) or in the elderly. bacterial skin infections also occur more frequently in patients with impaired immune systems.	what are possible complications of athlete's foot?
although most people with epilepsy lead full active lives they are at special risk for two life-threatening conditions: status epilepticus and sudden unexplained death. status epilepticus status epilepticus is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a person either has an abnormally prolonged seizure or does not fully regain consciousness between seizures. although there is no strict definition for the time at which a seizure turns into status epilepticus most people agree that any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes should for practical purposes be treated as though it was status epilepticus. status epilepticus affects about 195 000 people each year in the united states and results in about 42 000 deaths. while people with epilepsy are at an increased risk for status epilepticus about 60 percent of people who develop this condition have no previous seizure history. these cases often result from tumors trauma or other problems that affect the brain and may themselves be life-threatening. while most seizures do not require emergency medical treatment someone with a prolonged seizure lasting more than 5 minutes may be in status epilepticus and should be taken to an emergency room immediately. it is important to treat a person with status epilepticus as soon as possible. one study showed that 80 percent of people in status epilepticus who received medication within 30 minutes of seizure onset eventually stopped having seizures whereas only 40 percent recovered if 2 hours had passed before they received medication. doctors in a hospital setting can treat status epilepticus with several different drugs and can undertake emergency life-saving measures such as administering oxygen if necessary. people in status epilepticus do not always have severe convulsive seizures. instead they may have repeated or prolonged nonconvulsive seizures. this type of status epilepticus may appear as a sustained episode of confusion or agitation in someone who does not ordinarily have that kind of mental impairment. while this type of episode may not seem as severe as convulsive status epilepticus it should still be treated as an emergency. sudden unexplained death for reasons that are poorly understood people with epilepsy have an increased risk of dying suddenly for no discernible reason. this condition called sudden unexplained death can occur in people without epilepsy but epilepsy increases the risk about two-fold. researchers are still unsure why sudden unexplained death occurs. one study suggested that use of more than two anticonvulsant drugs may be a risk factor. however it is not clear whether the use of multiple drugs causes the sudden death or whether people	are there special risks associated with epilepsy?

yes it is possible. endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (blood tests for diagnosing celiac disease) are highly reliable in diagnosing celiac disease. an individual with abnormally elevated endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. anti-gliadin antibodies are less reliable and have a higher rate of false positive tests. there are two recognized reasons for false negative blood tests for celiac disease: patients with deficiency of one type of antibody iga (they are born that way) will have low endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies since they are iga-type antibodies. patients who have self-treated themselves with a gluten-free diet for weeks to months before having these tests done can have abnormal blood tests revert to normal.	is it possible to have a false negative blood test for celiac disease?
i have read through your query in detail. please find my observations below. amoxicillin is still a better antibiotic for dental abscess as compared to other medicines. it is the first choice of medicine even for dental abscess. it is better to continue with amoxycillin as a treatment option for her. metronidazole or clindamycin is given only in case of severe infection. the order of preference of drugs for dental abscess in a patient is: amoxicillin erythromycin or clarithromycin or clindamycin metronidazole. ciprofloxacin is usually not given at first. she can be given amoxicillin on her next appointment as well. the above information is as per latest updates on pharmacological treatment of dental abscess. please keep in mind any allergy the patient might have to any of the medications and prescribe an alternative choice. hope this answers your question. please feel free to correct any oversight in my interpretation of your problems and discuss them in detail as per your requirements. revert back to a pharmacologist online for further follow up --> <link>	Hello doctor,I have a patient with a fresh knee replacement, and of course takes pre-medication Amoxicillin 2g, one hour pre-treatment.She now has a tooth abscess and I want to give her antibiotics.My thought is, since she has to always use Penicillin as a pre-medication, I would change the antibiotics.But she also has a colon resection and Clindamycin probably would not be a good one to use.Can I give her Ciprofloxacin?Also, on her next appointment, should she go ahead and take the 2g of Amoxicillin as usual, or Ciprofloxacin or what can be used as a pre-medication?Thank you.
"some common causes of hyperthyroidism include: graves' disease. functioning adenoma (""hot nodule"") and toxic multinodular goiter (tmng). excessive intake of thyroid hormones. abnormal secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland). excessive iodine intake. graves' disease graves' disease which is caused by a generalized overactivity of the thyroid gland is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. in this condition the thyroid gland usually is renegade which means it has lost the ability to respond to the normal control by the pituitary gland via tsh. graves' disease is hereditary and is up to five times more common among women than men. graves' disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease and antibodies that are characteristic of the illness may be found in the blood. these antibodies include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (tsi antibodies) thyroid peroxidase antibodies (tpo) and tsh receptor antibodies. graves' disease can be diagnosed by a standard nuclear medicine thyroid scan which shows diffusely increased uptake of a radioactively-labeled iodine. in addition a blood test may reveal elevated tsi levels. functioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter the thyroid gland (like many other areas of the body) becomes lumpier as we get older. in the majority of cases these lumps do not produce thyroid hormones and require no treatment. occasionally a nodule may become ""autonomous "" which means that it does not respond to pituitary regulation via tsh and produces thyroid hormones independently. this becomes more likely if the nodule is larger than 3 cm. when there is a single nodule that is independently producing thyroid hormones it is called a functioning nodule. if there is more than one functioning nodule the term toxic multinodular goiter is used. functioning nodules may be readily detected with a thyroid scan. excessive intake of thyroid hormones taking too much thyroid hormone medication is actually quite common. excessive doses of thyroid hormones frequently go undetected due to the lack of follow-up of patients taking their thyroid medicine. other persons may be abusing the drug in an attempt to achieve other goals such as weight loss. these patients can be identified by having a low uptake of radioactively-labelled iodine (radio-iodine) on a thyroid scan. abnormal secretion of tsh a tumor in the pituitary gland may produce an abnormally high secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). this leads to excessive signaling to the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. this condition is very rare and can be associated with other abnormalities of the pituitary gland. to identify this disorder an endocrinologist performs elaborate tests to assess the release of tsh. thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) inflammation of the thyroid gland may occur after a viral illness (subacute thyroiditis). this condition is associated with a fever and a sore throat that is often painful on swallowing. the thyroid gland is also tender to the touch. there may be generalized neck aches and pains. inflammation of the gland with an accumulation of white blood cells known as lymphocytes (lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also occur. thyroiditis can be diagnosed by a thyroid scan. excessive iodine intake the thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. an excess of iodine may cause hyperthyroidism. iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually seen in patients who already have an underlying abnormal thyroid gland. certain medications such as amiodarone (cordarone) which is used in the treatment of heart problems contain a large amount of iodine and may be associated with thyroid function abnormalities."	what causes hyperthyroidism?

virtually all viruses are contagious. if you are susceptible. adults tend to carry a certain level of immunity to many viruses (and there are hundreds of them) so exposure does not necessarily mean you will catch it. or even have the same viral response. respiratory viruses are usually contagious a day before you know you are sick and for two days afterward. since i do not know the bug that has plagued your other family members i can't address your issue specifically but time with family is important. and sometimes you just have to take a chance. we all take chances going out the grocery store or restaurants but we go anyway.	we are spending a weekend with family members who have just recovered from colds. are they still contagious?
good communication can prevent affairs by keeping relationships strong. it is especially important that couples share their thoughts and feelings about each other. when couples express their appreciation of each other they highlight all that feels good. by praising your partner for accomplishments or for particular characteristics (e. g. hard working benevolent) they will feel positively about themselves and you. by thanking your partner for doing something nice for you you let them know that you value them. another important part of good communication is talking about conflicts and painful feelings. people who are emotionally close are bound to step on each other’s toes sometimes. when this happens it’s important that they talk about it. this helps the ‘offended party’ by giving them an opportunity to share their experience; and hopefully feel validated and cared about by their partner’s response. it also helps the ‘offending party’ know the effect of their action; and provides an opportunity for them to offer a sincere apology sharing their deep feelings of caring. partners can also prevent affairs by proactively staying away from situations that threaten their fidelity. while conducting couple therapy over the years i’ve seen how both men and women have formed innocent friendships that eventually developed into affairs. so to prevent an affair from developing it is important that people are aware of this possibility and disconnect from (or put distance in) such relationships early on. they would also do well to think about whether there is something missing from their main relationship that leaves them vulnerable to looking elsewhere — and then to work on remedying that situation. unfortunately there is no absolutely sure way to prevent affairs or to ensure that someone you love won’t hurt you. but maintaining good communication and proactively protecting your relationship are two very good ways to nurture a happy monogamous relationship.	how can i prevent my partner from having an affair?

barium is notorious for causing constipation so i suggest that you consult your medical provider for a patient-specific treatment suggestion.	"can a small bowel series with barium swallow cause constipation? . i have been losing weight and am now approx. 20lbs under the lowest gauge for my height (5' 4""). i've had an endoscopy colonoscopy and a small bowel series with barium swallow. ever since the small bowel series i've had constipation/very little movement of the bowels. can barium cause a gastric blockage?"
routinely the root canal treatment has three steps in total. pulp extirpation. root canal preparation. root canal filling. since you have mentioned that pulp removal was done under emergency there are more chances of remnants of pulp along with bugs to be left behind in the roots inside. in your first visit most of the pulp and pus should have been removed and that is why you got no pain until now. the maximum time usually allowed to start up root canal preparation is four weeks but it does not mean that you will lose the tooth waiting long. however it is best when the treatment is finished in short time frame unless it is medicated in the case of severe infections. there are high chances of root canal treatment attempted tooth when left untreated to get broken down because of no strength and no proper protection such as a cap. hence i advise you to get your next appointment as soon as possible and go ahead with the treatment plan. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I recently had an extirpation of pulp as an emergency on one of my teeth.

laser hair removal will need to be repeated because your hair grows in different cycles. dark hair on darker skin types is particularly difficult to treat because the laser works by “distinguishing” the pigment in your hair follicle from the pigment in your skin. your dark patches can be treated with topical skin lightening agents such as hydroquinone kojic acid or bearberry derivatives.	i am a woman in my late 30s. i have undergone laser hair removal treatments for my chin. however after several treatmen. i am a woman in my late 30s. i have undergone laser hair removal treatments for my chin. however after several treatments the hair continues to grow back. i also have a dark patch because of plucking over time. are there options to lighten the skin as well as remove the hair?

we usually recommend antiepileptic if someone has two seizures within 24 hours. in approximately 70% cases we may not be able to identify any specific cause for seizures for example - infection stroke focal cortical dysplasia (fcd) and tumor as in your case. sinusitis is an incidental finding and at present it seems to be unrelated to epilepsy. you should complete antibiotic course as prescribed for its coverage. for epilepsy he will need antiepileptic drugs (aed). there are many aed to choose from but once you have been given keppra (levetiracetam) you can continue the same as it is a new generation drug with minimal side effects and drug interaction. with the limited information i have i would recommend starting it to prevent future seizures. your neurologist can provide you with its optimal dosing. high white blood cell (wbc) could be related to sinusitis or as a transient rise from seizure itself. it should come down by itself. it would be good to know how long his seizure was and what he did during his seizure. did he passed urine stool or bite his tongue during the episode? revert back with the asked details to a neurologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am writing to get a second opinion for my relative.

fillers should not be thought of as a substitute for surgery. a patient who needs a face and neck lift will have sagginess around the jowls and jaw line and a hanging neck. none of that can be improved with fillers. while surgery may be appropriate to help tighten the mid and lower face it does that only to a limited degree. overaggressive surgical treatment will result in that terrible windblown overdrawn “i-was-strapped-to-a-747? look. and that result is very difficult to undo. as fillers are not a substitute for surgery the reverse is true as well. surgery can’t take the place of fillers. but we need to be realistic about what non-surgical techniques such as fillers whether they be permanent or semi-permanent can do with respect to improving the entire appearance. remember the neck and the eyes are the areas that are the tipoffs to aging. and while fillers such as restylane juvederm hydrelle perlane zyderm zyplast cosmoderm cosmoplast sculptra radiesse and even fat and liquid silicone can do great things around the face and i certainly endorse them they don’t answer the problem of the jowls the saggy neck the hanging platysma edges the double chin and upper neck and jaw fat. only surgery is the salvation there. experienced cosmetic plastic surgeons will guide you as to the best choices or combination of treatment. as i’ve said many a time one shoe does not fit all.	can fillers replace plastic surgery?

researchers have had difficulty determining exactly what causes bacterial vaginosis. at present it seems to be that a combination of multiple bacteria must be present together for the problem to develop. bacterial vaginosis typically features a reduction in the number of the normal hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli in the vagina. simultaneously there is an increase in concentration of other types of bacteria especially anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that grow in the absence of oxygen). as a result the diagnosis and treatment are not as simple as identifying and eradicating a single type of bacteria. why the bacteria combine to cause the infection is unknown. certain factors have been identified that increase the chances of developing bacterial vaginosis. these include multiple or new sexual partners intrauterine devices for contraception recent antibiotic use vaginal douching and cigarette smoking. however the role of sexual activity in the development of the condition is not fully understood and bacterial vaginosis can still develop in women who have not had sexual intercourse.	what causes bacterial vaginosis?

several genes have now been definitively linked to parkinson's disease. the first to be identified was alpha-synuclein. in the 1990s researchers at the national institutes of health (nih) and other institutions studied the genetic profiles of a large italian family and three greek families with familial parkinson's disease and found that their disease was related to a mutation in this gene. they found a second alpha-synuclein mutation in a german family with parkinson's disease. these findings prompted studies of the role of alpha-synuclein in parkinson's disease which led to the discovery that lewy bodies from people with the sporadic form of parkinson's disease contained clumps of alpha-synuclein protein. this discovery revealed a potential link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease. researchers studying inherited parkinson's disease discovered that the disease in one large family was caused by a triplication of the normal alpha-synuclein gene on one copy of chromosome 4. this triplication caused people in the affected family to produce too much of the normal alpha-synuclein. the study showed that an excess of the normal form of the protein could result in parkinson's disease just as the abnormal form does. other genes linked to parkinson's disease include parkin dj-1 pink1 and lrrk2. parkin dj-1 and pink-1 cause rare early onset forms of parkinson's disease. the parkin gene is translated into a protein that normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins. dj-1 normally helps regulate gene activity and protect cells from oxidative stress. pink1 codes for a protein active in mitochondria. mutations in this gene appear to increase susceptibility to cellular stress. lrrk2 which is translated into a protein called dardarin was originally identified in several english and basque families and causes a late-onset form of parkinson's disease. subsequent studies have identified this gene in other families with parkinson's disease as well as in a small percentage of people with apparently sporadic parkinson's disease. researchers are continuing to investigate the normal functions and interactions of these genes in order to find clues about how parkinson's disease develops. they also have identified a number of other genes and chromosome regions that may play a role in parkinson's disease but the nature of these links is not yet clear.	what genes are linked to parkinson's disease?

hi i think the answer is no if you read this its a piece i found may help may not. good luck you can get chlamydia through: unprotected vaginal sex unprotected anal sex unprotected oral sex your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals sharing sex toys when they are not washed or covered with a new condom between each person who uses them sexual fluid from the penis or vagina can pass chlamydia from one person to another even if the penis does not enter the vagina anus or mouth. this means you can get chlamydia from genital contact with someone who has the infection even if there is no penetration orgasm or ejaculation. it isn’t clear if chlamydia could be passed on by transferring infected semen or vaginal fluid on the fingers. infected semen or vaginal fluid can cause conjunctivitis if it gets into someone’s eye.	can someone be infected with chlamydia through other things besides sex? like needles razors etc.

hi and from www. ncb. nlm. nih. gov com this its a question and answer. question many of my female patients complain about acne unwanted hair growth and other skin problems that have only developed since they became pregnant. are products used for these types of benign skin conditions safe to use in pregnancy as it is understandable that women want to look their best at this important time in their lives? answer with the exception of hydroquinone which has a relatively high systemic absorption rate and tretinoin for which the evidence is controversial these products act locally and therefore produce minimal systemic levels. consequently in most cases women can deal with these cosmetically unappealing skin conditions without compromising the safety of their unborn children. hope this helps you. good luck	is it okay to use a toning cream tthat contains 2% hydroquinone during pregnancy?

for many women even if their periods are regular you need some type of hormonal balance in order to help control the acne. i have patients who tell me that they never had acne as a teenager now they are in their 20s 30s and sometimes even 40s and all of a sudden they are starting to get acne and invariably this acne is in the lower face. not the teenage form where it's in the middle face and forehead but really along the jawline and the lower face and even along the submental along the neck and the jawline underneath a little bit as well. this acne can be very difficult to control with the treatments that we use in teenagers. so i still use antibiotics by mouth and topical treatments such as the retinoids retin-a and tazorac benzoyl peroxide things like that. but when i add an oral contraceptive or another medicine called spironolactone or aldactone; that's the same drug in the brand and generic name that often works really well to control their acne and make anything else i do work that much better. but it does need to be under the supervision of your dermatologist.	will birth control pills clear up my acne?

most helpful answer i never heard of a case where an std was contracted from a bottle of old urine. i think you are safe even if you recently had an open wound on your hand. needless to say i assume that you wash your hands thoroughly after this exposure. as long as you are not showing any signs of a skin infection around this wound you are in the clear. urine is typically sterile (unless the person has a urinary tract infection) but i still would not want to have this old pee on my hands. you are wise to be concerned but it would not be likely you can catch any disease from this exposure. even if you did get a minor wound infection it would not be an std.	can i get an std through urine contacting an open wound? . i was helping clean out a friends car and grabbed a sticky bottle of muscle milk. i went to rinse off my hand with what i thought was water but turned out to be sour urine. i had a cut on my hand from a few days before. is it possible for me to contract and sti or any other form of disease this way?
the reasons may be numerous and of course very complex and highly-individualized. this is not something that can be blindly solved over the internet. your first step is to make sure there is not something medically/physically wrong that can account for your displeasure. then you may need to see a psychologist -- someone skilled in sexual dsyfunction -- to help you sort out the possible reasons and solution to solve this very distressing dilemma.	why does sex not feel good to me? . what is wrong with me. whenever i have sex it does not feel good but it does not hurt/feel bad. it literally feels like nothing no pleasure at all. i feel him there but no pleasure with him being inside me. of course i have tried different positions and have had different partners. nothing seems to give me pleasure.

generally the older we get the fewer calories we need to stay the same weight. but age itself isn't really the issue. we tend to be less active as we get older which means we burn fewer calories. with less activity we also lose muscle. muscle burns a lot of calories throughout the day. so as we lose muscle our metabolism starts to plummet. this also subtracts from the number of calories burned during the day. so if you keep eating as much as you did before you became less active and started losing muscle mass you're most likely going to gain weight. the good news is that you can combat that weight gain by staying active as you age. i highly recommend exercise at any age. exercise is one of the most important things we can do -- especially as we get older -- to stay healthy happy and active.	do seniors need to eat fewer calories than middle-aged people?

i cannot imagine how ranitidine -- a totally different drug and drug class -- would result in a false positive test for amphetamines. most people who get positive drug tests actually took the drug and are lying about it. i am not saying that mistakes can happen but they are very rare. i truly hope that's the case. i've been clean my whole pregnancy & never touched amphetamines before. thank you for your answer! (:	can ranitidine show up as amphetamines. i was recently searching online to see if it was safe during pregnancy for heartburn. & people were talking about how it caused them to fail for anphetamines. which really worries me being almost 8 months pregnant & all.
if your husband's work-based plan doesn't provide any coverage for prescription drugs it may not meet the standards under the law. i suggest you check with his employer to find out if it meets the aca's requirements. if it doesn't there is a possibility you can qualify for a tax credit to help lower the cost of insurance you buy through the marketplace. in most cases employer-based insurance is the best deal around even when it's pricey. still even if you don't qualify for a tax credit it may be worth shopping all of your options to see if you can find a plan at a cost you can cover.	my husband was diagnosed with metabolic disorder and high blood pressure. . his employer pays $200 toward his health insurance costs of $800/month. he is 62. we just can't afford these rates any longer plus co-pays etc. no prescription coverage. we pray he will qualify for new insurance. we lost our business 4 years ago and are building a new career. we are trying to hold on to our home. i am disabled and receive disability.
"loss of firmness is a common concern in aging skin. skin experts have long known that the loss of skin's firmness is a naturally occurring part of the aging process fueled in part by changes in the deeper layers of skin caused by decreases in functional hyaluronic acid (skin's natural ""plumper"") and accumulated damage to collagen and elastin the elastic fibrous protein in skin's connective tissue. combined these changes lead to the loss of skin's firmness and an aged appearance. products that contain ingredients such as niacinimide caffeine glycerine and hyaluronic acid can be effective in firming skin. with the proper skin care you will see observed the benefits. thermage can be highly effective in the right candidate. this is a procedure done by your dermatologist that uses radiofrequency energy for tissue tightening and can be used both on the face and other areas of the body."	is there a product that will tighten up sagging and loose skin under the chin and jaw? is thermage effective?

"well let's establish a few medical facts before we delve into the issue of whether or not valacyclovir caused the symptoms you described. first of all the flu--or influenza --can only be caused by coming in contact with the influenza virus. thus taking valacylovir and going for a run cannot ""cause"" you to get the flu. second 'nausea' is not a symptom of influenza. the flu is a respiratory virus. it affects your nasal passages and lungs. it's true if you swallow a lot of post-nasal drip caused by the influenza virus you might get nauseated. but generally speaking the flu is a respiratory virus. it's true that nausea and headache are potential side effects of valacyclovir. however i'm not aware of fever and chills being known side effects of this drug. to be fair the most common side effects of all medications are nausea and diarrhea so i tend to consider those as 'expected' side effects. if your flu-like symptoms persist you definitely should return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. enlarged lymph nodes should not be taken lightly. if your fever exceeds 101. 3f seek emergency medical attention. meanwhile drink a lot of fluids. it's entirely possible you coincidentally picked up a virus just as you began your course of valacyclovir. the onset of your symptoms may have nothing to do with the medication but the symptoms are worthy of being evaluated further if they don't go away within a couple of days. wishing you well! in response to the answer above i never said the valacyclovir caused the flu the specific term i used was ""brought on"". also a common symptom of the flue (as i found online) is vomiting. so unless people vomit without feeling nauseous i dont see how nausea isnt a symptom of the flu. thanks for your response though."	i want to know if the flu-like symptoms i'm experiencing are from the valacyclovir i was prescribed. i was prescribed valacyclovir for treatment of hsv1. i had been taking 500mg twice daily for 4 days. on day 4 i went on a 2 mile run. i noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were somewhat swollen and tender. after sleeping for 6 hours i woke with flu symptoms. tight neck headache congestion nausea fever chills etc. i read online that these symptoms are also common side effects of the valacyclovir. is it likely that the medication in combination with the run just brought on an actual flu?
why aren't you wearing wrestling head gear that is designed to protect your ears? yes you may have a hematoma -- an accumulation of blood in the pinnae (outer ear). unless this hematoma is properly drained and managed it may turn into a cauliflower ear -- a terrible (and preventable) cosmetic deformity. you need to get this checked out immediately. it would be best to see an ent specialist but any primary care medical provider should be able to help you. take this problem very seriously my young friend. inform your parents and get that ear properly examined as soon as you can.	lump of fluid on my ear do i have cauliflower ear? . i am on my high school's wrestling team so i'm hit on the ears regularly. the lump grew in 3 days with no previous pain in that ear at all. . on the first day a small lump appeared about the size of a pencil eraser. when i woke up the second day the lump was about the size(diameter) of a dime. when i woke up the third say the lump was about the size(diameter) of a quarter. keep in mind every night i have wrestling practice and am hit either ear many times. also the pain is on the cartilage.

check out the usda label and look specifically where it says “carbohydrate ” and look under it. you’ll see a breakdown of sugars and fiber. if the product says “20 grams of carb” and underneath it says “15 grams of sugar ” run. it’s jam-packed with sugar and has a high gi. 4 grams of refined sugar is equal to 1 tsp. every tsp increases your risk for heart disease. check out the cereal you’re eating in the morning. avoid the frosted stuff as well as those loaded with granola raisins and dates. added sugars in your diet mount up over time and if you’re not vigilant you’ll be consuming way too much of the white stuff. there are several good gi food list books out there as well as multiple websites where you can learn for yourself what the gi is for carbs you’re currently eating. as a rule of thumb try to stick to foods that are less than 50 (low gi) or 55-70 (medium gi) and avoid or minimize high gi (>70) food products.	how can i know if a food has a high glycemic index (gi)?

as you have guessed poison ivy can easily be managed at home as long as you don't develop an infection. if it would make you more comfortable it would be appropriate to cover the worst areas with clean dry bandages. just be sure to change them frequently as you don't want to leave a dark moist area alone for too long. the best thing to do is to avoid scratching. using over-the-counter hydrocortisone or calamine lotion is helpful oatmeal baths cool compresses and oral antihistamines like benadryl may provide some relief. as long as the liquid that is draining is clear and colorless you're fine. if it appears to be pus please get a medical evaluation.	i contacted poison ivy and have all these horrible sores that ooze fluid. should i cover them with gauze?

hi this answer is from the uk's nhs after you have read it all the way down to the bottom you should find out you taken far to much. zinc zinc is a trace element that has several important functions. for example it: helps to make new cells and enzymes helps us process carbohydrate fat and protein in food helps with the healing of wounds good sources of zinc zinc is found widely in the environment. good food sources of zinc include: meat shellfish dairy foods – such as cheese bread cereal products – such as wheat germ how much zinc do i need? the amount of zinc you need is about: 5. 5-9. 5mg a day for men 4. 0-7. 0mg a day for women you should be able to get all the zinc you need from your daily diet. what happens if i take too much zinc? taking high doses of zinc reduces the amount of copper the body can absorb. this can lead to anaemia and weakening of the bones. what does the department of health advise? you should be able to get all the zinc you need by eating a varied and balanced diet. if you take zinc supplements it's important not to take too much because this could be harmful. don't take more than 25mg of zinc supplements a day unless advised to by a doctor. do hope this helps you. good luck	can taking zinc tablets for a cold cause green stool( four day period appx. 4-5 tablets per day)

you will need to find a free clinic; someone that can help take care of your blood pressure or you will need to pay for office visits. some practices have sliding scales and will charge you less or negotiate with your current medical provider to see if he would consider charging you less so you can keep seeing him. i do not know what kind of blood pressure medication you are taking or if this medication requires periodic monitoring or adjustments; or even routine lab work so please discuss your situation with your doctor (the one who gave you the refills) and ask for advice in this matter.	i no longer have health ins. i've got high blood pressure and have 3 refills left to my prescription. what can i do?

unfortunately no. while you may discover some natural concoctions that claim they can improve or cure keloids there are no scientific studies that prove efficacy. keloids are very challenging to manage even with the best allopathic medicines or surgical procedures so i would suggest that you consult with a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon.	are there any natural remedies other than what i would hear a doctor say to reduce the size/appearance of keloid scars?

yes. women need to get a little more calcium after menopause for instance to maintain strong bones. the recommendation increases from 1 000 mg a day before menopause to 1 200 mg after menopause. on the other hand women need less iron after menopause since they are no longer losing iron with menstruation. both before and after menopause the basic advice is the same. eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits vegetables whole grains and low-fat dairy to get the nutrients you need. consider taking a multivitamin just to make sure all your needs are covered. and talk to your doctor about whether to take additional supplements such as calcium and vitamin d.	do women's nutritional requirements change after menopause?
no. as a matter of fact antibiotics (like amoxicillin) can cause a vaginal yeast infection. because of the odor (uncommon in yeast/candidiasis) i suspect you have a bacterial infection but that is just a guess. if you do amoxicillin is not the antibiotic that would be used. insurance or not you need proper medical care.	can i treat candidiasis with amoxicillian? . i have a smelly white discharge extreme itching. i used otc miconozole crème but it didn't go away. can i self medicate with amoxicillin? i have no medical insurance.

hi could be just a thing with you perhaps an imbalance that's why the ph soap works but try shaving if you don't get rid of those beastie hairs would be a good start just in case you don't shave try washing twice a day with sea salt water in a hand basin use just a desert spoonful see how you get on. as this has been going on for so long a drastic way would be just before going to bed cut a garlic clove in half and smear this round the inside of the folds be warned it may smart for a bit then go off you may even taste garlic in your mouth its the way it works through your body. this is just an idea from things for yeast infection and bv that like yours wont go away but they do with either of these. do hope it helps in some way. good luck	itchy labia folds but not itchy vaginal opening. per my obgyn not std bacterial or yeast infection. what else? . i have really itchy labia folds especially on the right side especially around my period. i've been to the obgyn a few times she has stated it is not an std a bacterial infection or a yeast infection. what else could it be? i've tried diflucan monistat bacterial treatments creams. nothing really helps except for a good wash and sometimes ph balance soap. been going on 3+ years on and off.

this is a very interesting question with many different opinions. some say you should not have your hair dyed. some say you can have highlights placed. part of the issue is when you have your hair dyed the chemicals will be more likely to be against your scalp and possibly be absorbed while those who have highlights will not have the chemicals be against the scalp and not be absorbed. we typically don't recommend having your hair dyed in the first trimester of pregnancy since this time is the most risky to the fetus. this time is called organogenesis where the organs are forming. when women ask me about dying their hair i usually ask is it imperative. most say it is not and so i say hold off. i offer highlights. my answers are not necessarily based on solid scientific data. it is more based on common sense which says if you don't need to put chemicals on your body during pregnancy you probably should not. my doctor told me to go for it! i was in my second trimester (towards the end of it) she said as long as it doesn't have ammonia in it or strong smelling chemicals i was fine <positive_smiley> i had my baby girls with no problems from it. no	can i get my hair dyed while pregnant?

"a 21 year old losing an erection simply from putting on a condom is purely psychological so keep practicing with a cooperative partner until you solve this issue. be ""creative"" in your sexual experiments and i am sure things will improve. masturbation does not cause this problem. and. i agree. you should not be having sex without a condom. this is a frequent issue among erectile dysfunction sufferers. it happens because your mind is distracted by the physical act of applying the condom. when your mind is no longer engaged in how aroused you feel your brain will cancel the arousal program and you will lose your erection. as you are peeling the wrapper off the condom flex your penis and enjoy the feeling. then as you are putting on the condom pay attention to the sensations in your penis - how good it feels as you are applying the condom. just enough to keep your erection <positive_smiley>"	i lose my erection after i wear condom on my penis. m a 21 year old boy. whenever i wear condom on my penis i lose my erection resulting i cannot have sex. me and my partner tried to have sex 3 to 4 times but we dint had sex as i lose my erection. without condom there is no erection problem but we cant have sex without condom. is there any possibility that this erection problem is because of masturbation. i m masturbating from last 4 or 5 years almost daily. once in a day. please suggest me what should i do to have a good and long erection with condom.

"sorry to hear you're going through this. from your description it sounds like you're experiencing moderate constipation that is causing a hemorrhoid to flare up occasionally. a hemorrhoid is a swollen vein in the rectum. a hard piece of stool can basically scratch this swollen vein and cause it to bleed slightly. frequently hemorrhoids also feel itchy and painful. perhaps this is why your doctor gave you a suppository to try. suppositories often are prescribed to treat the symptoms of hemorrhoids. it sounds like you're doing everything right in terms of eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluids. because only the tip of your stool is hard it makes me think maybe you're not noticing the urge to have a bowel movement and are holding stool in your rectum too long. even though you're having a bowel movement every day you might try going to the bathroom a bit more frequently to see if you perhaps need to have a bowel movement but just aren't feeling the sensation to go. however do not strain needlessly in an attempt to force a bowel movement. that will just make any hemorrhoid situation worse. as long as you're not allergic to any medications you also might try an over-the-counter hemorrhoid medication to see if it helps shrink those swollen veins so at least the bleeding goes away. best of luck to you! this is what worked for me. as mentioned above fibrous food. i included boiled okra(twice a week for dinner) apple daily spinach (i'm an indian and i already love indian ""plain palak"" recipie dried plums(pitted prunes) 2liters of water a day. ( i follow this since i first came across this siuation) walking min of 30 mins a day. i also felt stress tension has played a role in causing this(to me atleast) i have the same problem which lead me to your thread. while i have had issues around constipation currently i have at least three bm's a day. and yes this hard piece is scraping against my hemorrhoid and causing pain and sometimes a little bleeding. i would think the answer might lie in what we are eating the combinations of food at each meal and how they digest. this issue doenst always happen for me but it is often"	why the tip of my stool is hard? it cause rectal bleed when i have my bowel movement. other part of stool is soft. i eat lots of fiber and drink lots of fluid i have bowel movement every day. this bleeding comes and go i went to my doctor and she gave me suppository but it didnt help alot. the bleeding is come and go its only when the tip of my stool is hard then it cuse bleeding again
things that can increase your risk for osteoarthritis are called risk factors. some risk factors such as your age or family history can't be changed or prevented. you may be able to reduce other risk factors for arthritis such as your weight or certain health problems by making lifestyle changes or taking medicine. for instance making some changes to your diet and exercising can help you lose weight if you need to. or taking medicine or supplements may help boost low levels of essential vitamins or hormones that are important for bone and joint health. risk factors you may be able to change or prevent include : being overweight. extra weight puts added stress on your joints and can change the normal shape of the joint. joint injury. a single major injury to a joint or several minor injuries can cause cartilage damage over time. activities that put repeated stress on a joint include squatting kneeling or heavy lifting common to some sports and jobs. lack of exercise which can cause your muscles and joints to get weak and stiff. low levels of estrogen in women especially after menopause. taking medicine or supplements may help increase estrogen levels. risk factors you can't change include : getting older. age is not a direct cause of arthritis but as you get older you're more likely to have symptoms. still not all older adults will have joint pain. a family history of arthritis. loose or odd-shaped joints. knees that bend outward (bowleg) or knees that bend toward each other (knock knees) for example can cause an imbalance in the joints because the cartilage wears down at an uneven rate. a previous infection of the joint. other types of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. metabolic or endocrine problems that cause a buildup of iron ( hemochromatosis ) copper ( wilson's disease ) or calcium ( hyperparathyroidism ) in the blood and tissues of the body. increased bone thickness. bones that are too thick may not be able to absorb impacts well and protect cartilage from trauma. decreased nerve function. when the sensory nerves in your joints that allow your body to make tiny changes in posture are damaged you're more likely to lose your balance. this problem is often seen in people who have nerve damage that may be caused by diabetes or low levels of vitamin b12. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what increases the risk of getting osteoarthritis?

your infection will be most probably a viral infection because of the season now. however we can be sure of that only after a swab is taken and it is cultured to see if there grows any bacteria in it. i give you the following suggestions to take care of the problem. however only after a thorough examination i will able to arrive at a more confirm diagnosis and institute decisive treatment. levocetirizine can be continued in the night alone. mostly the dose prescribed is 5 mg. for cough try some cough lozenges which can be taken orally. some expectorant syrup will help lighten the mucus and help cough the sputum out better. if you get fever take paracetamol 650 mg. take abundant rest if fever ensues. if fever present then it is prudent to consult a doctor and take the appropriate antibiotics. cold and nasal congestion can be alleviated using nasal decongestant drops like xylometazoline 0. 1% or oxymetazoline 0. 05%. take three drops in each nostril and lie down for 10 minutes. thereafter take steam inhalation. this i suggest you to do twice daily for three days. take salt water gargles three to four times a day. take plenty of hot fluids and refrain from having any cold products or drinks. avoid smoking and drinking during the course of all these medications. better to avoid them altogether. if fever does not relieve then you must consult a doctor. it could be worsening and you may require antibiotics or injections. if you get throat pain then it is a sign of inflammation and salt water gargles will be helpful. because of throat infection your nodes may get enlarged and become painful. if cough is not productive and if it is dry you should be seen by a doctor to ascertain if any wheeze is present. if so you have to take bronchodilators to ease the bronchial passages for air and mucus to pass through. as the details provided are insufficient and i have not examined you i cannot be decisive whether the infection is a viral or bacterial one. i cannot be sure regarding whether the upper respiratory tract presentation is of some other disease like dengue leptospirosis h1n1 etc. however the latter chances are less do not worry for now. but promptly consult with a doctor in case you are not relieved of symptoms. here i would like to emphasize the importance of green leafy vegetables to be taken daily nutritious protein rich food regular exercise and breathing exercise which if performed regularly can help prevent such infections. differential diagnosis:1. viral rhinopharyngitis. 2. acute upper respiratory tract infection. regarding follow up:for further information consult an allergy specialist online. ---> <link>	Hi doctor,I am a 49 year old male.

"if you have low bone density or osteoporosis you can still make pilates a part of your regular exercise program. however you should avoid or modify certain movements to prevent too much stress on your spine ribs and hips. it's important to work with an instructor who is knowledgeable about osteoporosis to develop a program that is safe and appropriate for your individual needs. here are some tips: avoid flexion of the spine many movements in pilates involve flexion or bending which causes the back to round into a c-curve. forward flexion brings the head and shoulders closer to the abdomen. people with osteoporosis or low bone density should avoid or modify movements with flexion. the most common pilates exercise that involves forward flexion is called ""the hundred. "" the position of the head neck and back are not safe if you have low bone density or osteoporosis. other exercises that involve flexion or bending include ab prep and scissors. you can modify these movements by keeping your head down. this will actually make these exercises more challenging. you should not feel pain in your lower back. only do what you are comfortable with. if you have low bone density or osteoporosis you should avoid pilates movements that involve flexion of the spine and cannot be modified. some of the exercises to avoid include: roll up rolling like a ball seal criss cross teaser roll over shoulder stand saw spine stretch jackknife bicycle boomerang double leg stretch single leg stretch open leg rocker crab corkscrew and neck pull. choose extension exercises people with osteoporosis or low bone density should focus on extension exercises. these include exercises that involve backward bending. some examples are: breast stroke prep one leg kick breast stroke double leg kick swan and swimming. you can put a pillow under your lowest ribs to protect them when lying face down. be careful with exercises that involve side bending and twisting a little side bending and twisting is fine but you should not push yourself to a point of strain. keep these movements small. when bending and twisting it is important to keep your spine as straight as possible. to do this imagine you are standing against a wall with your head middle back and buttocks touching the wall. you should only have a slight curve inward in your lower back. when doing movements with bending and twisting your instructor can help you make sure your form is correct."	can i do pilates if i have osteroporosis?

surgery to remove cancer is almost always the main treatment for colorectal cancer. the type of surgery depends on the size and location of your cancer. side effects are common after surgery. you may be able to reduce the severity of your side effects at home. for more information see the home treatment section of this topic. surgery choices local excision. when colorectal cancer is discovered in its very early stages it can be removed during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. the surgeon cuts out not just the polyp but also a small amount of tissue around it. the surgeon does not need to cut into the abdomen. bowel resection. this operation involves cutting out the cancer as well as the sections of the colon or rectum that are next to it. then the two healthy ends of the colon or rectum are sewn back together. the surgery can be done in two ways: open resection. the surgeon makes a long incision in the abdomen completes the bowel resection and closes the incision. open resection is the best option for cancer of the rectum. 9 laparoscopic surgery. instead of needing a large incision in the abdomen laparoscopic surgery requires only 3 to 6 small incisions. the surgeon inserts a camera or laparoscope and other operating instruments through these incisions to perform the operation. because the incisions are smaller there usually is less pain and recovery is faster. in some cases the surgeon may make 1 or 2 of the incisions a little bigger during surgery in order to complete the procedure but the opening is still far smaller than in an open resection. open resection is best for cancer of the rectum but for other colon cancers laparoscopic surgery is equally effective. 9 but laparoscopic surgery cannot always be done such as when the cancer has spread to areas outside the colon. what to think about polypectomy or local excision is used when the cancer has been caught in its early stages. bowel resection is used when the cancer is larger. sometimes after this major operation the two ends of the colon or rectum cannot be sewn back together. when this happens a colostomy is performed. most people do not need a colostomy. for more information see: bowel disease: caring for your ostomy. colorectal cancer comes back after surgery in about half of people who have surgery to remove the cancer. 7 the cancer may be more likely to come back after surgery if it was not discovered in an early stage. even if your doctor thinks that all the cancer has been removed during surgery radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be recommended to destroy any remaining microscopic areas of cancer. clinical trials are designed to find better ways to treat people with cancer and are based on the most current information. some people who meet the criteria for participation choose to enroll in such clinical trials. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for colorectal cancer?
it is not safe to give your child expired medication -- even if it is prescription or over the counter. your child may be put at risk for having an allergic reaction to the medication breaking down and the medicine may not even work. it is not worth it especially if it costs you a trip to the hospital. you should go through all of your medications once a year. make sure you get those vitamins and over the counters as well. the process is really easy for disposal: we do not recommend flushing anymore -- instead get a zip-top bag and place the medicines in the bag. you can then add some water to the bag to help them dissolve. next add kitty litter or coffee grinds zip it up and throw it in the trash. for more information visit www. smarxtdisposal. net.	is it safe to give my child a prescription medicine if it is six months past the discontinue date?
"osman the most likely cause may be anxiety related. below is a link to a webmd article that lists many possible causes of high b/p combined with a rapid pulse rate: <link> according to the american hearth association there is no direct correlation between rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. here is what the american herat association says on the subject: "" a rising heart rate does not cause your blood pressure to increase at the same rate. even though your heart is beating more times a minute healthy blood vessels dilate (get larger) to allow more blood to flow through more easily. when you exercise your heart speeds up so the blood can reach your muscles. it may be possible for your heart rate to double safely while your blood pressure may respond by only increasing a modest amount. "" other factors that are unknown may also influence a diagnosis as follows: what was your blood pressure and heart rate? what activities were you engaged in prior to being tested? how many times was the testing performed? was the testing conducted on a reliably calibrated machine? was the testing performed at various times of the day? what was your pulse pressure? that number is the difference between your systolic b/p (higher number) and the diastolic (lower number)? for example a b/p of 150/70 would have a pulse pressure of 80 which is high. as you see in this example the systolic b/p is on the slightly high side & the diastolic b/p is within a normal range but the pulse pressure is high. some experts today consider a high systolic rate along with a high pulse pressure to be a serious risk factor in predicting cardiovascular disease. it is best to see a physician and discuss your concerns. that person will be in the best position to know you conduct professional testing assess the testing results and address your questions. i hope that this answer has been helpful."	what is the relation between high blood pressure and high heart/pulse rate? . i have read that when the volume of blood is high the bp rises and the pulse slows down and vice versa however in my case the bp rises when when pulse rate increases. can you please explain this relation in bp and pulse in detail. . . . thanks. . . . osman

"it's hard to answer a question like this without a physical examination. i can give you some general thoughts on this matter. 1. what you're observing could be perfectly normal. a vein can appeal to be ""bulging"" if a person has very pale skin for example. you might look to see if the corresponding vein on the opposite side also appears to be bulging. or you might gently press on the vein to see if it feels engorged and stiff especially as compared to the same vein on the left. if so then i'd suggest you see your primary care provider. 2. high blood pressure can cause veins all over the body to bulge. it's not uncommon to see bulging veins in the head due to high blood pressure. that's another reason why if the vein truly is bulging it would be a good idea to see a doctor. please note i'm not trying to give any advice specific to your situation. these are just general observations. whenever you're experiencing something out of the ordinary or something you feel is abnormal it's always ok to see a doctor or other health care provider for an evaluation. wishing you all the best!"	what causes veins protruding on the forehead? . from behind the right ear to the middle of the forehead appears a bulging vein. what is it?

"i'm sorry you're going through this and that it's concerning you. the skin is an amazing organ. one thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skin's surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm. this engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing (a red appearance) and may make the skin feel hot. the body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core. i guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday? is it because you're exercising for example? are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes? or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day? our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if you're getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit. i mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally (your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat) but perhaps there's some underlying cause for this that should be checked out. i wish you all the best with this! i have a question for you. do you have a hard time sweating or perspiring? the purpose of sweating is to keep our bodies from overheating. over the years i have found that since i have a problem sweating my body has no way of releasing the heat and therefore anyone that comes to hug and kiss my cheek always ask me why i feel sooooo hot or like i have a fever when i don't. the heat is trapped inside. not being able to sweat is known as ""anhidrosis"" research it and ask your doctor if this could be your issue. i have also found that i have an issue with dehydration and when i drink the amount of water needed for my body weight then it helps reduce my inner heat as well as benefits me in other healthy ways. hope this helps. this is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by chinese medicine call ""empty heat"" or ""empty fire"" ""the clinical manifestations of empty heat in general (irrespective of organ) are: - a feeling of heat in the afternoon/evening - a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips - malar flush (red cheekbones) - a dry throat at night - a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles (also called a5-palm heat@) - dry stools - scanty-dark urine - a floating-empty and rapid pulse - a red tongue without coating. "" <link> applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body. see the url above for more information. western medicine does not yet understand this pattern of symptoms. i would recommend seeing a competent traditional chinese medical doctor in your area preferably one with the degree omd (orental medical doctor) a traditional chinese medical doctor not just a licensed acupuncturist.

polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) is a very complicated disorder in that it can cause many different problems. one of the things that we worry about the most is insulin resistance (similar to diabetes) which needs to be treated. another is not having a regular menstrual cycle which can lead to abnormal cells developing inside the uterus. other problems include acne high cholesterol heavy hair growth in abnormal areas and infertility. sometimes pcos will resolve with time or with weight loss but for some it is lifelong. typically it is treated with oral contraceptives to regulate your hormones and periods and/or metformin to help with the insulin resistance. it is very important for you to follow-up with your gynecologist for treatment and monitoring.	i have pcos im 17 ive had it for a 2 years now but i havent gotten any treatment what happens if i continue like this? . im 17 out of the symptoms i have oily skin acne cysts on the ovaries and obese and i havent been to the doctor since she told me i have it so im not sure of what how bad it is and i havent gotten any treatment and i just want to know what will happen if i continue like this?
getting a driver's license is a monumental event in most teenagers' lives. it's a rite of passage that many teens with epilepsy worry that they'll miss. however in most cases teens with controlled seizures can get a license like anyone else. the laws vary from state to state but generally if a person with epilepsy is on medication and hasn't had a seizure recently he or she can get a license. just how long the person must be seizure-free differs depending on where you live. also some states may allow you to get a license if you're having seizures only at a specific time of day when you wouldn't be driving (such as right before bed). some parents worry that their teens might not tell them about a seizure for fear they would lose their license. it's important to talk to your teenager about the significance of this information. having a seizure while driving could not only injure the teen but other people as well.	what happens when a teenager who has epilepsy is old enough to drive?

it’s difficult to prevent the spread of genital herpes. many people infected with the herpes virus do not know they have it and the virus can be shed through the skin to infect other people even when no sores are present. condoms reduce the likelihood of transmission of the herpes virus but the virus can be transmitted from or to skin not covered by condoms. people who know they carry the genital herpes virus should avoid having sex when any symptoms of herpes are present. people with genital herpes can take daily suppressive antiviral medication like acyclovir or valacyclovir (valtrex); this reduces (but doesn’t eliminate) the chances of infecting their partner. these are emotion-laden issues and if you have (or think you might have) genital herpes it’s important to get tested and discuss the issues with your partner before starting a sexual relationship.	how to prevent the spread of herpes?

at birth there are no bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. during birth however bacteria from the mother's colon and vagina are swallowed by the infant and within a few weeks or months they populate the infant's gastrointestinal tract. the relationship between normal intestinal bacteria and their human host is complex. the relationship is symbiotic which means that each benefits from the other. the bacteria benefit from the warm moist environment of the small intestine that is ideal for growing as well as the constant flow of food passing down the gastrointestinal tract. the human host benefits in several ways. for example the normal bacteria stimulate the growth of the intestinal lining and the immune system of the intestine. they prevent the growth of disease-causing bacteria within the intestine. they produce vitamin k which is absorbed and used by the host. in fact the bacteria are important even for the muscular activity of the small intestine. without bacteria there is reduced muscular activity. there is a delicate balance between the bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract and the human host. the gastrointestinal tract particularly the small intestine contains an extensive immune system. the immune system protects the intestine from disease-causing viruses bacteria and parasites. (the effects of the immune response have been experienced by anyone who has experienced gastroenteritis. ) the interesting fact is that the intestine does not attack the normal bacteria within it only disease-causing bacteria. somehow the intestine becomes tolerant of the normal bacteria and does not mount an attack against them. the intestine has other traits that may be important in protecting it from bacteria both normal and disease-causing. muscular activity keeps the numbers of bacteria within the intestine at a low level. mucus that is secreted into the intestine coats the intestinal lining and prevents the bacteria from touching the lining. the intestine secretes antibodies that can block and sometimes kill bacteria as well as substances that prevent the growth of bacteria. finally the lining of the intestine can produce receptors for toxic substances produced by bacteria and can prevent the substances from having their toxic effects.	what is the normal relationship between bacteria and the small intestine?
"i'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this. a number of different conditions could cause the type of sore you're describing. your best bet is to have it checked out by a health care professional. it could be something simple like a boil but an open sore any place on the body should be evaluated due to the possibility of infection. meanwhile assuming you have no medication allergies you're probably safe to clean the wound gently with plain soap and water and then apply some over-the-counter antibiotic ointment (like generic ""triple antibiotic ointment""). that's just a short-term fix however this will not cure the problem. wishing you all the best!"	i have a circular sore with an open hole in middle of it located on a cheek of my buttlock. it has slight purple hue around it and hurts when touched.
"it's tough to use the term ""cure"" for any chronic medical condition whether it's bipolar disorder (or as you put it ""manic depression"") or osteoarthritis. as you point out these conditions often can be managed through medication. when i say ""managed "" i mean the symptoms of the condition can be minimized. however these medications do not ""cure"" the condition because if you stop taking the medication then the symptoms return. with bipolar disorder it's important to take medications daily and to check in with your psychiatrist or psychologist on a regular basis. while a person with bipolar disorder may need to take medications for the rest of his or her life the dosage may need to change or the medication itself may need to be changed. new medicines are always coming on the market and often new-generation drugs not only work better than older ones but have fewer side effects. if anyone tries to convince you there's a ""cure"" for bipolar (""manic depression"") you should politely ignore them. do not allow anyone to talk you into going off your medications. there is no cure for bipolar. you should keep taking your medicines and rely on your doctor's expertise and advice. wishing you well! there is no cure for manic depression but there are very effective and natural way for managing the symptoms such as mood swings and helping you get back to a normal routine. learn more from the mr. mahendra trivedi at ""the trivedi effect"" about natural and effective ways and options for manic depressive disorder."	is there a cure for manic-depression? . besides controlling it's effects with medication on daily basis.
there is really no way to specifically and accurately address this question without an examination so i would strongly suggest that you see a urologist or the surgeon that performed your surgery. there can be many types of intrascrotal masses. hernias hydroceles varicoceles spermatoceles cysts or even tumors. properly identifying your sack of fluid is essential either by examination ultrasound or both.

first off you want to check for signs of dehydration including fewer wet diapers less play sunken eyes sunken fontanelle (soft spot on baby's head) loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. the fact that your baby isn't eating enough for adequate growth is another consideration. six months is also the time to start solids which is important for development and nutrition. this webmd article discusses various causes of diarrhea in babies. i would contact your doctor to find out if he or she wants you to come back in or get referred to a gastroenterologist. i think your gut is saying something isn't right -- and that is very important in my book.	my 6mth old weighs only 12. 8 lbs and has had diarrhea for 3 weeks what tests could be done to help determine the cause. after the first week i took her to the doctor and they diagnosed her with ear infections. she started augmentin a week later i took her back because she was still having diarrhea and loss of apetite and fevers ranging from 99. 0 - 102. 7 rectally. her wbc was 9. 5 and they said it was probably a virus. now another week has passed and she isn't better. no fevers that i have noticed but she is having watery bowel movements about 6 times a day and is only eating about 16 oz of formula a day.

it's true that for everybody your lips do flatten and become thinner over time. some people never have big lips and so they will notice it more and maybe at an earlier age. injections are one of the main ways to add volume back but for people who don't want volume that way there are some lip liners that you can use and some lip plumpers that help a little bit. most of these work by causing some irritation that increases blood supply that gives a temporary effect of fullness. for some people that works fine and otherwise it can be irritating. so there isn't that much that you can do. but you might be able to just work with a good lip gloss or a lip liner to add the appearance of volume. the other thing to think about is your teeth because your teeth is what supports your lip. if your teeth are in or pointing in or if you lose volume in terms of bone around the mouth that can also cause your lip to flatten and look thinner over time. so just getting something as simple as veneers can help invert your lip and give you great support of your lips and make a very big difference without doing any injections at all.	my lips seemed to be thinning as i get older. i don't want injections. are there other options for me?

My height is 5'5"", and weight is 69 kg. I have been suffering from acne, redness and often small, red, pus-filled bumps on my face since I am 14. I visited a lot of dermatologists, but they never able to identify the reason. I have got prescriptions and that never really helped me. The conditions worsened a year ago, and I got them on my cheeks, forehead and nose. I thought that it was a normal acne until I finally visited an experienced dermatologist, who suggested that I had subtype 3 rosacea, sensitive and oily skin. He prescribed me some medicines first, and it gave me huge relief. I got rid of all the acne within 10 days. Three months passed and as the winter season came nearer, they again started appearing all over my face and then gone after some time. I visited dermatologist again who suggested me to take regular peels. I started taking sittings of peeling and after one or two peeling my face started improving and got clear in some time. Peeling worked like magic. It was superficial face peel, but do not know about the acid content and the type of acid he used to apply. He used to say that he was giving me mild peel. I stopped taking peeling as I had to leave my place and shift to the different location due to the job change. It was good for a couple of months until the temperature change. I started getting rosacea symptoms again though at this time rate of acne and bumps was low, still, it bothered a lot. Currently, I am on medication which my old dermatologist suggested. It is Papulex face wash for summer, non-drying cleanser for winter, Fisioativ cream for the night to moisturize the skin and Fix Derma UV protection, which I still apply daily thrice a day. The only thing I notice is that in my case rosacea comes back when there is a temperature change and also some stress. But, peeling is the only real magic for me. Please suggest the best possible peeling solution available. Can I use it at home probably once in 15 days?"

pregnancy is always a tough one and the one thing i can tell you is that the recommendations are usually for lifestyle modification. pregnant women should modify their diet. i know it's hard because they want to have certain foods usually spicy but they need to cut down on these particular items. they need to really eliminate caffeine from their diet as well this will really help with the heartburn problem. if needed their ob/gyn may recommend a calcium tablet like a tums which they can chew during the day. but they want to be careful for the amount that they chew because there are calcium limits in pregnant women. antacids that contain sodium bicarbonate should not be taken by pregnant women because they can lead to fluid retention. some doctors recommend the prescription drug sucralfate for treating chronic heartburn during pregnancy. but remember women who are pregnant should talk to their doctor before using any over-the-counter or prescription drug. by talking to the pharmacist telling us your symptoms advising us that you are pregnant we will be more than happy to help you understand your options.	are there any heartburn medications that are safe to take during pregnancy?

if you are consistently taking in more calories than your body requires then you may expect to gain weight over time regardless of whether it’s calories from protein fat or carbohydrates. some research suggests however that a slightly higher protein diet can actually help you lose weight perhaps by helping you to feel satiated (feel full) to ultimately take in fewer calories. you won't gain weight as the protein ingested will store itself in your body for later use if you go above the amount your body can digest at once but don't expect to see gains in muscle. as long as you keep those saturated and trans fats out of your diet most people will keep a steady weight.	if i do not exercise and eat a lot of protein from yogurt and protein shakes would that make me gain weight? . i am 5'11 and 185 lbs

your body prefers not to use amino acids the building blocks of muscle as an energy source unless it has to because it’s simply not the most efficient way for your body to get the energy it needs. your body will typically use the more efficient means of attaining energy first. weight lifting and aerobic exercise can complement each other well but if you have concerns with not being able to gain muscle mass keep the aerobic exercise at a moderate amount. it might be best to refrain from doing overly excessive endurance aerobic events. try doing high intensity interval training. interval training involves coupling short bursts of high intensity exercise with less intense recovery periods. for example you could run on a treadmill for 1 minute at 8mph and then jog for 30 seconds at 6mph repeating for a total of 10 to 15 minutes. this is just an example to illustrate the point; you can do different intensity levels and different work to rest ratios. consider also doing circuit training which is a workout regimen involving resistance training with very little rest in between exercise sets. this form of exercise is high intensity and helps keep your heart rate elevated so that it can function as aerobic exercise while providing a foundation for muscular strength and endurance. lastly make sure that you are getting enough protein in your diet. the essential amino acids necessary for muscular growth and development can only be obtained through dietary intake. if you’re not getting enough protein you won’t be building muscle regardless of your activity. if you're training for an endurance event like a marathon when you might run 60 miles or more per week you'll almost always see a decrease in your muscle mass. for most of us who do more moderate amounts of physical activity there will be minimal if any loss in muscle mass from aerobic exercise -- so there's nothing to worry about. if you do plan on lots of aerobic exercise and are concerned about losing muscle try starting with 20-30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (at 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate) two to three days per week and see how it goes.	does aerobic exercise interfere with muscle gains from weightlifting?

most helpful answer hi this piece below has come from this site below <link> healthy bowel habits for children regular bowel movements are important to your child’s health. bowel habits—how often how much and so on—will vary from child to child. some children go more than once a day while others may skip a day or two. you can encourage healthy bowel habits by: eating healthy foods — whole grains fruits and vegetables — and drinking more water each day. children should have no more than 120 ml of 100% fruit juice per day. staying active throughout the day. this will help keep bowels working well. teaching your child not to hold a bowel movement. explaining that regular bowel movements are normal and important for good health. not using negative words like “dirty” or “stinky ” because they can make your child feel self-conscious about going to the toilet. the most common problems with bowel movements are constipation and diarrhea. look as long as it not in his pants i would not worry to much my son done much the same he normally went just as his meal was being put on the table to be honest never gave it a thought do you think your over reacting? fo me its just healthy bowels. good luck	i have a 12 year old son that constantly poops after eating. i don't know what is going on but he's always been like that we have told doctors but they don't take it as serious so is this normal. it doesn't seem to me like it is. could this have any other health issues realated could it cause him to have seizure or anything like that or is he eating to much. he's not overweight. he's 5'4 110pounds

long-term smoking generally does increase the likelihood of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). if the coughing and spitting up mucus while smoking are new symptoms it could be a signal that lung damage is occurring including the development of copd. i'd suggest your husband see a doctor about this. the coughing and spitting may or may not be related to the smoking. he will only find out by having a physical exam. keep in mind smoking damages more organs than just the lungs. smoking can have a negative impact on the heart urinary bladder colon mouth throat and many other parts of the body. quitting smoking is always the best option but i realize it can very difficult for some people to do. and some people simply don't want to quit smoking. i hope your husband goes for a physical exam to find out how his lungs and heart are doing. i wish you all the best!	my husband only coughs and spits mucus during the smoking period. is it the beginning of copd? or is he having from long.

allergic reactions to mold typically cause symptoms such as sneezing itchy/watery eyes runny nose nasal congestion or respiratory problems. this is because allergies trigger specific allergic cells to release chemicals that cause these symptoms. there is not a well understood mechanism by which mold allergy could contribute to neurocognitive symptoms. because of this i often recommend that patients pursue other investigation beside allergy so they don't miss another cause of these symptoms. if you are concerned that mold is causing symptoms you could always try techniques to decrease the mold level in your basement such as dehumidif[i]er.	could a mold allergy cause dizziness and memory loss?

i'm not sure from your question if you've been diagnosed with gallbladder disease or if you're self-diagnosing. it's important to know. gallstones can be very painful. if stones accumulate or block the bile duct surgery must be performed to remove the gallbladder. it is possible to live a long happy life without your gallbladder. if you only suspect your pain is due to problems with your gallbladder you should get a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of the pain. many conditions can mimic the pain of gallstones so it's important to get an accurate diagnosis. if your skin begins to turn yellowish you should seek emergency medical treatment as this can be a sign of a bile duct blockage. i'm sorry you're experiencing pain in your abdomen. that's never fun. wishing you well!	how do l deal with pain from gall bladder infection or gallstones
a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) is based on your symptoms medical history and a physical examination. your doctor may also want a mental health assessment which is an evaluation of your emotional functioning and your ability to think reason and remember (cognitive functioning). a mental health assessment may include an examination of your nervous system written or verbal tests and laboratory tests (such as blood and urine tests) as well as a review of your appearance mood behavior thinking reasoning memory and ability to express yourself. many people with ocd live with the condition for years before being diagnosed or they go without treatment because they are afraid or embarrassed to talk about their symptoms. answers to three initial questions may help your health professional diagnose whether you have ocd: 6 do you have repeated thoughts that cause anxiety and that you cannot get rid of no matter how hard you try? do you wash your hands frequently or keep things extremely clean and neat? do you excessively check things? if your health professional suspects you have ocd he or she will look for a full range of symptoms that will confirm the diagnosis including: 1 recurrent and persistent thoughts impulses or images that are intrusive and inappropriate cause anxiety or distress and are not simply excessive worries about real-life issues. attempts to suppress or ignore the thoughts or get rid of them with other thoughts or actions. a recognition that the obsessions are created in your own mind and don't make sense. repetitive behaviors such as hand-washing ordering praying or checking that you're driven to do in response to the obsession. the behaviors are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing a dreaded event. for a diagnosis of ocd the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (more than 1 hour a day) or greatly interfere with your normal routine at work or school and affect social activities and relationships. early detection early detection and proper treatment is very important in improving the course of ocd. this disorder is often a long-lasting (chronic) condition that will need to be monitored throughout your life. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for obsessive-compulsive disorder ocd?

actually the answer is a bit complicated. high cholesterol and diabetes are independent risk factors for heart disease. some people may have one or the other. but many people have both and they do appear to be related. scientists are studying the effects that high blood sugars and insulin resistance have on the different types of fats in the blood. insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. it helps the cells in the body take up and use glucose for energy. in diabetes the cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. glucose then builds up in the blood. the more resistant the cells are to insulin the higher the triglycerides and ldl (or bad cholesterol) levels become. at the same time the hdl (or good cholesterol) levels fall. but the good news is that both diabetes and high cholesterol can respond to the same healthy lifestyle changes. talk to your doctor about positive changes that you can make in your diet and exercise habits that can put you back on the road to good health. webmd is a great source of information about diabetes and about high cholesterol. here are two links to get you started. <link> <link> you may also want to talk to a diabetes educator or nutritionist. they can help create a diet plan that is right for you.	tested first time bs fast 135 pp 180 and s. chol 255. is choles due to diabetes or otherwise or both are independant?

we’ve had a good run with filling injections such as juvederm restylane perline artefill radiesse and recently sculptra which actually rather than offering immediate filling encourages the tissues under the skin surface to thicken and tighten. new collagen is formed. we have a large pool of experience with female patients. the ladies are happy with the results. of course people would like to have longer-lasting products with less risk and science continues to stay up all night in the laboratory working on that. botox and dysport have proven their value not only in the area of the horizontal forehead lines but the frown lines between the eyebrows and crow’s feet around the eyes. also a very hyperactive chin muscle that seems to quiver with every facial movement can be controlled with these medications which essentially lightly paralyze the nerves. how are men doing with it? well certainly there are fewer men who seek the services than women. one of the things we’ve learned is that particularly with botox and dysport it takes a larger dose to paralyze the muscle because men’s muscles are thicker. another issue that must be dealt with is that bruising must be avoided since men do not have the option of applying makeup as women do. however when the techniques are done well there is very little chance of bruising. we always favor immediate application of ice as well as encourage patients to stop taking any medication such as aspirin so that there will be less chance of bruising. we are also currently investigating using arnica as a preventative just as we use it in face and neck lifting blepharoplasty and brow surgery.	how well do injectible fillers work on men?

a standard miscarriage no matter blood type is very painful and bloody. i had a miscarriage and it was excruciating. i also with 2 normal full term pregnancys had spotting for sometimes days at a time evertime my husband and i had sex. we were very nervous the first few times. the best thing that you can do with this pregnancy and any others you may have is to keep close contact with your docs office. get a good o/b and follow up regularly. if you have the rh blood type they will immediatly begin medical attn on that and will require a difference in the routine check ups. good luck and take care of yourself and that little person growing in you.	im 16 weeks pregnant. yesterday i started spotting after having sex. its lightened up alot and i think i can still feel. the baby moving but that could be hopeful thinking. i have pco and the women in my family tend to be rh negative. there are alot of factors against this baby ever having made it this far. if the bleeding stops and doesnt start again. is there a chance my baby will make it? i have no outward cramps or pain. normal growing irritations down there but nothing i havent been experiencing before this. please give it to me straight should i run to the er or am i ok?
i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds rather mysterious. i would suggest you see your primary care provider for an evaluation. since you have not experienced any trauma to the area there is no reason it should be bruised. that said many people do experience mild trauma they subsequently forget about. if you take over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or aspirin and then bump yourself you could very well get a mild bruise. at any rate the only way to determine why you are experiencing pain and bruising in your upper back is by examination. your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and might send you for imaging tests (like x-ray or mri ). on rare occasion something concerning like a major illness can cause the symptoms you describe. that's another good reason to see a doctor. it's unlikely you are experiencing anything serious but it's safer to rule out those possibilities. wishing you well!	what could be causing upper back/spine pain? why do i have bruises? . i'm 18 yrs old and for a week i've been having upper back/spine pain. it hurts to be laying on my back or even sitting on the couch and leaning against cushions. i can't prop myself up against pillows because that'll hurt my back. i only feel better by laying on my sides or sitting while leaning forward. i noticed today that i have 2 bruises near the area that is hurting. i don't know why because i never did anything that would've caused this pain/bruising. any ideas what this could be? thanks.
"yes it is possible you are pregnant. a female of any age is fertile and capable of getting pregnant if she has already had even one period. pulling out only stops the main ejaculation dear there is what is called ""pre-ejaculate"" that comes out before he has his main ejaculation which happens during orgasm. there can be sperm present in this pre-ejaculate and you can get pregnant from it. pre-ejaculate can come out anytime during sex before he orgasms and ejaculates fully. i'm not gonna tear you down and tell you what a bad girl you've been. you made a choice and now you have to figure it out. it's extremely important that you do the following two things. first you need to see a doctor. even if this boy says he has never had sex with anyone else he could be lying. people lie. boys lie even more frequently when sex is added to the equation. so you need to see a doctor and get an std test. std's just sounds like a scary word but we're talking about possibly life-threatening diseases that can kill you if left untreated. not to mention you could accidentally give them to someone else and hurt them. second you need to take precautions if you are going to continue to be sexually active. there is no excuse for a boy not to show up with condoms. if your boyfriend shows up without several condoms knowing full well you are going to have sex then you need to turn him away at the door and tell him to come back when he has some condoms. if he really cares about you he'll find a way to get some. they give them away for free all over the country. it's not hard. and you can go ahead and let him be responsible for that. it's his sperm that'll be causing any problems so he needs to get himself in order if he wants the privilege of your company. i'm sad that i have to tell you this but this is the world in which we live: you never let a boy con you or manipulate you into unprotected sex. and they will try. they will try every day until they realize you won't stop saying no. you must be responsible for your own body because no one else will be."	i had sex august 23rd three days before my fertle window can i be pregnant he pulled out and cummed then put back in. he's 12 i'm 13. ? i had my period at 11. when should i take a test
hi o'boy who's worried the most she's on bc and had a short period well that's sometimes happens as along with weight gain now the best time to test would be if she miss's her next period. but if she thinks its best to have a test then just let her do it. good luck	my girlfriend is on birth control and had a 2 day period could she be pregnant? . hello my girlfriend is extremely worried that she may have the early signs of pregnancy. she is on birth control and has never missed a pill. her last period was a day late and very short lasting only two days. the only symptom she has noticed is a little bit of weight gain. . she will be testing tomorrow but what are the chances she could be pregnant?
there are so many different medications and we could go for hours if we went through every single one. but it really depends on what the area is. if it's a case of nasal decongestants or vitamins or things like that there are some that can't and there are some that can. but by developing that relationship with your pharmacist getting to know us on a first name basis we will be able to talk to you about anything even prescription products. we have data on prescription products about whether or not certain ones are safe to use also we can help call your doctor if you have any other concerns about a prescription. you may have been taking before you got pregnant and ask them if they want you to continue with it. but talking to your pharmacist developing that relationship that's really the key.	what common medications should i avoid during my pregnancy?

hives do not spread when you scratch them (although there are types of hives that can be caused by skin pressure). most of the time hives are caused by something you have eating breathed or touched (i know. hundreds of possibilities) and will respond to oral antihistamines.	can you spread hives on yourself by scratching similar to poison ivy? . first time i've every had them. they're from a medicine reaction and i starting scratching without thinking! they're even on the palms of my hands. maddening! and i'm snowed in and won't be able to get a remedy for a day or so. any insight would be appreciated.
this depends on a few things. if you exercise first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon you could quickly follow up with a healthy breakfast or dinner. if your workout is during non-meal time it's best to have something to replenish your muscle carbohydrate stores (called glycogen) with a little bit of protein for muscle repair and synthesis. research shows that eating foods with a combination of carbohydrates and protein is best (4:1 ratio) for recovery. here are some examples: whole wheat toast with peanut butter fruit with nuts and seeds (trail mix) apple with nut butter fruit smoothie with added protein yogurt topped with nuts chocolate milk (research has shown this to be a great recovery drink) granola/protein bar with the right combination of carb and protein for more on what to eat before during and after exercise see this webmd article.	if i am feeling really hungry after exercising what is the best thing to eat after a workout? . and i am a guy not sure if that matters.
most helpful answer that would be difficult to accurately determine since some people can harbor strep for years. i would assume that your son was more contagious within a day of his symptoms. strep can be passed on to others for about a day after an appropriate treatment has started. not all people are susceptible to getting strep easily since our immune system does a good job fighting it off. your other children have just as much chance of getting it from someone else at school than from a sibling. make sure your son with the strep does not share a drink/glass and change his toothbrush to a new one. if the toothbrushes are thrown into a drawer where they can touch other toothbrushes this is a good way to pass it on.	my son has strep throat. how long before his symptoms started showing was he contagious? . our doctor confirmed strep but i forgot to ask: how long before his symptoms started showing was he contagious? and how long does the bug take to incubate? how long to stop actively looking for symptoms in my other children?

the way you should handle diarrhea in a 3 month old really depends on how much and how often he is having the diarrhea. in many cases pedialyte is not necessary and babies can continue to have their regular formula or breast milk. in more severe cases things like pedialyte might be recommended. since young babies can become dehydrated more easily than anolder child it's a good idea to have your baby seen by your pediatrician to make sure he is not losing too much weight and fluid from the diarrhea. make sure not to give him any over-the-counter diarrhea medicines as these can be very harmful to babies and children.	my 3 month old has diarrhea and i don't know what i should do. is it okay to give him pedialite?

"""boil"" is another term used to describe an abscess which is a localized soft tissue skin infection. it usually results from staphylococcus bacteria or staph entering the skin through a puncture such as an insect bite or some other minor trauma to the skin. certain forms of staph such as mrsa (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus) can be especially difficult to treat and may require prolonged treatment (a month or more) of oral antibiotics. your diet really has nothing to do with developing an infection."	what causes boils? could i be eating something that would make me more prone to developing them?
bee-keeping hoods do not really touch the eyes and they appear to be well-ventilated so i would assume that it would not be very likely for the suit to be a major factor in transmitting microorganisms. most of the time an object of clothing may be blamed but in reality it was most likely unwashed contaminated hands that were the vector for pink eyes. you could try and disinfect the hoods between kids if that is possible or even logistically feasible.	can kids contract pink eye from dress up costumes that might be available at nature center? . i am wanting to have a bee keeping suit at our honey bee exhibit that kids put on to see what it would be like to bee keeper. unfortunately our living history farm had costumes that kids could dress up in and had several visitors complain about their kids getting pink eye. if they can get it from the costumes is there any way to prevent the spread of it? . . . . thanks

i'm sorry to hear you have arthritis. it's certainly a very common ailment. i guess i'm going to assume you're referring to osteoarthritis which is the wear-and-tear disease that makes the joints hurt. this type of arthritis frequently comes on as we get older. just to be clear there's another type of arthritis called rheumatoid arthritis that is an autoimmune disease. but based on your question i'm thinking you're referring to plain old arthritis that hurts worse when the weather gets colder. if that's the case moving from connecticut to virginia probably won't help. while it's true coldness can make the pain of osteoarthritis feel worse virginia probably isn't sufficiently warmer than connecticut in the winter to make much of a difference. now if you were talking about becoming a snowbird and flying down to florida to spend your winters then i'd probably say that's a fine idea. it's also important to take into consideration where your support system resides. when your arthritis symptoms become so severe you need help with daily or periodic tasks you need to be living where your family and friends are close enough to help you. if that's in new england then that's probably not a bad place for you to stay. i hope this helps! i've lived in va all my life and have osteo lupus and fibro. while it is warmer here in the winter than ct we do get some winters that are fairly cold - it does vary considerably and it varies a lot depending on where you live in va. another thing to weigh in is the heat and humidity - most of va especially the central and eastern half - is quite humid and is very hot in the summer. it's not unusual for it to start going into the 90's in late april and stay in that range until well into october. this summer we had long stretches of days in the high 90's - low 100's with humidity in the 80-90% range - and the combination of heat and humidity is particularly brutal especially if your arthritis causes compression of your c-spine nerves and you have a problem with sweating and body temp regulation because of it and/or if you are prone to migraines and sinus issues. the hot humid weather makes me far more miserable than the coldest days ever do and the older i get the less i seem able to tolerate it. so that's something to bear in mind when you consider moving here. (and please don't get me wrong i love my home state and am proud to be a virginian! )	i have arthritis. would it be better for me to move from ct to va. not willing to move west lots of family in the neast

most health care providers test for gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm) between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. gdm is diabetes that occurs in pregnant women who have not had diabetes before becoming pregnant. with gdm your body has a hard time using the insulin it needs to get energy from food you eat. the american diabetes association estimates that 18% of pregnancies are affected by gestational diabetes. you can lower your risk of gestational diabetes by losing excess weight getting 30 minutes of physical activity on most days and by following a balanced eating plan with a variety of foods. choose foods high in fiber and low in fat and calories. and be sure to focus on fruits vegetables and whole grains.	can i alter my diet prior to and/or while pregnant to decrease my risk of gestational diabetes?

"sorry you're going through this. it may as your pediatrician says be entirely normal for your child to sleep so little but it's obviously disturbing for you. one thing you can do to help your child develop good sleep habits is to maintain an evening routine. this is called ""sleep hygiene.

"i think what you're asking is ""my breasts became saggy and deflated after i lost weight. if i now re-gain weight will my breasts perk up again?

it’s no surprise that the latest version of the usda dietary guidelines continues to urge americans to eat less sugar. that’s a given with “sugar” generally being extra calories without any nutritional contribution and our high obesity rates. i think the biggest push should be to dramatically reduce our intake of sweetened beverages which don’t even seem to register in our brains and bodies as “consumed calories. ” talk about empty calories! it looks like we have another great reason to eat less sugar this year. sugar prices are predicted to go up for european manufacturers due to bad weather speculative hedging on supplies and stockpiling across the world. i’m guessing the sugar market in the u. s. may go through something similar. that means prices will probably go up for you and me at the supermarket when buying products containing sugar. yet another reason to think twice before buying processed food. suggestion: save money by baking your own muffins cakes and cookies. this way you can use less sugar (you can usually cut the sugar by a third from the original recipe) switch to using at least half whole-wheat flour and switch to using smarter cooking fats (like canola oil). think of it as a relaxing activity that you can do in the evening. in addition to your health your wallet may be better for it!	what are the benefits of eating less sugar?

carbon monoxide poisoning happens when you breathe too much carbon monoxide. carbon monoxide is a gas produced by burning any type of fuel-gas oil kerosene wood or charcoal. what makes carbon monoxide so dangerous is that when you breathe it it replaces the oxygen in your blood. without oxygen cells throughout the body die and the organs stop working. you can't see smell or taste carbon monoxide. but if you breathe too much of it it can become deadly within minutes. so it’s very important to know the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning what to do if you have the symptoms and how to keep it from happening. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what is carbon monoxide poisoning?

i'm sorry you're experiencing this. unfortunately the only way to diagnose what's going on is through a physical examination. many things could cause the bump you're describing such as a small cyst. only a medical professional can tell you what's going on. the key points here are: you have a bump where there shouldn't be one and it's uncomfortable. those two facts alone warrant a trip to the doctor. this isn't an emergency but why not go see your gynecologist to get this diagnosed and treated if necessary? best wishes to you! i have in the past had what amounted to a pimple in that area before. if you can stand it! leave it alone! use cold and heat if it helps! if not better in a few days go to the doctor! i couldn't stand it! did what you are not supposed to do! instant relief and healing. have found in my 46 years that i am not alone! very common from what i hear. good luck! best wishes.	small bump near entrance of vagina no discharge or anything hurts when wiped over not sexually active. what is it? . today when using the restroom i noticed a small bump near the entrance of my vagina it hurt when i wiped and it's pretty uncomfortable in general. there hasn't been any kind of discharge from it. i'm also not sexually active. what could it be?
the risk of too much folic acid is low. but as with any vitamin it is possible to consume too much folic acid if you combine supplements with food. adults should not get more than 1000 micrograms of folic acid per day. to put it into perspective a folic acid supplement or multivitamin usually has about 400 micrograms. other than breakfast cereals that are fortified with 100% of your folic acid needs (400 micrograms per day) most foods have relatively little folic acid content. for example we often recommend leafy green vegetables as a good source of folic acid. but frozen spinach which has the most folic acid has only 115 micrograms in a 1/2 cup. my point is that even if you take a folic acid supplement you still have plenty of room to enjoy foods rich in folic acid without the risk of over-consumption.	can a person consume too much folic acid?
the issue of is it safe to have multiple procedures because they add up in length. and that does have to be taken into consideration. you do have to take into consideration the length of the operation but more importantly the nature of the operation. the reason is that liposuction for example and what we call large volume liposuction has had some percentage of significant complications due to the nature of the procedure where there is just a lot of fluid being sucked out of the body and a lot of fluid being put in for the anesthesia and frankly it’s a little less scientific than we’d like it to be and for that reason the time element of the operation comes into play the volume comes in in other words that’s a major operation and if you tack that on at the end of 5 hours previously with a face lift let’s say it’s probably not always a very good idea. so again this is where common sense comes in and this is where the surgeon has to say you know you need a lot of this and maybe here’s where we do have to split it up into two trips to the operating room. so all these factors have to come into play the length of the operation and the nature of the operation and the patients own particular let’s say underlying their physiology how they are known to heal. if somebody says well i’m really a slow healer again you become a little more conservative.	could it be unsafe to have multiple procedures?

most helpful answer the most likely cause would be an infection. either a urinary tract infection or a vaginal infection. in your case it could be both. the urge to urinate is a primary symptom of a urinary infection but urethritis (irritation of your urethra) from vaginitis could also cause this annoying symptom. you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.

no sepsis itself is not contagious. sepsis is an out-of-control infection due to bacteria viruses or other invading organisms. when an infection becomes uncontrolled localized symptoms (like diarrhea from e. coli food poisoning or coughing and sneezing from influenza) become serious whole-body symptoms like a rapid heart rate low blood pressure and confusion. although a person’s infection itself may be contagious (you’d have to know the specific organism to say) sepsis is a complicated response to infection that varies widely between individuals and is poorly understood in general. however it’s clear that most people with sepsis don’t transmit their infection to anyone else and most people with infections (from any cause) don’t get sepsis.	is sepsis contagious?

until your child can shower and wash her own hair she still needs help with her oral hygiene. to prevent brushing battles here are some age-appropriate tips i've learned from patients parents and my own two boys. toddler: make tooth brushing a game. sing a silly song. get 3 toothbrushes so your toddler can hold one in each hand while you brush your child's teeth with the third brush. preschool: let him choose between two flavors of toothpaste or which brush he wants to use. after he brushes for the count of 10 it's your turn for 10. go back and forth a few times. kindergarten: allow her to do the morning brushing solo but use an egg timer so she knows how long to brush. at bedtime you get to help or at least take a turn after she finishes. elementary school: children this age should be able to brush their own teeth but you may have to remind them. ask the hygienist to give your child a personal lesson to make sure he's on track with his skills. middle/high school: there may be times when your preteen or teen takes a vacation from brushing. dental check-ups are crucial to let her know if she needs to ramp up her brushing and flossing. if all else fails you can always point out that skipping out on the twice a day regime may result in bad breath -- a sure way to keep friends and companions away. don't forget to take a fun trip to the pediatric dentist every 6 months. .	how can i encourage my children to brush their teeth?

our senses of smell and taste are intertwined. our ability to smell is what makes us able to “taste” the flavor of the foods we eat. many things can interfere with the ability to smell and taste. among the most common offenders include allergies nasal polyps and sinus infections. in these cases the loss of smell often comes on gradually. there can also be a gradual loss of smell and taste as we age. infections in the mouth may cause problems with both taste and smell as well. a sudden loss of smell is more likely caused by a virus (like the flu) or head trauma. zinc deficiency is also known to affect the sense of smell. some zinc nasal sprays on the other hand have been implicated in complete loss of smell. both alzheimer's and parkinson's disease can affect the sense of smell but other symptoms would likely be present first. rarely a tumor in the brain or sinuses can be the cause of a decrease in smell or taste. you will have to see your doctor to get to the bottom of this. and depending on the cause you may need to see an allergist ear nose and throat specialist or dentist to finally get some relief. good luck to you! whats cause you to loss taste bud no smells i havent been able to taste or smells in a while chronic sinus infection	i haven't been able to smell anything or taste for a while now what can be the cause for this?
hydrocodone is synthetic; codeine is not. hydrocodone is a prescription painkiller that is more commonly known by the brand name vicodin a drug that was originally used to control pain after surgery from an injury or an illness. hydrocodone is an opiate narcotic from the same drug family as heroin and oxycontin but is synthetic. codeine is a short-acting prescription painkiller also from the opiate class of drugs but is not synthetic. short-acting means that the effects only last a few hours which make it more dangerous especially in chronic users because it increases the likeliness of drug overdose. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	what is difference between hydrocodone and codeine?

rapid ejaculation (coming more quickly than you'd like; also called premature ejaculation) is quite common particularly among young men or those just beginning to have sex. the good news is that many men find strategies that work for them to help them last longer and gain ejaculatory control with time and practice. both the stop-start and squeeze techniques are useful long term strategies that men can use to teach themselves to pay attention to the physical sensations they experience as they get closer to climax. . short-term solutions include desensitizing condoms. that are lubricated internally with a substance that includes benzocaine. . you want to be careful not to let that substance or any other numbing agents touch your partner's mouth or vagina as it can desensitize her parts too! . to prevent premature ejaculation you need to take these 3 factors into consideration: focus on feeling focusing too much on the feelings in your penis will activate the ejaculation program (which completes within one minute. ) if you are already overstimulated before you begin intercourse you may ejaculate within seconds. performance anxiety worrying about how long you are going to last is the fastest way to lose control. this is because your lack of focus means your conscious mind is no longer focused on controlling the sexual act - which makes you lose control and ejaculate early and/or lose your erection. sexual position one of the most common sexual positions makes it difficult to stay in control of when you ejaculate. a slight tweak to this position makes it the best sexual position - and the easiest for staying connected with your partner and in control. sexual fantasies must only be used at the right time! if you are already feeling over aroused thinking about sexual fantasies will make you lose control and ejaculate. other factors to take into consideration are: sexual frustration stress and lack of confidence. all of which cause you to lose focus and lose control. hi! i am 33 years old. i tried duramale after i suffered from premature ejaculation for many months. i saw the money refund policy so i decided to buy 3 bottles on <link> since there were no risks. i was very happy about the results even after 6 weeks but i followed the treatment very strict. this was my secret i guess. i recommend duramale to everyone who suffer from early orgasm. duramale pills can be purchased only online from website through credit card debit card or paypal. for complete details and best price of duramale visit <link>	how can i prevent premature ejaculation?
if you black out and hit your head on hard tile floor resulting in a concussion it would be possible to cause some brain damage. this should be avoided of course and i would hate to see you going off to the toilet wearing a football helmet or a big pillow strapped to your head. you may be passing out because of straining -creating a vasovagal response (you can look this up on the internet). there can be other reasons of course but this is the main one to research. try to not strain during a bowel movement. use a stool softener drink plenty of water and increase fiber in your diet so that you avoid being constipated (dry hard stools). take your time on the toilet. read a good magazine. don't hold your breath or tighten your neck muscles during defecation (this is where the problem arises).	can a person die from blacking out while going to the toilet number two? . i black out every time i use the toilet for any major or semi major pooping. i know it is disgusting to talk about but i do i pass out. or everything goes black for a bit. what causes this? and is it gonna do permanent damage?

no. he is not likely getting sexually aroused. little boys can have random erections all of the time (ask the big boy in your life! ). children get pleasure from being snuggled so just snuggle him. if it creeps you out if he is interested in the feet just say no. one of my kids liked to play with other people's earlobes when he was little. just re-direct him or distract him away from those feet and i am he may give up this habit soon. you are wise not to embarrass him so be tactful. if he turns out to be an adult with a foot fetish someday (not that uncommon) he will most likely do it private and not bother anyone. you will still love him anyway.	my son is 5 years old and seems to be getting aroused with my wife's feet? why and what can we do? should we be worried? . we don't want to embarrass him but he continues to try and snuggle with my wife's feet and today she noticed that he had an erection why'll trying to touch her feet.
"yes it may be a hemorrhoid but you will need to be examined in order to get a definitive diagnosis. this cannot be done over the internet. there are other ""lumps"" that can occur in this area like perianal cysts skin tags etc. so it is prudent to get a diagnosis first before discussing treatment and/or precautions."	may have something similar to hemorrhoids but i'm not sure? need help and advice. i'm 19 years old and after going to the toilet i've always felt a lump after i've wiped. . it's never caused me pain or discomfort. but it's always been something i have been curious about. it usually. disappears after i stand up. is this a hemorrhoid? if it is. can you still have anal sex? .

actually for self-treatment in the field we don't really encourage travelers to touch base with a provider before starting treatment. many travelers will be in areas where providers may not be up to the standard of care that travelers are used to or may be in places where the medications they can obtain are not safe -- there is a big market in counterfeit medications in some developing nations. so we urge people to get the medications they may need -- and some education on when and how to use them -- from their provider before traveling. then they can self-treat as long as they have only a mild to moderate case of travelers' diarrhea.	should i see a doctor before starting antibiotics for travelers' diarrhea?
co-sleeping isn’t recommended because of what we know about sleep safety. there’s more of a risk of smothering sudden infant death syndrome and of falls off the adult bed when there’s bedsharing. if you’re breastfeeding often and you want the baby close one option is to use a bedside co-sleeper. it looks like a crib with a missing side and you can put it right next to the adult bed and raise it up to the bed’s height but an adult can’t accidentally roll over on the baby. if you’re feeding baby often you can also consider putting a bassinet cradle or crib nearby.	is bringing my baby to bed with me -- co-sleeping -- safe?

there could be a link between chlorophyll usage and hair loss / fertility issues. but the bottom line is that there is no scientific evidence through verifable studies proving that chlorophyll will cause hair growth or impact conception odds. with that said chlorophyll seems to have many possible beneficial properties. it may be a worthwhile time investment to discuss chlorophyll usage with your physician before its purchase and consumption. chlorophyll is found in green leafy vegetables and may be located in liquid form throughout health food stores. many natural medicine proponents claim that chlorophyll is a detox agent effective in heart health and protects against cancer. other claims include improvements in digestion bad breath body odor and gas conditions. specifically mentioned as effective in hormonal balancing according to the encyclopedia of natural medicine women taking chlorophyll experienced correction in conditions such as delayed menstruation and p. m. s. additionally menopause symptoms such as dry skin irritability depression and hair loss also showed improvement. in summary it’s worth some additional research and talking with your doctor about chlorophyll claims. although there is no scientific evidence of chlorophyll causing hair growth or stimulating conception some natural medicine experts cite menstruation improvement and a reduction of hair loss.	does chlorophyl help hair loss and fertility

nasal spray decongestants should not be used for more than three days. this is because they work by shrinking the mucous membranes in the nose in order to open the airways. when it wears off the mucous membranes swell up again making it hard to breathe without using the spray again. over time this can cause someone to rely on the sprays in order to breathe properly through their nose. nasal spray decongestants are safe to use if used as directed and are quite effective at relieving congestion without systemic side effects but it is important to limit their use to no more than three days.	can you really become addicted to those spray mist inhalants for a stuffy nose? is there any danger in using them?
"cold/congestion is considered as a ""stress"" situation to our body. therefore usually our body acts by raising blood sugar as it needs to provide energy to fight infection. in non-diabetic persons this situation is handled well but in diabetics that would be associated with increased sugar levels. hope your daughter would have a rapid recovery."	would a cold make a diabetic's sugar run higher? . my daughter has type 1 diabetes that is managed with an insulin pump. her a1c is usually within a good range. her sugar has been running higher lately but she has a cold and some congestion. would a cold/congestion make her sugar run higher? .
most helpful answer the penis is covered with skin and skin can itch for a variety of reasons. without an examination it would only be a blind guess to know the specific reason for your itching. it could be soap. laundry detergents or dryer softeners in your underwear causing an allergic reaction. it could be fungal (fungus loves warm dark moist areas). simple itching. not due to fungus. can be treated with 1% hydrocortisone cream over the counter. a fungal infection would require an anti-fungal cream available over the counter. since you cannot be diagnosed over the internet based solely on you very brief posting consider getting a proper examination if any of these suggestions are not helping.	why does my penis itch? ive never had sex. ok so recently i masturbated and i think it was a little to rough as my penis did get a little red the problem is now my penis itchs i think becuse the skin is healing but idk. ive never had a cold sore or had any sighs of harpies. my penis looks fine except for one red line in the middle.
not necessarily. sometimes especially in women who have normally light periods your period can just not come for a month. it's pretty common for periods to be irregular sometimes. there were a few times in which i didn't get mine for at least 3 months. my doctor said it was normal and i got birth control to regulate my periods.	my period is almost ten days late and i took some pregnency test but they keep coming out negative. could i be pregnant?

trying to get pregnant can be exciting but also frustrating at times. your wife would have to ovulate before being able to conceive so conception just before ovulation would not cause her to have a negative ovulation predictor test. it is possible that she had not ovulated yet or that she did not ovulate at all that month. it is possible that the weird feeling was because she was getting close to ovulating. remember that it is important to test for ovulation for at least 7 days midcycle. regardless if her period does not start when anticipated then take a pregnancy test. remember that 85% of couples trying to conceive will do so in 1 year.	if i got my wife pregnant right before she tested to see if she was ovulating would the test show positive? . my wife and i had sex the day before she usually tests to see if she's ovulating. she took the test two days straight and no ovulation. what could explain this? she also said that her stomach had been feeling weird since we had intercourse. could she be showing signs of pregnancy in such a short period of time?
one milligram (mg) is equal to 1 000 micrograms (mcg). therefore if you were taking 300 micrograms of melatonin then you would need to find a product that is 0. 3 milligrams of melatonin. the highest amount of melatonin found over-the-counter is 3 milligrams or 3 000 micrograms. there are different strengths available. if you cannot find the dose you are looking for speak with your local pharmacist. they can order different strengths for you to purchase that are still over-the-counter and that don’t require a prescription.	i was taking 300 mcg of melatonin. now i can only find 3 mg. which is stronger?

"the first thing that came to my mind is ""how long has this been going on for? "" anytime i hear that children have been vomiting for some time or is starting to dry heave my first words are ""call the pediatrician and go to the er""--the child is probably severely dehydrated and probably needs iv fluids. you should not give her pepto-bismol because it is not for vomiting and since this may be a virus you should not use pepto-bismol liquid because one of the ingredients is related to aspirin and is associated with reye's syndrome. pepto-bismol actually has a children’s formulation that contains calcium carbonate instead which is safe to use."	my 5 year-old was vomiting and it has turned into dry heaving. can i give her pepto bismol to halt the dry heaves?

having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman's life. women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early. this early planning process is called pregnancy planning. the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy related problems to the greatest extent possible. the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling. even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby. unfortunately many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation. pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy. the baby's organs begin developing as early as 17 days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period. some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant. others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience weight gain or abdominal enlargement. by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus. in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre-pregnancy planning. conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome. the status of the woman's immunity against german measles (rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) is also determined. women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving (see medical issues below). women who are not immune to varicella (chickenpox) can be vaccinated but should wait 30 days after vaccination before becoming pregnant. women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery. women with hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well.	what is pregnancy planning and why is it important?

if your health professional suspects that you have prostatitis he or she will begin with a complete medical history and physical exam. the type of prostatitis you have cannot be determined solely from your history and symptoms. your doctor will do tests to determine the cause of your prostatitis. acute prostatitis is the least common type but the easiest to diagnose. if acute prostatitis is suspected a urine culture will be done to test for the presence and type of bacteria. if your history and physical exam show that you do not have acute prostatitis a pre- and post-massage test (ppmt) or expressed prostatic secretions test may be done to determine which type of prostatitis you have. an expressed prostatic secretions test is not done if acute prostatitis is suspected because when the prostate is inflamed or infected massaging it to obtain a sample for tests is very painful and possibly dangerous. some health professionals believe that massaging an infected prostate increases the risk of developing a bacterial infection of the blood ( septicemia ). more tests may be necessary if: your symptoms do not improve with treatment. you continue to have prostate infections. the symptoms could be caused by bladder or prostate cancer. your health professional suspects you have a complication related to prostatitis such as an abscess. tests that may be done include: complete blood count ( cbc ). digital rectal exam to check for growths in the prostate gland or to see if it is larger than normal. blood culture to check for bacteria in your blood if you have acute prostatitis. computed tomography (ct) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of your pelvic area. transrectal ultrasound of your pelvic area. prostate specific antigen (psa) to rule out prostate cancer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for prostatitis?
the shingles vaccine is routinely recommended for adults older than 60 years of age. the vaccine is given as a single dose and is only given once. the shingles vaccine is recommended even if you have had a previous episode of shingles as long as the disease is not active. the shingles vaccine does not treat shingles it prevents shingles. in studies of adults over the age of 60 the shingles vaccine reduced attacks in half decreased how long the attacks lasted and prevented long term nerve pain (postherpetic neuralgia) in the majority of patients. the same virus that causes chickenpox causes shingles. once you have had chickenpox the virus remains dormant in your nerves. aging chronic diseases and certain medications lower the body’s immune system reactivating the virus and causing shingles. no serious problems have been identified with the shingles vaccine. the vaccine is made using a live but harmless virus. shingles can be a devastating illness so talk to your doctor about getting the shingles vaccine.	how often should i get a shingles vaccine
you don't make new hair follicle so you won't have more hair growing back. however as the hair grows back in the tip has a different shape so it feels coarser. as that hair grows in over time the ends become a little bit more tapered down and softer so it will go back to normal the way it was before you shaved. it can be darker. because over time as that hair fades as it settles on your skin and things rub against it or even as sunlight hits it it can fade and become lighter. so it may appear darker but not darker than it would have been -- than your natural hair color. so it won't be darker than it would have been at baseline. there are lots of ways to get rid of your arm hair. if you want a more permanent solution you should use a permanent hair removal system like dm6000 pro kit. it is affordable and really does the job. there are lots of these products on the market you don't have to get expensive service done and best yet you can use a product like this for other parts of your body and for other family members.	if i shave my face or lower arms will the hair grow back in darker or coarser?

"there could be a couple of things going on. first antibiotics can cause diarrhea. that diarrhea usually goes away once you stop the antibiotic. taking probiotics may help. you can get probiotics either by eating yogurt (look for ""live active cultures"" on the label) or by taking probiotic supplements. for supplements look for these probiotics -- saccharomyces boulardii and lactobacillus gg -- as they may work the best. probiotics for diarrhea <link> however another concern is that you could have a condition called clostridium difficile (also called c. diff) which is an infection that happens after you take antibiotics. cipro is one of the antibiotics that more commonly causes c. diff. we see this more in people treated with antibiotics in the hospital. however it can happen in anyone taking antibiotics. c. diff is often treated with one of the antibiotics you were on -- flagyl. clostridium difficile <link> if you try the probiotics for 2-3 days and that doesn't get rid of the diarrhea you need to let your doctor know as you may need other treatment. also if the diarrhea gets worse or you develop new symptoms also let your doctor know."	3 days after 5 days of flagyl cipro treatment i am now suffering off and on loose stools for 8 days. when will it go away. i was given this medication for a possible bacterial diarreha. had terrible side effects throughout the first 5 days (they all started once i was done with the drug). now it has been 10 days i am done with treatment and i am having off and on lose stools. no more explosive diarreha and not more than twice a day. . what is the best way to improve this besides taking probiotics and when should i start having normal bowel movements?

i've gone back and forth with the depo injections and oral contraceptives for the last decade or so i can't decide which is the lesser of the evils. there are certainly pros and cons to each but in the end i decided to stick with the oral contraceptives. why? although convenient (you only go in every quarter or so for a shot) but like you i've gained quite a bit of weight after the initial shot and my weight continue to skyrocket with each injection. after about three years i have gained a total of about 1/3 of my pre-depo body weight! not only was my body image suffering since the injections but my moods swings were swinging at full force i was tired all the time and my calcium levels were fast depleting! i loved the convenience of not having to take the pill on a daily basis but side effects of the injections turned me into someone who i ultimately hate! now that i'm back on the pill most of the side effects i've suffered from the depo has left my system and i'm somewhat back to my pre-depo body weight but i'm feeling so much more energized and alive! i didn't know the extent of the side effects until i decided on another form of birth control. true the pill may be a pain in the rear for someone as forgetful as i am but i'd rather forget and have to use a backup method than to suffer the ill effects the depo injections. birth control is a definite must for some women (myself included) and i've accepted the fact that there are side effects to any substance we take but it shouldn't interfere with our daily lives and turn us into someone/something we're not! with this experience i've learned that depo injections just didn't work for me but it may for others. in the end i think you should have an in-depth discussion with your gyn weigh your options and figure which will work best for you based on your needs your lifestyle and your preference.	birth control shot making me fat and moody? . i was on the pill for about 6 months but switched to the shot because of depression issues. i have been on the shot for about 9 months now and have gained about 30 pounds and am very moody. i need to be on birth control but don't know what method would work best for me.

the main way to prevent warts is to avoid contact with the human papillomavirus ( hpv ) that causes warts. if you are exposed to this virus you may or may not develop warts depending on how susceptible you are to the virus. in 2006 the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) approved gardasil ( hpv vaccine (what is a pdf document? ) ). it protects against four types of hpv which together cause most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. gardasil is recommended for girls 11 to 12 years old. the immunization is also recommended for females 13 to 26 years old who did not receive it when they were younger. it can be given to girls as young as 9 years old. studies show that the vaccine is safe and works well to help prevent cervical cancer and genital warts. 4 for more information see the topic immunizations. tips on avoiding the human papillomavirus avoid touching warts on yourself or others. do not share razors towels socks or shoes with another person. someone with no visible warts can still be carrying the virus. avoid walking barefoot on warm moist surfaces where the wart virus may be alive. wear shower shoes when using public showers locker rooms or pool areas. keep your feet dry. if your feet sweat heavily wear socks that absorb moisture or wick it away from the skin. avoid irritating the soles of your feet. warts grow more easily if your skin has been injured or broken in some way. tips on preventing warts from spreading keep warts covered with a bandage or athletic tape. do not bite your nails or cuticles as this may spread warts from one finger to another. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	how can warts and plantar warts be prevented?
well we have come a very very long way in technology for cleansing the skin and for taking care of our skin. so i have a feeling that if your grandmother used the products available today her skin would look even more young and more beautiful than it did in your eyes. we love our grandmas so they always look beautiful to us. but the newer cleansers are able to get the makeup off our skin without removing our natural oils and sometimes they can even add moisturizers into our skin before we even rinse off. so using the newer products will help your skin look younger and better and will help the products you put on afterwards penetrate more evenly which will be good for your skin as well.	my mom and my grandma had beautiful skin and washed their face with bar soap. why do i need a regimen to clean my face?
"an upset stomach is one of the most common discomforts during pregnancy. nausea is a result of hormonal changes and most often occurs early in pregnancy until your body adjusts to the increased production of hormones. nausea can begin in early pregnancy but is usually gone by the fourth month. it can occur at any time of the day but may be worse in the morning when your stomach is empty (this is often called ""morning sickness"") or if you are not eating enough. recommendations: if nausea is a problem in the morning eat dry foods like cereal toast or crackers before getting out of bed. or try eating a high-protein snack such as lean meat or cheese before going to bed (protein takes longer to digest). eat small meals or snacks every two to three hours rather than three large meals. eat slowly and chew your food completely. sip on fluids throughout the day. avoid large amounts of fluids at one time. try cool clear fruit juices such as apple or grape juice. avoid spicy fried or greasy foods. if you are bothered by strong smells eat foods cold or at room temperature and avoid odors that bother you. talk to your doctor about taking vitamin b6 or other treatments. contact your health care provider if your vomiting is constant or so severe that you can't keep fluids or foods down. this can cause dehydration and should be treated right away."	how can i manage nausea or vomiting during pregnancy?

if your surgery was fusion of l4 l5 andl5 s1 as a whole then it should not be moving. anterior slippage of the vertebrae can have complications on your lower limbs and even the spinal cord. the degree of slippage differs in treatment. if it is 1st degree then physiotherapy is enough with behaviour modification. if it is 2nd or 3rd degree then another surgery may be needed.

if you shave all of the hair from your body how in the world would they get a hair sample in order to test your for cannabis use? i suspect that after six weeks of abstinence from weed that your drug test would be fine but then again i have no idea how they will test you or the sensitivity of the lab doing the testing. hair samples can show evidence of past drug use so you will just have to take that chance. as an employer or medical provider i would be equally suspicious of a man coming in without a bit of hair. what are they hiding?	haven't smoked in 10 days have a hair test in 1. 5 months. if i shave every single hair off my body now will i pass? . i stopped smoking marijuana for 5 months (used to be a everyday smoker) and then this past month i slipped up for a week and smoked a couple of grams however i stopped again 10 days ago. my drug test is a hair follicle test and is in a month and a half (about 6 weeks). . so my question is if i were to shave every single hair off my body hair pits legs privates everything. in 6 weeks when i have my hair follicle test would the hair that grows back be good to go and come up clean? . thank you

i would recommend an evaluation by an otolaryngologist (ear nose and throat specialist) regarding the sinuses. i would make sure to add sun protection daily since most wrinkles are caused by sun exposure over years. if you are sensitive to sunscreen look for chemical free sunscreens. these are not absorbed into the skin and should not have an effect on your sinuses. otherwise i would see your dermatologist about possible in-office procedures to help treat the wrinkles and determine the best approach for you.	i have a very sensitive system my skin included. most products seem to cause my sinuses to hurt. any suggestions? . i use only water occasionally cetaphil cleanser then olive oil and a little mary kay foundation. i'm 55 and getting too many wrinkles.

"i am also bipolar and the first meds they put me on made me feel like a zombie. my doctor and i see each other once a month to make sure i'm staying stabilized. so far the meds i take make me feel human. although i have anxiety disorder and chronic insomnia as well severe migraines so i am going to try and separate my other meds from my bipolar meds but i will list all my meds for you. lamictal 100 mg at supper zoloft 150 mg at supper seroquel 300 mg at bed time geodon 40 mg at bedtime. i used to take depakote and hated it. i felt like a zombie that shoveled food in when i wasn't passed out. i also take clonazepam 1 mg in the morning and at supper and 2 mg at bedtime ambien 10 mg at bedtime vistaril 25 mg in the morning and at supper and 100 mg at bedtime (but the vistaril is only temporary) and migraines meds inderal and nexium for acid reflux. i think it's important as to when you take certain medications as well as what you are taking. it's a hit and miss game until you find what works for you but keep in mind it's your body and you can control to a certain degree as to what you take. talk to your doctor about different options and read up on these options before you go. i have heard of people that have taken over 20 years to finally figure out the right combination of meds to finally feel ""normal.

in my opinion it is allergic dermatitis. you may develop allergy to any food at any time. so you need to make a fiid diary to pin point the allergens. use antihistaminic otc and local steroidal topical only if it did not go well with antihistamines only. thanks	I have been getting these little red bumps over all of my body?
that's a great question for your doctor. i'd say to wear them until your doctor tells you it's ok to stop. compression stockings are worn after procedures like hip replacement to help reduce the chance of a blood clot ( deep vein thrombosis or dvt ). dvts may not occur until a couple of weeks post-surgery so you should wear the hose at least that long. if you have any fluid buildup in your legs you also need to keep wearing the compression stockings. fluid buildup can be a sign of poor circulation which again can lead to the development of a dvt. so in a nutshell seek your surgeon's advice as to when you can stop wearing the stockings. and don't stop too soon! all the best to you!	how long should you wear compression stockings after hip replacement surgery
the hpv vaccine is not a birth control medication in any way. a vaccinated woman can still get pregnant but they won't likely get hpv which can lead to cervical cancer. so far the vaccine is 100% protective. there are very few if any side effects of this vaccine (your doctor can provide you with a full disclosure). most side effects are related to the shot itself (pain redness at the injection site) not the vaccine. the vaccine is safe and highly-recommended by medical professionals.	is hpv vaccine concidered to be a birth controll medication? and what are some other side effects

most episodes of diarrhea are mild and of short duration and do not need to be brought to the attention of a doctor. the doctor should be consulted when there is: high fever (temperature greater than 101f). moderate or severe abdominal pain or tenderness. bloody diarrhea that suggests severe intestinal inflammation. diarrhea in persons with serious underlying illness for whom dehydration may have more serious consequences for example persons with diabetes heart disease and aids. severe diarrhea that shows no improvement after 48 hours. moderate or severe dehydration. prolonged vomiting that prevents intake of fluids orally. acute diarrhea in pregnant women because of concern for the health of the fetus. diarrhea that occurs during or immediately after completing a course of antibiotics because the diarrhea may represent antibiotic-associated infection with c. difficile that requires treatment. diarrhea after returning from developing countries or from camping in the mountains because there may be infection with giardia (for which there is treatment). diarrhea that develops in patients with chronic intestinal diseases such as colitis or crohn's disease because the diarrhea may represent worsening of the underlying disease or a complication of the disease both requiring treatment. acute diarrhea in an infant or young child in order to ensure the appropriate use of oral liquids (type amount and rate) to prevent or treat dehydration and to prevent complications of inappropriate use of liquids such as seizures and abnormal blood electrolytes. chronic diarrhea.	when should the doctor be called for diarrhea?
i found that having a pedometer was a big assistance in exercise. i did not set a goal to start because i knew that having been sedentary i would not be able to do 10 000 steps to start off with but i could do some walking. everyday i tried to increase the number of steps and the pedometer gave me something to gauge that with. it has become something of a game for me and it is amazing how many steps it is to go to one of the big box stores and go up and down the aisles.	how do i get started with exercise?

i have read through your complaint and the relevant details. tooth gaps in the front are inherited in families to a certain extent. a study has even proved that there is as high as 62. 5% of patients have midline gap running in families. you also have mentioned that one of your incisor teeth is rotated. this means the tooth has adjusted to space during the eruption of other permanent teeth in that row. these midline gaps can be easily corrected. there are a lot of methods to correct them. but considering your age i advise you to visit your nearby orthodontist that is braces specialist to analyse the condition. you need not worry that your teeth are deteriorating because gap closure treatment through braces does not involve any grinding of any tooth. also i would recommend you to choose braces treatment in order to correct the rotated tooth as well as the closure of the gap for a successful long time result. this is better comparing any filling procedures which cannot be claimed to be permanent. the braces treatment takes up to one year to complete. but it is worth the wait. you can smile without any shy. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I have always had perfect teeth.

sorry to hear about this. please reassure your wife there's no evidence h. pylori (or helicobacter pylori ) can be spread through kissing. h. pylori is the bacterium that causes stomach ulcers. however many people with h. pylori live with it for years and never develop symptoms. symptoms of h. pylori infection can include: burning sensation in the stomach bloating burping nausea these symptoms usually get better if you take an antacid product. you don't say how you came to be diagnosed with h. pylori or if your doctor gave you medication to treat it. if so please take the medication exactly as instructed. if you were given an antibiotic to treat your h. pylori infection be sure to take all of it. do not stop taking the medication if you begin to feel better. and again let your wife know this nurse says it's perfectly ok for you to kiss her! she won't get h. pylori from you by smooching. hope this helps!	i was diagnosed and treated for h. pylori. my wife is afraid to kiss. the dr. -no follow test required. whats your advice?
well im not a dr but theres not always symtoms to liver damage i have stage 4 liver damage n i feel fine the only true test is a biopsy talk with your dr	i have been taking 2 extra strength excedrin (250mg of acetaminophen and 250mg aspirin) every day for a few years. i have been taking 2 extra strength excedrin (250mg of acetaminophen and 250mg aspirin each) every day for a few years; i also drink about 4 glasses of red wine a day. . i am concerned that i may have done damage to my liver - i just recently noticed the warnings on the bottle. i do not have any symptoms of liver damage (not nauseous tired fatigued weak; i have a regular appetite etc. ). i won't be taking excedrin or tylenol again of course but do you think i am ok? .
i suggest that you cleanse your face twice daily with soap and water. pack a pre-moistened cleansing pad if you won't be around a water basin throughout the day. shower or bathe in tepid water rather than steaming hot water. hot water can strip your skin of needed moisture while cold water can shock your skin. avoid using cleansers or toners that tend to over-dry skin or have high alcohol content. this over-drying actually causes your skin to produce even more oil than usual. use only noncomedogenic moisturizers and sunscreen products. this means they're oil-free and won't clog pores. use vitamin a derivatives or retinoids which reduce production in oil glands and shrink their size.	i am 46 years old and have oily-combination skin. what would be the best toner for my age?
hi. i understand your concern as you are very young and should not be having so many problems for sure. from the symptoms you have mentioned it definitely seems to be a multi system disease that has affected almost all of your body systems and hormones. majorly the central nervous system seems to be affected more. even if all the tests are negative i surely feel there is something remaining that needs to be done to come to a diagnosis. you just cant let it go that way. try changing the doctor any other neurophysician or an endocrinologist will be helpful. thanks	Question: I’m a 28 year old with chronic pain, cognitive changes such as severe memory issues, painful sensitive skin,-everyone is stumped?-very scared.

it’s the bottom of the ninth. the bases are loaded with two outs. your favorite mlb team is pitching. who do you want on the mound? a recent research study would indicate that you should take his sleep habits into account before answering. a recent study presented at the 24th annual meeting of the associated professional sleep society looked at just this question. the results indicate that there appear to be two big factors for that pitcher on the mound: * is he a morning lark or a night owl? * is it a day or night game? the researchers found that pitchers who were morning types (“early birds”) as indicated on a special questionnaire performed better than those who are “night owls” overall. in the early games (those that began before 7 p. m. ) the era for pitchers who were early birds was 3. 06 while the era for the night owls was 3. 49. however if the game was in the evening (7 p. m. or later) night owl pitchers were only slightly better with an era of 4. 07 then early bird pitchers with an era of 4. 15. this research also reinforces the thought that peak physical performance is typically best for most athletes between mid-afternoon and early evening (before 7 p. m. ). the study involved eighteen pitchers from five mlb teams including: the la dodgers ny mets philadelphia phillies sf giants and the tampa bay rays. the researchers used data from a total of 1 573 innings pitched during the 2009 season and were able to account for jet lag (i. e. time zone change). so what does this mean for the boys of summer? well not only does the early bird catch the worm but he also seems to strike out the batter!	how do my sleep habits affect my waking hours?
yes. it is ok to give your child tylenol if they have taken an antihistamine. there are no drug interactions to be worried about between the two medications. always consult your pharmacist before giving your child over-the-counter medications. he/she can help you find the best product and advise you on how to give your child the proper dose.	i gave my child an antihistamine more than 12 hours ago. now he has a fever. is it ok to give him children's tylenol?
the best plan is for you to see the primary care doctor. that person can complete your physical assess your blood pressure concerns possibly start treatment if necessary and refer you to other medical specialists as needed. while waiting to see your primary care doctor i would continue to periodically take ramdom b/p readings. start a journel to record those readings along with the date and time taken whose machine was used (your own or a local pharmacy etc. ) arm used for testing standing or sitting position and all recent activities that you were engaged in (eating exercise etc. ) prior to the testing. show the journal entries to your doctor during the office visit. if you used your own machine to obtain the readings it is advisable to also bring it to your medical appointment for confirm of its accuracy.	what kind of doctor should i see for high blood pressure? . i need a physical and recently i've checked my blood pressure and it has been high. i want to know what kind of doctor should i see?

get a flu shot to prevent the flu. do not use flumist the nasal spray influenza vaccine. it is not recommended for pregnant women. to prevent exposure to flu during pregnancy: wash your hands often. avoid crowds. avoid contact with people who have a cold. do not touch your eyes nose or mouth. germs are often spread when you touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes nose or mouth. in addition call your doctor if: you have trouble breathing. your symptoms don't improve or get worse after three to four days. after feeling a little better you develop signs of a more serious problem. some signs of a more serious problem are a sick-to-your-stomach feeling vomiting high fever shaking chills chest pain or coughing with thick yellow-green mucus.	how do you prevent flu during pregnancy?
if the boy parts touch the girl parts whether you ejaculate or not there is always a small chance that pregnancy could occur. sperm can be viable in the clear mucous that emits from your penis during sexual excitation. the chance is very remote however so i think you are good. this time. if your girlfriend is also having sex with someone else that would be a different story. having a little scare like this is good practice if you continue with your risky sex-play you are eventually going to have sex. why not try and prevent it? your partner should be on an effective method of birth control and you should be wearing a condom. an erect penis is a loaded weapon my worried friend.	could my girlfriend be pregnant? . so last week my girlfriend and i laid naked in bed. we didn't have sex we did touch each other and i didn't not ejaculate. my gf told me that she has missed her period and she is worried that she may be pregnant. i told here that there was no way sense i did not penetrate her and i did not ejaculate. as a precaution i went to the drug store and bought her levonorgestrel a hormone that is used to prevent pregnancy. is there anyway possible that she could have gotten pregnant?
remember that condoms do more than just contain semen so you will not have an unintended pregnancy. condoms help protect against sexually-transmitted disease. if you are 100% sure of the sexual health and fidelity of your partner you will find the implanon to be a highly-effective contraceptive. you are not likely to get pregnant even if this was your sole means of contraception.	i just got the implanon after about 9 months of being on loestrin. is it now safe to not use condoms?

i have delt with bi-polar disorder my entire life. my mom was severely bi-polar and i was diagnosed at age 13. my mother attempted suicide over 50 times. i have one brother and two sisters who refused to deal with my mom due to the fact they thought her suicide attempts were just ways to get attention. my mother passed away in 2005. non-suicide. so now i am basically on my own with this disorder as my siblings not really wanting to have anything to do with me because they couldn't deal with my mothers bi-polar. i realize this is off topic but i would like to thank kymi84 for her earlier response. i experience alot of the same symptoms she does and until i read her response i thought it was just me. thanks for being so open and honest. as far as the main topic the illnesses or other symptoms you might have due to your bi-polar vary from person to person. aches pains headaches migraine. the list can go on and on.	what illnesses often co-exist with bipolar disorder?

that's wonderful that you are providing 24 hour care for your mom. it's also wonderful that you are focusing on your own health as well. finding ways to exercise in your home as well as working on your diet could help you lose the weight you have gained in the last year. losing weight usually takes time and taking small steps in increasing your exercise and eating fewer calories every week could help. also seeing your primary doc to make sure there is not a health reason like a thyroid problem causing your weight gain would be beneficial. being a caregiver can be challenging and many caregivers are at risk of experiencing some caregiver burnout. here is a link that provides insight for caregivers. <link> take care as in every other similar case what i want to suggest is to try increase your metabolism. there are many options in order to succed it: drink 3 litres of water/day eat 6 small meals/day eat much protein try working out even at home for a few minutes follow some of these and they will definiltely help you and remember: starvation is not a solution!	i've gone from a 10 to a 16 in the last year and have to get this weight off but i'm starving all the time. i take care of my mother and have to feed her my activity level has dropped drastically because i have to provide her 24 hr care. i used to count fat grams and that was the only successful weight loss i've ever had. i went from an 18 to a 10 (the 10 being my normal size) and kept the weight off for almost 20 years. i was going to start back on the fat grams but i'm starving all the time and can't quite seem to get back into the discipline.
it's difficult to predict the rate of progression of emphysema symptoms. much is unknown about why emphysema occurs and in whom. in some people emphysema symptoms progress faster than in others. it's believed that genetic factors make some people more vulnerable to developing emphysema. genetics may also cause some people's emphysema symptoms to progress more rapidly. the majority of people with emphysema though can expect relatively slow progression of emphysema symptoms provided they quit smoking.	how does emphysema progress?
"an allergic reaction would typically itch and have hives but not always. i have no way of really knowing if you had a cefzil allergic reaction or not but you can have a skin test to be sure. a person with 5th disease (erythema infectiosum) can have occasional ""relapses"" of the lacy rash on the lower arms and thighs as well as the characteristic ""slapped face"" appearance for weeks after the initial disease."	can you get fifth disease twice within a three week period? . i had something three weeks ago that the doctor said was an allergic reaction to cefzil antibiotics but then my two children got fifth disease and i had to take them to the doctor. but then today another lacey like rash has came up on my face. i'm not on any new medication now so i am wondering if you can get fifth disease again within a three week period or if it's possible i did have an allergic reaction three weeks ago and now i have fifth disease.
if there was unprotected sex then you should get a pregnancy test done before starting nordette. pregnancy should be ruled out as ocps are contraindicated in a pregnant woman. if the test is negative then repeat it as it can be falsely negative up to 14 days due to lack of b hcg in urine during the first two weeks post conception. wishing you best of health thanks	i had sex with my boyfriend everyday for 5 days starting on the last day of my menstruation. can i be pregnant? and can i still take nordette on the 6th day
"i'm sorry to hear you've suffered a spinal injury. that's always scary! ""c-spine"" refers to the cervical spine which consists of the first 7 vertebrae (bones) at the top of the spine (the part of the spine that connects to the base of your skull). this part of the spinal column protects some very important major nerves including the ones that enable a person to breathe. the question of whether or not you need surgery to correct your c-spine injury is entirely up to your doctor and depends on how severe the injury is. minor injuries to the cervical spine may heal on their own with help from stabilization (such as a soft or hard collar). more severe injuries may require surgery to ensure those major nerves i referred to don't get injured as well. cervical spinal fusion for degenerative disc disease or injury is not uncommon. i hope you find this information useful and that you're able to get through this without surgery!"	what is a c-spine injury and do i need surgery to correct it?
the first time you eat a food that triggers an allergic reaction your body's immune system recognizes the food as a foreign substance ( allergen ). your body reacts by developing antibodies against the food. when you eat the offending food again the antibodies attack the allergen releasing histamine and other chemicals that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. symptoms often occur within minutes although they may not occur for an hour or more. in some cases symptoms may not develop for days. in general the sooner the reaction begins the more severe it will be. symptoms may start with tingling and swelling of the mouth and tongue. when the food allergen enters the stomach and intestines cramping nausea vomiting and diarrhea can develop. symptoms may occur throughout the body when the food allergen is absorbed from the digestive system into the bloodstream. in moderate reactions the body reacts with hives and itching wheezing nasal congestion and possibly dizziness or lightheadedness. most of the symptoms of a moderate allergic reaction go away in a few hours after antihistamine medicine is taken or the food allergen leaves the body. a skin rash ( atopic dermatitis ) may persist for several weeks. in severe reactions the body releases larger amounts of histamine and other chemicals that can cause life-threatening anaphylaxis. this may happen in a few minutes to an hour. symptoms of anaphylaxis usually get better quickly after epinephrine and antihistamines are given. epinephrine which is given as a shot stops the further release of the chemicals that cause a severe reaction and counteracts the symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get food allergies?
poison ivy on the skin is not contagious. it will not spread from one area to another even it if is touched nor will it spread to another person. it can seem to spread since areas with more exposure out first and areas that were lightly exposed may break out days later. assuming that the skin has be washed to remove the original plant oil it will not spead. it is the plant oil that is the problem not any oozing from the skin lesions. it does not need to be wrapped but you can cover it lightly to keep the drainage contained.	can you wrap poison ivy in gauze so not to spread. its on both arms and its hard to not touch it on things can it be wrapped at night while i sleep and for how long can it be wrapped

knowing when you are about to release your egg can help decrease stress and increase the effectiveness of trying to conceive. while sperm can survive for up to 6 days in the female body eggs survive twelve hours. therefore most pregnancies occur when sperm are waiting for the egg. while babies have been conceived with acts of intercourse up to 6 days prior to ovulation the hightest chance of conception is within the two days prior to ovulation. learning to interpret your body's signals can help you find your fertility. cervical mucus. as the egg approaches ovulation increasing amounts of estrogen are produced and cervical mucus becomes sticky or stringy like egg whites. consistency changes as the water content of the mucus increases making penetration by sperm easier. cervical mucus changes can be identified up to 6 days prior to ovulation. timing intercourse when you notice your cervical mucus changing can be effective in helping you to conceive. ovulation predictor kits. opks detect luteinizing hormone (lh) or both lh and estradiol. as the egg moves closer to ovulation estradiol rises. while estradiol rises lh is released in increasing quantities then drops creating the lh surge that precedes egg release by 24-48 hours. to use an opk you urinate on the wick daily and look at the test kit window. with most kits one line means urine made it into the kit and two lines means lh is detected. kits that detect both estradiol and lh read low peak when estradiol only is detected and high peak when both estradiol and lh is detected. if you are able to detect the surge on the kit intercourse the day of the surge and the day after the surge should provide sperm for the arriving egg. basal body tempteratures once the egg is released progesterone is produced. progesterone increases body temperature. therefore your temperature goes up after ovulation. the best time to take your temperature is before you get out of bed in the morning. if you chart your temperature daily you should see at least an 0. 3 degree rise in the baseline temperature the day after ovulation. temperature should stay up until shortly before the period. if you have conceived your temperature will stay up during pregnancy. unlike cervical mucus changes and ovulation predictor kits basal body temperatures do not let you know that you are about to ovulate. rather they tell you that you have. so if you want to use them to time intercourse you need to chart for a month to see when you ovulated and then plan to have intercourse in the cycle days prior to the temperature rise during the next month. since menstrual cycles can be different from month to month this method can be frustrating to some. once you have seen that there is a temperature rise and that your temperature stays up for approximately 2 weeks you may wish to stop checking daily temperatures to decrease the stress of trying to conceive. if however you find the daily temperatures reassuring feel free to continue. don't worry. not all women can detect all of the signs of ovulation. follow whichever of the signs works for you. if you are unable to detect any of the changes discussed here you may not be ovulating. see your physician to make the final determination with a blood test for progesterone timed one week after the surge on your opk or rise in temperature which should be one week before your period. if you are not ovulating your physician can try to determine the cause and give you medications to help you release your egg. if the thought of testing for ovulation is frustrating to you intercourse two to three times a week should cover your fertile window.	how can i tell when i am most fertile?

poor circulation can cause all kinds of problems down there. not many people know that vitamin c is excellent for the veins and blood vessels and promotes healthy blood flow. i use a penis health creme every morning to make sure my penis is getting its daily dose of c and other important vitamins and nutrients. you should check these cremes out. i think one would help you for sure.	can bad blood circulation cause small penis girth (for an adult)? . to be more specific: i am 25 years old quite overweight/obese and am slightly below avg in girth. since being overweight/obese can cause a myriad of health issues regarding bad blood flow/circulation could this cause a lack of blood in the penis leading to a smaller girth? would losing weight and improving blood flow increase girth? would the gains be noticeable?

"hi found you this on wikipedia in humans induced lactation and relactation have been observed frequently in primitive cultures and demonstrated with varying success in adoptive mothers. it appears plausible that the possibility of induction of lactation in women (or females of other species) who are not biological mothers does confer an evolutionary advantage especially in groups with high maternal mortality and tight social bonds. the phenomenon has been also observed in most primates in some lemurs and in dwarf mongooses. lactation can be induced in humans by a combination of physical and psychological stimulation by drugs or by a combination of those methods. some couples may stimulate lactation outside of pregnancy for sexual purposes. now what is above may sound a bit odd now read this bit below the stimulation need not be intentional epidermal touching such as with finger tips tongue or lips. mental stimulation with normal brushing of nipples against the inside of brassiers can induce lactation. of course it may be embarrasing but you should not be scared. if it really bothers you try avoiding sexual thoughts or remove focus on some one you find attractive. wear a bra one size larger etc. have also found you this. lactating is linked to the hormone named ""prolactin"". only when that hormone is very high you can lactate. in a normal situation that hormone is high during last months of pregnancy and after the child is born. and continues to be high for the duration of breast feeding. if the prolactin is high without pregnancy/child breast feeding it means that your hormonal system is out of balanced in a big way! simple blood tests with your md (full hormonal pannel blood tests) will you closer to a diagnosis. the causes of your hormonal being out of balance can be multiple and it is true (somebody mentioned) that pituitary tumor is one of them also hypothyroidism is another one. in my practice i see a lot of women that have adrenal fatigue (do not ask you md about it because they do not study in school such thing only alternative practitioners) and/or hypothyroidism. the most common cause is long term stress. untreated it will eventually get to sterility and very early menopause. if you are talking about a pituitary tumor there is medication and holistic (natural) way of treating it before surgery. in fact for all hormonal imbalances there are alternative natural ways of balancing. this last part come from steady health. see so it could be you just out of balance with your hormones. interesting and do hope it helps you. good luck"	i've been lactating for over 2 years and have never been pregnant. i started randomly lactating around 2 years ago. the best answer i got at the time from my primary care doctor was that a prescription medicine i was on at the time (either geodon or trazadone) was causing this. i've been prescription drug free for over a year and the lactation is still happening. also i started taking both meds roughly 1. 5 years prior to lactating. i've never been pregnant ever. any thoughts on why this is still happening how to make it stop and side effects from this?

or. call the doctor again. i am not sure of the reason for the antibiotic if the strep test was negative. that usually indicates a virus and viruses (including mono) do not respond at all to any antibiotic. the reason for the continue fever may also indicate that an antibiotic may have been unnecessary but of course i wasn't there and can't see his throat. with that said if he is in pain not swallowing having another examination is prudent. he could still have mono since some early tests are false negative and not as accurate. 48hrs is recommended [ for adults in good health] if fever is over 103 or greater er would be suggested if ibuprofen is not reducing fever? drink lots of fluids high temps can dehydrate you and that can cause fevers to	on antibiotics for over 24hrs. fever wont go below 100. er trip? . went to dr and was tested for mono and strep. both came back negative. pain in ear and throat are making it difficult to swallow. been taking ibuprofen 800 and cold medicine but the fever will not break. when should we head to the emergency room?

there tons of studies about diabetes and how it effects the brain but first and i am probably preaching to the choir here but lets see your son start taking care of himself. i can understand that he might also be despondent and might even be depressed about his diabetes but there are lots of ways to live happily with it. back to the question at hand i read that diabetes if in check and maintain does not have any adverse affects to the brain but if out of check and when glocuse levels are high for an extended period of time some research shows that it could lead to memory lost brain shrinkage increase stroke probaility and we will be more prone to cognitive decline alzheimer's; but even high sugar levels in non-diabetes can cause these issues but because we diabetics have a hard time controlling blood sugar it is more critical for us.	effect of diabetes on the brain? . my son has been a type 1 diabetic for 40 years has not always taken good care of himself has had numerous occasions that he went into diabetic comma over the years. has there been any study on how this diabetic reations effect the brain?

surgery is rarely used to treat tuberculosis (tb). but it may be used to treat extensively drug-resistant tb (xdr-tb) or to treat complications of an infection in the lungs or another part of the body. surgery is used to: repair lung damage such as serious bleeding that cannot be stopped any other way or repeated lung infections other than tb. remove a pocket of bacteria that cannot be killed with long-term medicine treatment. surgery has a high success rate but it also has a risk of complications which may include infections other than tb and shortness of breath after surgery. surgery for tb outside the lungs surgery sometimes may be needed to remove or repair organs damaged by tb in parts of the body other than the lungs ( extrapulmonary tb ) or to prevent other rare complications such as: tb infection of the brain (tb meningitis ). your doctor may surgically place a tube (shunt) that drains excess fluid from the brain to prevent a buildup of pressure that can further damage the brain. tb infections of the heart (tb pericarditis ). your surgeon may partially remove or repair the infected sac around the heart. tb infection of the kidneys (renal tb). your surgeon may need to either remove your infected kidney or repair the kidney or other parts of the urinary system. tb infection of the joints. you may need surgery to repair damaged areas of your spine or joints (orthopedic surgery). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for tuberculosis tb?

what’s interesting about that is women in general although their bodies actually get better sleep than men historically when we look in the data they only get better sleep for short periods of time. because everything starts when the menstrual cycle begins. so when the woman’s menstrual cycle begins i’ve got patients who are really sleepy a week before their period and i’ve got women who have insomnia the week before their period. i have women who are really sleeping during their period and women who have insomnia during their period. so it’s very individualized based on your menstrual cycle and that ebb and flow is going to occur over the course of the 28 to 30 day cycle that you’re going to have throughout your entire life. then women may or may not become pregnant. that’s a whole other ball game when it comes to sleep. a lot of women are absolutely exhausted during their first trimester or have insomnia trimester. the second trimester is usually the area where women are able to fall asleep a little bit better but by the time they have their third trimester they are so uncomfortable and they can’t get into a good position that they don’t get good sleep then. now we’re talking about after the baby has come. well all bets are pretty much off once the baby has shown up especially if you’re breast feeding because then you’ve got more sleep deprivation because children are waking up needing to be fed and things of that nature. so again women have the pretty bad deal when it comes to sleep over the course of that section of their lives. when we move past that whether or not you sleep during your children’s teenage years may be another factor of your child and then you start to get into menopause. and then we’ve got significant hormonal changes that are going to cause sleepiness in some people and insomnia in others. primarily we see a lot of insomnia. there’s only been one or two studies that have looked at sleep aides with women who are going through menopause and they’ve actually shown some pretty good results in that women who are going through menopause can take some of these sleep medications and do pretty well.	how does my menstrual cycle affect my sleep?

is this the only liver function test you have? i wanted to trend it. plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) and protonix (pantoprazole) both can cause elevated liver function test but it is relatively rare with protonix. i also want to make sure that you are not using aspirin tylenol or cholesterol medications since they can have direct effects on the liver. another important point is that the slight elevation of lipase and blood sugar can happen in pancreatitis which again could be a rare side effect of protonix. but this point goes against the fact that the elevation of blood sugar is out of the proportion to the lipase levels. a person who has prediabetes may develop full blown diabetes transiently under physiological stress. i was trying to understand if you had been tested for diabetes ever and if this blood sugar was obtained in fasting. for high blood sugars i would suggest that you try to avoid high carbohydrate diet soda bakery products white bread or pasta and juices. hydrate yourself with plenty of water. can you please share your symptoms and for how long did you have them? please also share if you have been worked up for lupus or autoimmune hepatitis and your entire medication list if you can? revert back with the details to an internal medicine physician online --><link>	Hi doctor,I have been taking   Protonix  for  almost three weeks  for  acid reflux.

I do not drink,  smoke or use drugs. My doctor  ran more tests the next day, but has not gotten the results yet. So, he has not  prescribed  anything yet for my sugar levels.

pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs which is usually caused by bacteria viruses or fungi. prior to the discovery of antibiotics one-third of all people who developed pneumonia subsequently died from the infection. currently over 3 million people develop pneumonia each year in the united states. over a half a million of these people are admitted to a hospital for treatment. although most of these people recover approximately 5% will die from pneumonia. pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death in the united states.	what is pneumonia?

here are some tips on how to introduce more vegetables to your child’s diet. remember: if you try one (or all) of these suggestions it’s important that you try them over and over again. the more a child is exposed to vegetables the more likely they’ll start eating them. * try lots of different green vegetables prepared in different ways. will your child be more likely to eat broccoli if there’s a dip that accompanies it? how about eating broccoli in a soup? what about sprinkled with parmesan cheese? maybe your child would prefer broccoli roasted instead of boiled. * what about other green vegetables? if your child likes crunchy foods fresh green beans or snow and/or sugar snap peas or crunchy lettuce might be good alternatives. * when introducing any new food it’s ok if your child starts by taking pea-sized bites. get excited and even consider a reward when they increase the quantity of a previously avoided food. * have you looked at your own vegetable eating habits? when you serve vegetables do they look appealing? are you eating the same vegetables all the time or are you adding variety? remember children learn by watching others and how you eat vegetables can strongly influence your child’s vegetable eating habits. * be prepared for the possibility that your child’s preferences for vegetables may be different from yours. vegetables that taste bitter and sour to you may be tasty and savory to them. even though you’ve never been a brussels sprout fan your child might love their crunchy earthy taste. * encourage your child to describe how any new vegetable or food tastes with descriptive words like slippery crunchy mushy chewy sweet sour. discourage other descriptive words like yucky gross and other non-printable words. make a game of seeing who can come up with the most descriptive words. does it seem that your child prefers mushy textures? then more mushy vegetables it is!	how can i introduce more vegetables into my child’s diet?
that is pretty odd to have occurred as many times in one year as it has. i had pink eye once in my life and never since. it might have to do with washing necessary materials where your eye comes close or in contact with when you have pinkeye. i know i caught strep throat at college 3 times in one semester because i forgot to change my toothbrush once and didn't wash my sheets the second time so maybe close approximation to objects has been keeping the bacteria in close proximity to certain living spaces you reside often. xbox controllers and so on should be wiped down with clorox antibacterial wipes to disinfect any bacteria. hope this helps	pinkeye. i have gotten pinkeye 5 times in the last year and a half. before that i can't remember the last time i had it. it only occurs in my left eye and no one (i know) has ever gotten it from me. i've been to the doctor for it and they keep telling me its just pinkeye and its probably not bacterial and i'll be okay. but it keeps coming back and its really bothersome.

i don’t recommend waking babies for nighttime feedings because you want them to sleep. however i would suggest you wake them for night feedings in their first couple of weeks if they haven’t yet gained back their birth weight; babies tend to lose 10% of their weight after they’re born. also if they’re sleeping more in the day than the night i do suggest waking them so they don’t go more than four hours without eating. overall i suggest not waking babies at night so they can find their own sleep schedule. and you generally don’t have to wake them in the day either because most will wake on their own. if you notice that the baby is sleeping for longer stretches during the day then i would start waking them in the day so they don’t get night and day mixed up.	should i wake my baby for feedings?

"i feel i need to clarify that thyroid function (measured by tsh levels) is not related to menopause. i think what confuses some people is that the symptoms of low thyroid levels (hypothyroidism) can mirror the symptoms of menopause. when a person experiences hypothyroidism the symptoms can include fatigue depression mood swings and sleep disturbances. these symptoms also can arise as estrogen levels fall during menopause. thus an elevated tsh (which stands for ""thyroid stimulating hormone "" by the way) result like yours only indicates how well your thyroid is functioning. it does not indicate whether or not you are now in menopause. i hope you are following up with a medical professional about your tsh results. a tsh of 115 indicates your thyroid is not producing enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. people with elevated tsh readings often must take prescription thyroid hormone pills. if your healthcare provider has not suggested this you should ask why not. wishing you well!"	tsh level is 115. 3. about how long have i been in menopause? does it gradually increase? . partial hysterectomy 5 yrs ago. still have ovaries. getting anxiety and hot flashes.

your treatment depends on the cause of orchitis. in most cases where orchitis is caused by epididymitis treatment is an oral antibiotic such as cefalexin or ciprofloxacin until infection clears up. for viral infections antibiotics are not recommended. in both causes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen or ibuprofen are recommended to relieve pain. sometimes stronger pain medications in the opiate category are called for and are frequently prescribed by experienced emergency room physicians. you may be better of keeping in touch with your physician. for more information you can check out these sites: <link> <link>	what is treatment for orchitis? . severe burning pain internally between scrotum and rectum radiating down back of legs. alleviated slightly by hot bath or cold pack applied to area. was given antibiotic cipro to treat prostatitus. has been taking 6 days with little improvement. last night pain came back very strong.

dry skin is a frustrating condition and winter makes it even worse. if you have a moisturizer that does not burn then you should stick with that. here are a few more dry skin tips for winter: * take warm showers not hot. when possible rinse in cooler water. this helps your skin to not over-respond to the hot water by becoming more dry and red. * after showering washing your face or hands be sure to dry your skin completely with a dry towel. i'm not sure why this is but we tend to only partially dry our hands during the winter and this will contribute to the development of really dry skin that is prone to cracking and breaking. * use a humidifier in your room. winter air is dry and your skin suffers from this. raising the humidity in your home will help your overall symptoms. * obviously you want to stay well hydrated so drink plenty of water and water-containing beverages eat fruit and vegetables. stay away from caffeine and alcohol because they dehydrate you.	last winter my skin started to get excessively dry and crack overnight. this year it's back. what can i do?
"bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes dramatic shifts in mood inciting episodes of both mania and depression. during the ""manic"" episodes patients swing into an unrealistically ""high"" state of mind and momentarily lose touch with some realities. on the extreme end they may believe they have super powers or to a lesser extent shop vicariously for expensive items them don't need and usually can't afford. these episodes alternate with a depressive state. during this period there is a lack of energy irritability sadness and a feeling of hopelessness. in between there are can be periods where the patient seems normal balanced and in control. a small percentage of bipolar patients do however experience chronic residual symptoms. the early designation for this condition was ""manic depression"". now it is called bipolar disorder to indicate polar opposites or again shifts in mood and perception."	what is bipolar disorder and why is it sometimes called manic depression?

guar gum actually tries to make you feel like you are full especially when you eat a high fatty meal. the problem is that we have no data or evidence to show that it really really works and in some cases we've unfortunately found out that it does interact with prescription medications such as antidepressants and anti-seizure medications. so you want to avoid using this at all costs. we just don't have enough data. we already found out unfortunately through somebody ending up at the emergency room that it does cause these type of drug interactions. so if you have any questions ask your pharmacist. but also make sure you carry a medication list with you of all your medicines that you're taking both over-the-counter vitamins and prescription.	what does guar gum do for weight loss?
you need to become an expert in herpes so i am giving you some homework. <link> basically herpes is definitely contagious during an active outbreak on the lip (cold sores) or the genitals but since many people have contracted herpes when their partners do not have active lesions it is possible to catch it even during those asymptomatic dormant periods. if your boyfriend has genital lesions condoms offer good but not 100% protection as you will read.

hi the issue with hpv is that not enough is known about it for anyone to truly pinpoint when or from where the virus originated in ones body. however you should both understand that in most instances the body overcomes *active* hpv within a couple of years returning the virus to a dormant state. that means the virus can remain dormant for years and years become active and then the body has to fight it off. the best thing to do would be to sit down both of you with a doctor and talk about it. they will probably tell you the same thing--that it is very possible this was dormant in her system for years and years. do hope you find some answer here. good luck	hpv dormancy. my wife was recently diagnosed with hpv. we've been together 10 years. i trust her but i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this. i have not had any other partners so i know (or think) it couldn't have come from me. can someone with a medical degree explain to me the dormancy of this virus?

tablet splitting or pill cutting is a practice that involves patients obtaining higher-strength tablets and breaking the tablet in half quarter or whatever smaller portion they can in an effort to save money. the fda has issued a statement on this practice. splitting tablets are risky for several reasons. 1. ) you might get confused about the right dose especially if you forget to split the tablet; 2. ) splitting a tablet does not guarantee an equal distribution of medication; 3. ) some tablets are hard to split and may even crumble when attempting to split; 4. ) not all pills are safe to split especially capsules and those with specially formulations to control drug release. i suggest not splitting any medication unless you and your health-care provider have discussed the risks and benefits.	is it ok to cut a pill in half? i have 20 mg pills.

have you had your blood sugar tested lately? you describe some of the classic symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. this condition can occur when you eat a quantity of simple sugars and the body responds by producing an excessive amount of insulin. this over-reaction by the body leaves too little glucose (sugar) available to your cells for processing. symptoms of hypoglycemia can include: nausea/vomiting sweating dizziness/lightheadedness fainting shakiness heart palpitations blurred or double vision i suggest you see your primary care doctor to tell him or her about these symptoms. your provider may want you to take a fasting blood glucose test to make sure you don't have diabetes. meanwhile if you experience symptoms before you can see a doctor you can try eating a small quantity of candy or sugar to see if the symptoms resolve. it sounds odd but if your blood sugar is low you actually want to add some sugar to your body -- not a lot though. too much sugar can cause a hypoglycemic reaction all over again! wishing you well!	can sugar intake cause neausea light headed strange feeling in top body and to pass out? . i had a ekg done and nothing but it also seems that when i eat sugar i get i little head ache and my blood pressure goes up.

exercise can help you manage stress by releasing endorphins which are neurotransmitters in your brain that help you to feel good. another benefit of exercise for stress management is that it can also be used as a break or as personal time away from your stressors to clear your head if necessary. exercise can also help with depression and anxiety and can help improve your sleep help you to feel better or boost your energy levels. there is no one type of exercise that will help you manage stress better than any other. the main thing that you need to find is a type of exercise that you enjoy doing. exercise should come naturally and should be something that you look forward to doing not something that you feel forced to do and don’t get enjoyment out of. remember this is about making yourself happy so you may have to experiment with different activities until you find something that really works well for you. set realistic goals that are achievable and dedicate an amount of time that you find manageable so that you’re not adding more stress or creating another burden. besides exercise there are many other stress-reduction techniques like journaling meditating using breathing exercises or mental/guided imagery. you could also meet with a psychologist psychiatrist or your doctor to discuss other treatment/management options.	if i have alot of anger stress and emotional baggage what is the best sport i could exercise or learn to help me vent?

hi ok it seems that the two do go together this is from the uk's nhs its us brits heath service. pelvic examination women may have a pelvic examination if their gp suspects heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia. during a pelvic examination your gp will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection. they may also examine you internally. this will involve your gp inserting gloved lubricated fingers into your vagina to feel whether your uterus (womb) is tender or enlarged. a pelvic examination will not be done without your consent and you can choose to have someone with you. so the best thing for you is get back to your doctor and see about getting on iron tablets to overcome you problem. do hope this helps you. good luck	should i be worried about non-iron deficient anemia and enlarged uterus? . 53 year old female. still having fairly normal periods
most helpful answer no the sperm are just fine swimming through a little vaginal blood. vaginal blood will not prevent pregnancy but having sex during a true menstrual period means that you are not ovulating. if you are not ovulating you cannot conceive. sperm can be viable for a week or so trapped in vaginal or cervical mucous so having unprotected sex toward the end of your period is iffy so never count on this as a 100% method of birth control. some women will have vaginal bleeding mid-cycle (at a time of ovulation) so don't get fooled. for that extra-added insurance it is always wise for couples to use condoms.	does vagina blood kill sperm and prevents pregnancy?

"there are both symptoms and signs of pregnancy. these symptoms and signs depend upon the time in pregnancy. in the first trimester of pregnancy the first sign of pregnancy is most often a missed menstrual period. if a sexually active woman's periods are generally regular missing a period for a week or more is presumptive evidence of pregnancy. early symptoms of pregnancy also include feelings of breast swelling and tenderness and nausea sometimes with vomiting. ""morning sickness"" does not always occur in the morning. many women become fatigued early in pregnancy and some may feel abdominal enlargement (bloating). early in pregnancy the woman may feel she has to urinate frequently especially at nighttime and she may leak urine when coughing sneezing or laughing. this is also normal later in pregnancy and is not a problem. other changes characteristic of pregnancy include the deepening color of the areola (area surrounding the nipple) increased body temperature the mask of pregnancy (darkening of skin on the forehead bridge of the nose or cheekbones) and a dark line going down from the middle of the central abdomen area to the pubic area. eventually enlargement of the abdomen is a normal feature of the growing fetus."	what are pregnancy symptoms?

my husband also got a shingles vaccine last year and within two months got an awful case of bell's palsy. his doctor say the vaccine could not have caused the bell's palsy because the formula for this vaccine does not contain live virus culture. i remain skeptical because my husband also has a rare blood disorder. after his diagnosis with bell's i researched more and found that live culture vaccines are never recommended for anyone with a compromised immune system like my husband. still a neurologist specializing in bell's palsy has since told us that the cause may never be known so we can't narrow it down to a possible vaccine. his facial paralysis was almost gone 8 months later until today! symptoms are back we are starting over.	my husband got the shingles vaccine and then within the year got a bad case of bell's palsy. is there a connection?

the main line of treatment is with anti-epileptic drugs which are effective in controlling seizures in 70%-80% of patients with epilepsy. there are several anti-epileptic medications. since certain medications are much better for some seizures the choice of the medication should be made by a physician who is familiar with these medications. if possible the child should be evaluated in a center specializing in epilepsy. if this is not feasible usually pediatric neurologists have training in epileptic disorders and are a good source for a referral. when anti-epileptic drugs fail to control the seizures patients may improve with surgical procedures.	how is epilepsy treated?

sometimes it can be hard to get used to being healthy. this could be something as simple as having trouble with your digestion. try eating some greek yogurt getting more fiber and exercising some every day and see if that helps. if it doesn't help or if your symptoms get worse a visit with a doctor is in order. by the way gas can also cause spasms as can withdrawal from some of the drugs you were taking. colon cancer is always a possibility for all humans but in this case i would consider it to be less likely than simple gas from difficulty with digestion.	what's wrong with my digestive track? please help me it's beginning to ruin my life. for the last 2 months i have been converting my life to one that does not involve heavy alcohol use or smoking. however before all this started i frequently drank while on adderall xanax and accutane. now i've been having frequent gas issues while sitting and laying that keep me up at night and have been causing me to be depressed and anxious about my health. i keep telling myself its an early stage of colon cancer or something like that. i have also had spasms in my lower pelvic region.
eggs have been in the news a lot recently and for once it isn’t the cholesterol that is making people fearful over eggs. this time it’s salmonella enteriditis which appears to be able to infect the ovaries of chickens and can cause their eggs (usually the egg white) to be contaminated from the inside out. the eggs in question have been traced to a couple of high-volume egg producers in iowa. but this outbreak aside keep in mind that there are over 140 000 egg-related salmonella illnesses each year in the u. s. according to fda estimates. most salmonella cases don’t require a doctor visit and can resolve in one to three days according to the fda but it’s the 1 percent of cases that are severe require hospitalization and are cause for great concern. i don’t know about you but i don’t even want to experience the one to three-day salmonella poisoning. there is some hope that there will be a lower risk of salmonella from eggs in the future. new fda regulations which went into effect in july this year are expected to cut the number of salmonella-carrying eggs by 60 percent. egg-laying hens are thought to get salmonella from a couple different ways and it ain’t pretty that’s for sure — through germs carried by flies and from eating the excrement of rodents that get into their feed. i personally am not afraid to use and enjoy eggs in my recipes and meals. i just automatically cook my eggs completely. i also use half eggs and half pasteurized egg substitute or egg white when making egg-based entrees to bring down the saturated fat and cholesterol. and i try to purchase cage-free eggs (even better when they are cage-free and higher omega-3) for a variety of reasons. what else can you do? * use the eggs you buy within four weeks. * keep eggs refrigerated at least to 45f at all times. store eggs in their carton in the center of the refrigerator instead of removing them and storing them in the door which may not be cold enough. * to substantially reduce the risk of salmonella do not eat raw eggs and cook your eggs and egg dishes completely (the white and yolk will be firm. ) * wash your hands cooking utensils and food prep surfaces thoroughly after being in contact with eggshells and raw eggs. * don’t eat recalled eggs or products containing recalled eggs. * discard cracked or dirty eggs. * don’t keep eggs warm or at room temperature for more than two hours. * refrigerate unused or leftover egg-containing foods as soon as possible.	how should i store and prepare eggs safely?

a guess? yes. i suspect you have an infection such as cellulitis or a paronychia that needs immediate attention. in most cases it will be bacterial and you will need an oral antibiotic. get to an urgent care facility today or call your regular medical provider (some may just call in a prescription for you). the blisters could indicate a bullous condition such as impetigo. less-common would be a herpetic condition. you don't need a guess. you need a definitive diagnosis and treatment.	my fourth toe is painful red and swollen. it has fever and is extremely painful to touch. also has small white spot. a few days ago my fourth toe became sensitive to touch red and swollen. it has fever and is extremely painful to touch at all. i've noticed like 4 tiny blisters around the toe. the main area that has been affecting me has a faintly white spot in the middle when i squeeze the toe. it is also hard to the touch. i thought this was athletes foot but i've never had it this bad. i can't walk without a limp either. i am a 20 year old male. can you give me a guess on what this is? . .

no your doctor will most likely not be able to tell if you have been pregnant in the past by doing an exam. however it is of utmost importance that you tell your doctor about you complete medical and surgical history because it can affect your current pregnancy in significant ways. in addition it is important that you tell your doctor at your first visit. you may want to speak with the doctor first and then invite your mom in or talk to the doctor first with your mom in the room and then have her step out when the exam is done so that you can tell your doctor then. another way would be to see your doctor for your initial exam without her and then invite her to your first ultrasound. realize that the information in your medical record is completely confidential unless you indicate that it is okay to speak with specific people about it.	can a doctor tell if you've had an abortion or been previously pregnant during a vaginal exam for a new pregnancy? . i had an abortion and am now pregnant again. i had it a year ago - i had a surgical abortion and was 11 weeks along. my mother is going with me to my first exam. i don't want her to know. can a doctor tell if i've had an abortion or been pregnant before just by looking and feeling? i didn't have my abortion in the state so i wouldn't think they would have my medical files about it. i plan on telling the doctor later about the abortion but my mom will be with me in the room for the first exam.
celiac disease causes malabsorption of nutrients and leads to malnutrition. tests are available that help in the evaluation of malabsorption and malnutrition; however because other diseases can cause both malabsorption and malnutrition these tests cannot be used to diagnose celiac disease. stool examination for malabsorption fat in a sample of stool placed on a glass slide can be stained with a dye (sudan stain) to make the fat visible under the microscope as globules. stool from patients with celiac disease often contains many stained globules of fat and sudan staining is a quick and easy screening test for increased amounts of fat in the stool (steatorrhea). to conclusively diagnose steatorrhea however stool is collected over a 72-hour period and the fat in the stool is chemically measured and quantified. steatorrheic stools have abnormally high quantities of fat. since malabsorption and steatorrhea can occur with other intestinal diseases (such as small intestinal bacteria overgrowth small intestinal resection extensive crohn's disease of the small intestine and chronic pancreatitis) stools with large amounts of fat only raises the suspicion of celiac disease but cannot be used to diagnose celiac disease. blood tests for malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies malabsorption reduces the absorption of protein and causes a reduction in blood protein levels. this can be seen commonly as a reduced blood level of albumin the most concentrated protein in blood. other proteins in blood for example albumin and transferrin also may be reduced. intestinal malabsorption can lead to deficiencies and low blood levels of iron calcium vitamin b12 folate vitamin d and vitamin k. these deficiencies in turn can lead to other blood test abnormalities such as: iron deficiency anemia: iron is an important component of hemoglobin in red blood cells. when iron is deficient production of red blood cells is impaired and anemia develops. iron deficiency anemia can occur either through loss of blood (with its iron-containing red blood cells) or lack of intestinal iron absorption. heavy menstrual bleeding and cancer of the colon that bleeds into the intestine are two common causes of iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss. celiac disease causes iron deficiency anemia by reducing intestinal iron absorption. in fact iron deficiency anemia can be an important clue to the presence of celiac disease. abnormally prolonged prothrombin time (protime): protime is a blood test that measures how quickly blood clots. clotting of blood requires special proteins or clotting factors many of which are made by the liver. formation of clotting factors by the liver requires vitamin k. when vitamin k absorption from the intestine is reduced as in celiac disease the production of clotting factors by the liver is inadequate and blood clotting is delayed. delayed clotting is reflected in an abnormal protime and individuals with an abnormal protime have a higher risk of abnormal or excessive bleeding. iron deficiency anemia abnormal protime steatorrhea and low iron and vitamin levels can occur in diseases other than celiac disease. therefore the presence of these abnormalities only raises the suspicion of celiac disease but does not specifically diagnose celiac disease.	how are malabsorption and malnutrition evaluated in celiac disease?

gonorrhea is a sexually-transmitted disease so if you truly have an accurate diagnosis of gonorrhea involving your penis you did not get it from kissing a girl twice unless this kiss involved your genitals and she had pharyngeal gonorrhea. non-sexually transmitted gonorrhea is technically possible if you had penile contact with fresh secretions like a toilet seat or wearing someone's contaminated underwear but as you can imagine this rarely if ever happens. so if you are being 100% honest and i assume that you are then i would have no idea how you got it. if you had a throat culture that grew out neisseria (the genus of gonorrhea) then it will need more thorough laboratory testing since there can be an innocent gram-negative bacterial species of neisseria that grows in the throat that is not gonorrhea.	i am a gonorrhea patient. but i never had sex. i just kissed a girl twice. so what is the reason? i m so depressed. pls hp

the simple answer : osteoporosis is the demineralization or thinning of bone often seen as people age. this can make them more prone to fractures (breaks) from even minor injuries or no injuries at all. scoliosis is a term pertaining to an abnormal curvature of the spine often first detected at puberty in both boys and girls however if an older person had osteoporosis of the spine this could cause an abnormal curvature (scoliosis). so a person could have both. for more a detailed explanation of these two terms a search of webmd's massive data bank will reveal several different articles and citations for each of them.	what is the difference between osteoporosis and scoliosis?
"when a person stands up from sitting or lying down the body must work to adjust to that change in position. it is especially important for the body to push blood upward and supply the brain with oxygen. if the body fails to do this adequately blood pressure falls and a person may feel lightheaded or even pass out. orthostatic hypotension is the term used to describe the fall in blood pressure when a person stands (orthostatic= upright posture of the body; hypo= less + tension=pressure). adequate blood supply to the body's organs depends upon three factors: a heart strong enough to pump. arteries and veins that are able to constrict or squeeze. enough blood and fluid within the vessels. when the body changes position a variety of actions occur involving all parts of the cardiovascular system as well as the autonomic nervous system that helps regulate their function. the autonomic nervous system can be considered to ""run in the background"" of the body regulating body processes that we take for granted. there is a balance between the sympathetic system (adrenergic nerves) that speed things up and the parasympathetic system (cholinergic nerves) that slow things down. these names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. adrenaline (from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to stress. imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster your palms get sweaty your eyes dilate and your hair stands on end. acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system. these two systems are in balance and yet need to respond to routine changes in the body that happens throughout the day. when the body moves to a standing position pressure monitors (baroreceptor cells) located in the carotid arteries and the aorta sense a subtle drop in blood pressure because of gravity which causes blood to flow towards the legs. almost immediately the sympathetic system is stimulated causing the heart rate to increase the heart muscle to contract or squeeze more forcefully and blood vessels to constrict or narrow. all of these actions serve to increase the blood pressure so that an adequate amount of blood can still be pumped to the brain and other organs. without these changes gravity would cause the blood to remain in the lowest part of the body and away from the brain causing symptoms of lightheadedness or even passing out. orthostatic hypotension is not a disease or a complaint from an individual; it is an abnormal change in blood pressure and heart rate associated with an illness."	what is orthostatic hypotension?
that's a great question and it all depends on how frequent your heartburn is. if you just have an occasional bout of heartburn for instance you ate a spicy meal then you can use a regular antacid a maalox or a mylanta product. you want to make sure though that you shake it really well; a lot of people forget about that. also too if you are taking medications you may need to space it; either take it an hour before you take your medications or two hours afterwards because it can actually bind to the medicine and therefore the medicine won't work as well. if you notice though that you have like two days in a row where you have had consistent heartburn then you may want to try a h2 blocker. pepcid is one consideration. zantac. you want to talk to your pharmacist though and let us know if you are taking any other medications. zantac has a tendency to interact with other medicines. so if you have your medication list handy we can take a look at it and make sure there is no potential for drug interactions. if it's two or more episodes a week that you are experiencing heartburn then you are going to want to go towards the proton pump inhibitor and prilosec otc is an example of that. you want to use it for 14 days but once again you want to talk to your pharmacist to make sure that you are not taking any other medicines or possibly taking any duplicate medicines that could do the same thing. then also if you are not feeling well after the 14 days a pharmacist is probably going to refer you back to your doctor or healthcare provider because it probably needs a little bit more evaluation.	when do i use an antacid versus an h2 blocker versus a proton pump inhibitor?
seems like there are a lot of treatment options both medication as well as stuff you can do at home. from the article linked to below: good skin care is a key component in controlling eczema. for some people with mild eczema modifying their skin care regime and making a few lifestyle changes may be all that is needed to treat eczema. other people with more severe eczema may need to take medications to control their symptoms. non-drug treatments for eczema include: mild soap and moisturizer. it's best to use a mild soap to avoid over drying your skin. gentle soaps known as syndets are available at the drugstore and brand names can be recommended by your doctor. a good moisturizer (in cream lotion or ointment form) helps conserve the skin's natural moisture and should be applied immediately after a shower or bath as well as one other time each day. some people with severe eczema may benefit from taking baths with a small amount of bleach added to the water. the bleach helps to kill bacteria that lives on the skin of people with eczema. short warm showers. people with eczema should avoid taking very hot or long showers or baths which can dry out your skin. reduce stress. take steps to reduce stress. get regular exercise and set aside time to relax. medications used to treat eczema include: hydrocortisone cream. over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream may help mild eczema. prescription steroid cream may be needed for more severe eczema. antihistamines. oral antihistamines such as benedryl are available over-the-counter and may help relieve symptoms. some of these may cause drowsiness which may be of benefit if nighttime itching is a problem. corticosteroids. if other treatments fail your doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids. always follow your doctor's directions when taking oral steroids. light therapy. people with very severe eczema may benefit from therapy using ultraviolet light. immunosupressants. medications that suppress the immune system may also be an option. these medicines such as cyclosporine azathioprine or methotrexate may be used when other treatments have failed. immunomodulators. this newer type of medicated cream helps treat eczema by controlling inflammation and reducing the immune system reactions. examples include elidel and protopic. here's the original article: <link>	i have a rash of very itchy tiny red bumps all over my legs forearms and sides of my torso. looks like eczema cure? . i have had it before recently but only a little on legs and forearms. know it is roughly on 20-25 % of my body.

"one of your questions is "" are these (symptoms) just the effects of stress?

there are a several important points to consider with your question. if your uterus was surgically removed but you still have your ovaries this does not mean that you have reached menopause. when the ovaries are left intact following a hysterectomy they may function normally and produce hormones for years to come. in which case the absence of menstruation would not mean that you are in menopause. or the ovaries may stop hormone production within a year or two after the hysterectomy and lead to an earlier menopause than would normally be expected. the relationship of menopause to high blood pressure (hypertension) is complex and not fully understood. however there are some studies that suggest that declining estrogen levels may influence the lining of the blood vessels and contribute to increases in blood pressure. researchers continue to review the relationship between menopause and blood pressure. you also mention that you have gained weight. you do not mention if you are overweight but weight is also related to the risk of hypertension. excess body weight is a known risk factor for the development of hypertension and gradual weight gain throughout life has been correlated with the increase in blood pressure that occurs with aging.	i gained weight after having my uterus removed now have borderline high blood pressure. is this linked to menopause?

that would be a difficult question to answer without the ability to examine you. cold and influenza are viruses and tend to cause similar symptoms. influenza tends to be worse usually with a fever response (not just hot or cold flashes). influenza is a respiratory viruses some abdominal symptoms are not typical in adults (kids with flu can get them though). if i had to take a guess i would say that you most likely have a nasty viral infection but not necessarily influenza. the only way to be sure is to have a rapid flu test. if you have been ill for less than two days antiviral medications like tamiflu can be used. there is really nothing that can be done for a cold other than symptom control. treating the symptoms of colds and flu is often the only thing that can be done; trying to feel better while nature orchestrates the cure. both colds and flu last about a week with the first 3-4 days being the worst.	do i have the flu or a cold? . i have a headache running nose (sometimes with blood) bad cough heat and cold flashes nauseous and a loss of appetite.

"i think you're wise to get a second opinion. whether or not the x-rays look ""fine "" the truth is you're symptomatic. you deserve to learn why you're having problems. the main reason i wanted to respond though is to suggest you take your temperature. if you have a fever i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider for some blood work. a fever can be a sign of infection and infection of a prosthetic knee is always a possibility. if you do have an infection you'd want to get that treated as soon as possible. while you're waiting for your appointment with the second doctor i'd suggest you use an assistive device to help stabilize your balance so you don't fall. either a 4-point cane or a walker would be ideal. the last thing you want is to sustain an injury before you get your knee problem figured out. wishing you all the best and hoping you feel better soon!"	any ideas on whats causing my knee replacement to hurt so bad read below. i am 6 months recovering from knee replacement and my knee is worse now than before surgery. it buckles very unstable shooting pains swelling the more i stay on it worse it gets its is a zimmer flex lps gender specific any ideas. i have currently made a second opinion appointment as my current doctor says xrays are fine and he does 75 to 100 a year and i should take all my records and go see someone else so any imput will help

most helpful answer i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's enough to deal with a well-functioning colostomy let alone a leaky one! my hunch is that you need to be re-fitted for a better-fitting wafer and bag system. your stoma (and the area around it) will change shape over the next few weeks or months as swelling from the surgery decreases. this changing shape means the wafer and bag system you were sent home with may not work forever. in fact you may find you need to be re-fitted several times over the next few months -- and even years later as you gain or lose weight (which we all do! ). i'd suggest you call your surgeon's office for assistance or to request a consultation with a wound ostomy continence (woc) nurse. he or she can help you find a colostomy bag system that works for you. best wishes!	leaking colostomy bag. i just had a colostomy. my bag keeps leaking around the seal/wafer. why?

"you do need to be re-examined but not at the er. you should try and see an ent specialist or at least a primary care provider in their office. the er is really not the right place to properly diagnose and manage these things. while the er is great when you have life-threatening true emergency things like ear infections (or possible ear infections) are often triaged low in priority and quickly ""treated and streeted"". i don't know if you were misdiagnosed or not but have seen numerous misdiagnoses come from those quick er examinations. yes you could have been misdiagnosed or improperly treated. since eardrops are not the treatment for middle ear infections (unless you have an eardrum rupture or have tubes) i am suspicious when i see both an oral and an eardrop prescribed. i call this ""shotgun treatment"". the antibiotic may not have been proper or the correct dose or not needed at all (if you really didn't have a middle ear infection). you could have an eustachian tube problem in which case the antibiotic or ear drop would not help. skip the er. go directly an ent if you can or at least see a primary care medical provider who will spend more time with you and get to the bottom of this ear issue. yes go to ent. sometimes i get what sounds like the same thing. the ent does something with tubes and i drink some water and say kkkkk. sounds like witch dr. stuff eh? but it works and i think it kind of blows fluid out of the inner ear. the e. tube in my ear is very narrow so they say and does block up at times. sometimes chewing hard gum like bubble will clear it temporarily. see the ent it is so worth it. my husband lost the hearing in his right ear over the course of 2 hours last february. we have since learned that he should have had treatment with prednisone immediately and he might have had the chance to save his hearing. this is a sensorineural loss and it must be treated as a medical emergency. insist on being treated immediately you have your hearing to lose. thanks rod for your reply. at first i did try to contact my primary but earliest i could get an appointment would be february. in order to see a specialist i would need a referral and my insurance does not cover urgent care centers either. that is why i ended up going to the er. i'm going out of state tonight and wouldn't be able to do anything till i get back in over a week. i'm just concerned and the er would be my only option at this point."	only sympton can't hear anything right ear. er said middle ear infection. prescr- anti & ear drop. 3 days no improvement. 5 days ago my right ear sounded muffled. thought it need to pop - tried yawning techniques & holding my nose - no improvement. only symptom is hearing loss in right ear. no pain or pus. 3 days ago i went to er they said it was a middle ear infection prescribed antibiotic & ear drops. . i have been taking meds. as prescribed and no improvement - if anything i feel more deaf. is this normal or was i misdiagnosed? . should i go back? . thanks in advance!

"i've had sinus problems most of my adult life and i feel for you! first of all if you're blowing out clear junk rather than yellow or green mucus you probably don't have a sinus infection - at least not yet. the blood-tinged mucus may be due to something as simple as your surroundings simply being too dry. when that happens the tissue in your nose gets very dried out and can bleed. if you're like i used to be you blow your nose hard and you may even put mentholatum in the nostril just so you can get more comfortable. here's what i've learned finally to get past this very aggravating problem: start a nasal lavage with a netti pot or any warm saline but buffered solution (about 8 ounces) right after you get up and then again at least at night. you can find homemade recipes for your own solution but i just prefer the ease of opening a small packet of ready-mixed powder into the squeeze bottle (which i prefer over the traditional netti pot). that clears out the mucus. blow the nose (both sides) gently to get all the remaining mucus out. then i follow that with two sprays of a prescription corticosteroid spray of fluticasone. this is something that you should talk over with your doctor but i'd suggest (from personal experience) that you not use anything over the counter except a pure saline mist such as ayr or ocean. i prefer ayr because of the configuration of the bottle's tip. i use this in between nasal lavages when i'm really stuffed up. you can safely put petroleum jelly gently up into your nose. when i louse up and miss taking care of my sinuses as i'm supposed to i will get a small bleed site that scabs over etc. my doctor suggested vaseline and i have some in my bedroom and also in my office. during the dry winter months i have a cool air moisturizer going all the time in both my bedroom and in my home office. if you can find a ""hygrometer"" that lets you see the level of humidity in a room that helps a lot. i bought the kaz cool mist units. good performance and 2-year warranty plus no white stuff coming out to get all over everything. there are sometimes initial problems with impeller noise that is 'way too loud but kaz customer relations people are absolutely great at getting that problem solved over the phone in less than 5 minutes and then you have a perfectly functional humidifier. i'm sold on mine and will get more as needed. i paid only $35 at my local pharmacy for mine. hope this helps. can you tell my work load here at home is low this am? glad i had the time to forward some tips to help you out."	do i have a sinus infection i have blood in my snot when i blow my nose?

home treatment for hair loss includes hair care and hairstyling techniques that may help you cover thinning or bald spots on the scalp. this may be easier for women because inherited hair loss ( androgenetic alopecia ) causes a general thinning that is usually not as severe as it is in men. hair sprays dyes and perms can help make the hair appear fuller. in women with inherited hair loss hair care and the occasional use of grooming products hair sprays hair color teasing permanents or frequent washing will not increase hair loss. but if your hair loss is caused by hair care then perms and dyes may contribute to more hair loss. for both men and women hair thinning and baldness increase the risk of sunburn and skin cancer on the scalp. when in the sun wear a hat or use a sunscreen with an spf of 30 or more to prevent sun damage to the scalp. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what can i do to treat hair loss at home?

well that's kind of weird isn't it? i'm sorry you're going through this. the shoulder and arm area is an odd place to get a rash or a breakout of something like atopic dermatitis. if the rash is happening only on one side it's probably worth having a health care provider look at it though it's probably not any sort of emergency. if the rash is occurring on both shoulders/arms then you might consider causes such as laundry detergent (mild allergy or reaction) dryer sheets wearing new clothes before washing them a change in the type of soap you use (again possibly a mild allergic reaction) or something along those lines. if the rash/blotchiness doesn't clear up on its own or if it gets worse spreads or your begin having swelling of the face/mouth and/or shortness of breath then you need to seek medical care. best wishes as you try to solve this mystery!	i have skin redness/scratchlike rashes around my shoulder and arm area not from scratching but it looks just like it. . it does not itch. no bumps or soarness. just red scratch like rashes and blotchy arm redness.

' canaliths are tiny particles made of protein and calcium carbonate. normally they are attached to hairs within the otolith structures of the ear. the otolith structures are responsible for balance sensing acceleration and orientation. if the canaliths fall off the hairs that hold them in place they can fall into the inner ear and cause dizziness. in fact displaced canaliths or their debris are thought to be responsible for many cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv) which is a fancy term for dizzy spells that happen when you turn your head or change positions. when a person has bppv a health care provider can perform the epley maneuver to reposition the canaliths into the otolith structures. this usually cures the bppv. it would be difficult to perform this maneuver yourself. however a skilled practitioner can do it quickly right in the exam room. wishing you well! great question! you're referring to canaliths also called 'ear stones' or 'ear crystals.

the liver is responsible for metabolizing vicoden and alcohol. the liver can metabolize only a certain amount of alcohol per hour regardless of the amount that has been consumed. the rate of alcohol metabolism depends in part on the amount of metabolizing enzymes in the liver which varies among individuals and appears to have genetic determinants. in general after the consumption of one standard drink the amount of alcohol in a drinker's blood (blood alcohol concentration or bac) peaks within 30 to 45 minutes. (a standard drink is defined as 12 oz of beer 5 oz of wine or 1. 5 oz of 80-proof distilled spirits all of which contain the same amount of alcohol. ) alcohol is metabolized more slowly than it is absorbed. since the metabolism of alcohol is slow consumption needs to be controlled to prevent accumulation in the body and intoxication. everyone’s metabolism by the liver can vary depending on several different factors including age food consumption body weight gender and most importantly and most controllably drug-drug interactions. alcohol has a drug-drug interaction with acetaminophen (tylenol). many studies have shown that liver damage can occur with the combination of acetaminophen and alcohol.	how long after drinking a margarita do you have to wait before taking a vicoden for muscle pain?
white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. as they mature white blood cells are continually released into the bloodstream. white blood cells circulate throughout the body ready to fight infections. they live about two or three weeks when they are broken down and recycled by the body. a normal white blood cell count is between about 4 500 and 10 000 cells per microliter. many conditions can cause a low white blood cell count: • infection (which usually increases the white blood cell count but may decrease it). • drugs especially chemotherapy. • human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). • severe alcohol abuse. • radiation therapy. • cancer affecting the bone marrow. • connective tissue disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). many african-americans have a naturally lower white blood cell count. this is caused by a gene mutation that may have evolved as a defense against malaria. most often a low white blood cell count is temporary and improves on its own.	what causes a low white blood cell count?

simply put the cigarette smoke attracts inflammatory cells (white blood cells including neutrophils lymphocytes and macrophages) into the lung. then the inflammatory cells release substances called proteases. the proteases dissolve the proteins in the alveolar walls (septae) and thereby destroy the septae. as a result the alveoli join together (coalesce) to form the larger irregular inefficient air sacs. it turns out that about half of all smokers develop emphysema. mild emphysema is seen occasionally in non-smokers and may be due to passive smoking (exposure to other people smoking) and industrial air pollution. severe emphysema however is seen only in smokers or in some people with rare inherited diseases (e. g. alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency). still it takes about 30 years of smoking to develop fatal emphysema. this is because people usually don't die from emphysema until more than 60% of the lung tissue is affected.	how does emphysema happen?

crohn's disease cannot be prevented because the cause is unknown. but you can take steps to reduce the severity of the disease. medicines taken regularly may reduce sudden (acute) attacks and keep the disease in remission (a period without symptoms). most experts recommend acetaminophen ( tylenol for example) for pain relief rather than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. nsaids have been linked to flare-ups. 3 do not smoke. smoking makes crohn's disease worse. eat a healthy diet. never use antibiotics unless they have been prescribed for you by a doctor. get regular exercise. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	how can crohns disease be prevented?

scarring results from a either a tear in the dermis (stretch marks) or an overgrowth of collagen with raised scars (keloids ). there is really no way to prevent scars completely. if you are genetically predisposed to scar formation you probably will have a scar. once a keloid scar develops intervene early (before the scar is raised and thickened) and massage your scar frequently with a vitamin e based moisturizer; this helps break down additional collagen build-up. during pregnancy remain well-hydrated in order to keep the dermis healthy and less susceptible to tearing also moisturize with a vitamin e based moisturizer.	what can i do about cesarean section or pregnany scars?

surgery to cover bald areas of the scalp may be used to treat hair loss. if successful surgery may be a permanent treatment for hair loss. surgery choices the most common types of surgery to treat hair loss include: hair transplantation surgery. during this surgery your doctor will move small grafts (pieces of skin with hair follicles) from areas of your scalp with full hair to areas of your scalp that are bald or thinning. the grafts may include single hairs or up to 30 hairs in one graft. this is the most common type of surgery used to treat hair loss. scalp reduction. scalp reduction involves removing large areas of bald scalp from the head. sections of the scalp with growing hair are then stretched and sewn together to fill in the bald areas. scalp flaps. scalp flaps involve moving a large section of scalp containing hair from the side and back of the scalp to a bald area. one side of the flap remains attached to the scalp as the section of scalp with hair is moved to cover a bald area. the complication rate of this procedure is higher than other procedures because of bleeding scarring and infection after surgery. what to think about surgery may be a more permanent solution than medicines to treat hair loss but it is expensive involves surgical risks and there is a chance that not all hair follicles will remain healthy. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for hair loss?

"the recommended maximum daily dose per manufacturer and fda is ambien 10 mg per day. the medication is rapidly absorbed in the body and eliminated over a 2. 5 hr time period. this means that the body will not accumulate any of the medication. she would probably experience the side effects quicker than usual. if she has only done this for one dose there are no issues to worry about at this time. common side effects include drowsiness dizziness diarrhea and a ""drugged feeling.

use sun protection every day all year round protect against excess sun exposure and exfoliate on a regular -- but not daily -- basis. look for gentle products that do not strip away the outer layers just gently remove the excess dead skin cells ready to slough off. the outer layers of skin cells are called the stratum corneum and studies show that this layer helps protect against sun damage and against excess water loss from the skin. when it is an even smooth layer the skin looks more radiant and younger. retinoids emollients and gentle exfoliants help achieve this goal.	what is the best routine to prevent aging?

"food manufacturers know what people like to eat. they study taste and change up ingredients to enhance taste. that means adding refined sugars fats and salt to so many products -- i don't call many of them ""food "" but instead ""food-like products"" since there's nothing natural about them. there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that there may be two groups of people -- those with no history of addiction in their families but they develop addictive tendencies with processed foods they were weaned on; and another group that has a strong family and personal history of addiction for whom food is a transference of the addiction (you give up drinking smoking or drugs and begin to overeat)."	can some foods be addictive?
"i'm glad you asked. a nutritional supplement is not likely to help with premature ejaculation and there's no scientific evidence any of these ""male enhancement"" products actually help with male sexual performance. what concerns me is the number of these ""all natural"" ""herbal"" supplements that have been found (at least in the u. s. ) to contain actual prescription medications designed to treat erectile dysfunction. the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) has issued several alerts and recalls over the past few years on this type of product (though not vigormax specifically that i know of). the addition of these prescription drugs to over-the-counter dietary supplements is illegal and dangerous. manufacturers do not disclose these drugs on the label. so my advice to you is to seek medical treatment for your premature ejaculation issue and to give the nutritional supplements a pass. some things you can do to help with premature ejaculation: stop smoking drinking or using illicit drugs use a condom to reduce sensation in the penis try different sexual positions to reduce stimulation until ejaculation is desired sometimes doctors will prescribe antidepressant medications to treat premature ejaculation. hope this helps!"	is it safe to use vigormax supplement for premature ejaculation and vitality in sex? . i am 47. male. no health problem including diabetese. height 5ft 10 in. weight 82 kg. bp normally is (130 - 85)

seborrheic dermatitis is thought to be a combination of over-production of oil glands and yeast on the skin's surface. unfortunately seborrheic dermatitis can be a lifelong problem characterized by prolonged inactive periods and flare-ups. if you suffer from seborrheic dermatitis consider using selenium- or ketoconazole-containing shampoos at least once per week. when you wash your hair also apply a small amount of the shampoo on the problematic areas on your face and then rinse your hair and face simultaneously. over-the-counter corticosteroids will control minor flare-ups. more severe reactions should be evaluated by your dermatologist.	i've been dealing with seborrheic dermatitis for about a year. how can i further control and prevent it?

facial and jaw pain is common in fm. several structures including the head (scalp and brain) neck tmj and facial/jaw muscles all have nerve branches to the face that can lead to pain numbness and altered sensations (called dysesthesias). if the pain comes and goes in relationship to another area of pain i. e. tmj jaw neck then it may be referred pain from myospasms or tm joint etc. if it comes spontaneously and feels like shocks or stabs then it could be more neuralgia-mediated like trigeminal neuralgia. rarely in someone with fm a different cause such as ms bell's palsy acoustic neuroma or even a viral infection (cold) can cause face and jaw pain. but these other conditions are usually evident by additional symptoms or a different clinical course that your doctor can determine by evaluating you. i try various treatments on my patients with facial pain including meds that block nerve pain (i. e. anti-seizure meds snris [serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors] tricyclics) and topicals with helpful meds (patches compounded cream). therapies including tns trail or injections or bite splints or other treatments can be tried depending on the individual's cause of pain. as usual i can't provide specific advice for anyone here but i encourage you to work together with your doctor for your symptoms.	i have stabbing pain along my cheekbone to the jaw and upper section of my teeth. is it that common in fibromyalgia?

"hi this is from the nhs in the uk gives most of the answers you want. iron deficiency anaemia rarely causes serious or long-term complications although some people with the condition find it affects their daily life. some common complications are outlined below. tiredness as iron deficiency anaemia can leave you tired and lethargic (lacking in energy) you may be less productive and active at work. your ability to stay awake and focus could decrease and you may not feel able to exercise regularly. increased risk of infections research has shown iron deficiency anaemia can affect your immune system (the body’s natural defence system) making you more likely to become ill. heart and lung problems adults with severe anaemia may be at risk of developing complications that affect their heart or lungs. for example you may develop tachycardia (an abnormally fast heartbeat) or heart failure (where your heart is not pumping blood around your body very efficiently). pregnancy complications pregnant women with severe anaemia have an increased risk of developing complications particularly during and after birth. they may also develop postnatal depression (which some parents experience after having a baby). research suggests babies born to mothers who have untreated anaemia are more likely to: be born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a low birthweight have problems with iron levels themselves do less well in mental ability tests restless legs syndrome some cases of restless legs syndrome (rls) are thought to be caused by iron deficiency anaemia. doctors may refer to this as ""secondary rls"". rls is a common condition affecting the nervous system which causes an overwhelming irresistible urge to move the legs. it also causes an unpleasant feeling in the feet calves and thighs. rls caused by iron-deficiency anaemia can usually be treated with iron supplements. do hope this helps your problem. good luck"	what are the long term effects of having anemia?

hi the ph of your vagina can easily be upset from having your period engaging in sex and experiencing hormonal fluctuations can all upset the ph balance of your vagina as can birth control pills exercise feminine deodorants tampons pregnancy stress and soap. if not dealt with quick it could encourage a yeast infection. a ph imbalance and related infections can happen to anyone. your best defence is to maintain a healthy vaginal ph. here are some ways to do that. this requires nothing more than a healthy lifestyle and basic principles of hygiene. keep the area clean and dry. a regular bathing schedule including cleaning of the area with plain water is enough. after bathing dab the area with a dry towel. douching is actually harmful. it washes away the beneficial bacteria that stay in the vaginal region. this disturbs the vaginal ph and the area becomes prone to dryness and infections. similarly avoid the use of harsh soaps on the area. wear loose cotton based undergarments most of the time particularly at night times. they allow the area to breathe while you sleep. better still sleep naked if you can. being shaved also prevents a place for fungus to hide. one should prevent moisture getting trapped in the vaginal area. moistness predisposes to fungal infections. avoid excess of tea coffee and other carbonated drinks that directly influence the vaginal ph. too much of junk food is bad. processed food contains lots of salts preservatives that affects the flora of the region and hence the health. eat healthy. actually it is our diet that is the key point to have a healthy body including a healthy vagina. consume plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. drink plenty of water. fresh fruit juices and yoghurt are the best to restore back the vaginal ph. maintain hygiene in the area. always wipe off from front to back never the other way. change your sanitary napkins frequently. practice safe sex always. change condoms when required. avoid taking hormonal pills. hope something here helps your problem. good luck	vagina odor? . had unprotected sex on a saturday. then sunday started my period (2 weeks early) lasted until saturday. ran out of tampons on friday and bought a cheap brand - after inserting tampon i felt burning and cramping pain 2 hours after. took it out then sunday started having vagina odor its been three days now with odor and have cramping pain in pelvic area discharge seems normal. any ideas?

"yours is a common cry heard from women who tend to deposit their body fat in their abdominal area. first you are not obese. we have to keep these measurements in perspective. look at the other women on both sides of your family. do some of them have the same fat distribution? genetics does play a role. your waist size is very good at 30 inches but may seem to be large in your eyes because the rest of you is so much smaller in comparison. most women would love to have a 30-inch waist. just as an aside ask your gynecologist to check you for ovarian cysts. sometimes women have polycystic ovaries that lead to a greater abdominal fat distribution. there is a simple sonogram and blood test you would undergo. if you don't have this issue then you're left with your genetics. some women simply have more active fat storage enzyme in their abdominal area. others bemoan the fact that they have it mostly in their buttocks or thighs. everyone's different here. here are some tips to optimize your waistline: 1) watch out with overconsumption of alcohol. it tends to favor ab fat distribution. moderation please! 2) eating too many breads pastas and heavy complex carbs bloats most women esp in the ab area. 3) watch your posture. if you're tall (hey i'm 5'9"" so i know! ) and you stoop over that will make your tummy look large to you and the world. straighten up and practice good core power throughout the day. 4) speaking of core i would most definitely do a core program including pilates. you need to keep that long waist and back strong and toned. 5) try to keep your calories spread out over the day. eating too much late at night leads to a tummy hang in the morning."

a 9 pound infant is likely a very new baby. for a child of this age and size i would first check with the child’s pediatrician. acetaminophen is labeled for over-the-counter use in children 2 years of age or older. parents trying to treat a child this age should really talk to the pediatrician first. if the pediatrician says it is ok to give the child acetaminophen then we do need to consider the child’s weight in order to dose the product appropriately. tylenol infant’s and children’s products have recently been reformulated so that they now contain the same concentration of acetaminophen 160 mg/5 ml. however if you have an older package of tylenol (acetaminophen) at home then it may have a different strength. it is very important to know the product you are working with so that we give your child the correct amount. talk with your pediatrician or local pharmacist who can tell you the correct dose for your child based on weight and the product you have on hand. you will need to measure the correct amount with the dropper that is packaged with the product. your local pharmacist can help you use the device that you have so that the appropriate amount of medication is given to your child.	how much acetaminophen do you give a 9 pound infant?

what we know now is some great studies have been done within the last two years about the relationship between sleep and weight loss and weight gain. there are two hormones in particular that have specific amount to do with appetite. another thing we know about sleep deprivation is that your metabolism slows down. well if you have a slow metabolism you’re not burning fuel efficiently so it’s going into fat storage and fat deposits and again causing more weight gain. we also know with sleep deprivation we have increased levels of cortisol. well that can be another problem which causes more appetite. here’s the most fascinating part about the research i think. all those other things aside when you’re sleep deprived if i was to lay out a healthy snack for you or a very non healthy sugary snack for you you’d gun for the sugary food. you would go for the less healthy food so your food choice is even affected by sleep deprivation. how? they are not 100% sure how but that craving that you’re having seems to be more towards a comfort food which tends to be high carbohydrate high sugar high fat.	how can sleeping help me lose weight?
hi been off and found this. how does it effect blood pressure? viagra can slightly lower blood pressure. this is not a problem for most men. but viagra's effect on blood pressure is exaggerated if the viagra is taken with a nitrate drug. nitrates are one of the treatments doctors prescribe for angina. if you take viagra when you are also taking nitrates the combined effect of the viagra and the nitrates can lower your blood pressure to such an extent that it could prove fatal. never take viagra at the same time as taking nitrates. if i have a heart condition can i take it? if you have a heart condition it is important that you discuss this with the doctor before taking viagra. viagra may not be appropriate because of the danger of interacting with the nitrates. but i think your find if your low blood pressure is a naturally occurring thing then taken viagra would not do you any damage unless you was pushing the doses. but have you tried take l-arginine 1000mg and zinc to improve your erections. see if this helps you. good luck	how to treat erectile dysfunction with low blood pressure. . i. assume that viagra and cialis would not be recommended because they would lower my blood pressure even more? any ideas? note: my low pressure is just below normal and is stable and with no side effects.

"that's very interesting because vicodin (generic name is hydrocodone with acetaminophen) contains a narcotic that normally causes drowsiness. when a person reacts to a medication in the opposite way as expected it's called a ""paradoxical effect. "" some sleeping pills are well known for having a paradoxical effect on people keeping them wide awake all night long. in general experiencing a paradoxical effect from medication is nothing to be concerned about. it's not an allergy or anything like that. it just indicates your body responds differently to that particular medication. even if the hydrocodone controlled your pain you don't want to take a medication that causes you insomnia. you might consider scratching hydrocodone off your list and requesting a different prescription pain reliever the next time you need one. just let the doctor know how hydrocodone affects you. there are plenty of other narcotic pain relievers to choose from. wishing you well!"	i took vicodin for the first time post operatively for pain and it kept me awake at night. what is this called and why?
if the cough is caused by post-nasal drainage from your sinusitis you can try taking a long acting antihistamine (claritin or zyrtec) to dry up some of the drainage. cough can also be triggered by simple irriation so a teaspoonful of honey or glycerine-based cough drops may help. drink plenty of fluids and humidify the air you breathe at night (humidifier or vaporizer). if all fails you can try an otc cough suppressant like delsym or ask your medical provider for a prescription cough medication primarily at night.	i have a sinus infection and on antibodics but i have this constant dry cough-what can i do about the coughing?

get a second opinion from another urologist. a prostate biopsy is not a pleasant procedure so it should only be done if absolutely necessary. his psa is fine but the psa is not the definitive marker. i don't know his age or risk factors but if his prostate examination is normal. his psa is normal. i am puzzled by the recommendation. the urologist has a responsibility to justify this procedure so have a face-to-face consultation and hear has rationale. i know from personal experience the psa is a very questionable test designed to promote more tests and more expenses by the male populace. my psa is 10. 49. i have acute bacterial prostitus. this is treatable with powerful antibiotics. if you still have fear (that's what they want! ) then by all means have the dr. order a cat scan and then you will know the truth. j. ben my psa was 6-8 and had 2 biopsies no bumps no cancer but because my doctor did not like the signs he did a ( saturation biopsy) which then showed i had a gleason scale of t8 which at that point it starts spreading to the boney structures and lymph glands! the simple biopsy only hits a small part of the prostate. had he not been persistent and dependent upon my psa i would be planning my funeral. take this seriously! those who belittle the psa should have their tongues cut out.	my husbands urologist wants him to have a prostate biopsy. he has no lumps. psa was 1. 8. is this biopsy necessary? . what are the chances of cancer with a psa this low?

1. spend time in nature. sun exposure and natural light have been found to increase your mood. take a break during the day and be sure to step outside or go near a window to get your dose of mood-enhancing light. pay attention to the colors in nature when you’re outdoors. what sounds do you hear? looking around your environment with a fresh pair of eyes can be a very relaxing experience. 2. move your body. the current recommendations for physical activity call for sixty minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise daily. sound daunting? make it fun! go for a walk as a family turn on the radio and dance or practice yoga balance poses. movement activities positively affect health by reducing blood pressure enhancing mood and strengthening bones. 3. laugh. laughter really is the best medicine. take a moment to remember a situation that you found humorous. as you vividly recall the details you’ll probably find that a smile spontaneously develops. tell jokes make funny faces or start laughing and see who laughs with you. it can be contagious! 4. express yourself creatively. expressive art therapy enables you to share inner thoughts or feelings when they are difficult to articulate verbally. engaging in art activities such as finger painting drawing coloring etc. may relieve feelings of anxiety. 5. listen to music. there are many benefits to listening to music from relaxation to enhancing sleep. 6. take a warm bath. there are many historical references to the healing properties of water. ancient spas originated near mineral springs and seas and were used by natural healers to support health. establishing a bedtime routine that includes a warm bath in a quiet room can help to promote sleep and feelings of calm after a long day. run a warm bath light a few candles and close the door to spend some quality time with you. 7. aromatherapy. this refers to the use of essential oils to improve health and wellbeing. oils are delivered to the body through inhalation or direct application to the skin. lavender lemon balm and sandalwood are the two most common oils used to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. add a few drops to bath water or on a pillowcase. rub the oils between the palms of your hands and cup your hands to inhale a few deep breaths of the scent. use with caution if you have asthma or a skin condition associated with allergies. consult a physician before use. 8. gratitude journal. when we’re faced with life’s challenges we often see only the stressful situation and lose sight of all that we have to be thankful for in our lives. the next time life seems to hand you lemons try making lemonade by writing down ten things you appreciate in your life. it won’t eliminate the stress but you may find that it helps to improve your mood and shift your perspective allowing you to see new possibilities to resolve stressful situations. 9. gentle massage. human touch is very powerful and can be quite nurturing. use a lotion or light massage oil to rub the feet and/or hands. there are numerous “points” on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet that may influence various systems within the body. a gentle massage can be both relaxing and stimulating. use this technique to help quell stress when it appears. 10. mindful breathing. the mind has a tendency to wander. our thoughts pull us into the past replaying moments that we can’t recover or push us into the future as we worry about what has yet to come. the body is always in the present moment. noticing your breathing on purpose without feeling the need to change it brings us back to the present moment. it serves as an anchor. take a “time-out” to notice your breathing when you feel stressed or worried and pay attention to how your body feels.	what are some healthy ways to help me manage my stress levels?

it sounds like you are doing what you need to do in terms of dealing with stress including meditation but it might take time to see results. i suggest taking a closer look at your diet to make sure you are eating filling foods. what is your dinner meal like? foods that increase satiety or feeling of fullness tend to be rich in protein and fiber. so a lean protein source (lean meat or beans) with fruits and veggies whole grains and healthy fats work well. also if you crave sweets but aren't allowing yourself any that may be increasing your cravings. try including sensible amounts on a reglar basis. ideas include dark chocolate or small amounts of your favorite treat. also make sure you eat a hearty breakfast and lunch as smaller meals earlier in the day tend to increase hunger later in the day. a mindful or intuitive eating style may be helpful to you. there are a variety of books on the subject that can help. good luck!	i have elevated cortisol levels. how can i keep my weight in check? . i am eating 3 meals with snacks but my hunger soars around 9 pm as does my energy. its hard to fall asleep. i do exercise regularly but that's during the day. i have reduced my external stress and am meditating. i do not do caffeine or alcohol.

yes you are absolutely putting yourself at risk for serious health complications if you haven’t already. simply put your body is not receiving the nutrients that it needs to maintain its normal biological processes and function. consuming only tea with sugar would not be providing your body with an adequate amount of protein/essential amino acids essential fatty acids carbohydrates vitamins and minerals that your body needs for proper maintenance. these nutrient deficiencies can lead to serious health problems. i would suggest speaking with a doctor or registered dietitian and consider amending your diet immediately.	i am 5ft 2 i havnt eaten for 88 days but drink only tea with 1 sugar how much harm am i putting my body and brain in

you know that is a good question. let me start off with this. the question of the medium complected person the olive skinned patient that has perhaps brown eyes what do we do for them because i’ve stated that they are not the perfect candidate. well there are people who kind of fall into you’re probably okay type department. what we do there is rather than guess what the result would be we do what we call a patch test or a demo. we take a little bit of the chemical we put it on the skin of the forehead usually under where the hair would conceal it and we test the skin kind of like paint companies test paint put it out in the sun for a few months. we’re going to see how that skin behaves and we’re going to see what the end color is. now we may have to wait 3 to 6 months. it may take that long for the pink color to fade and for the skin to get to the ultimate color it’s going to be. most of the time it’ll be lighter but in some people it could be darker and we’d like to know that. now it’s a color issue for these people. it’s not an issue of a greater chance of other serious complications like scarring or the white bumps it’s strictly the color. but that is important because people would like to have uniform color and natural look. but we also have to remind that patient that since most people’s skin will lighten up a little bit if they have a reasonable amount of pigment then there’s a potential color difference between the treated face and the untreated neck. now that can be concealed with makeup and not necessarily heavy makeup but the patient needs to know that going in because there are some women for example who say but i don’t ever wear makeup and i don’t want to wear makeup and if i’m going to look like i’ve got a color difference then maybe this isn’t for me and i agree it isn’t for them. but if we can show them by the patch test the sample test the demo what the outcome will be then they can make a better decision. we still have to deal with the patient who has some darkness and increased darkness from sun damage and there are less intense ways to deal with even if a patient does develop pigmentation because perhaps they went out in the sun a little too soon or perhaps they went water skiing and washed off their sunscreen we do have bleach creams that are very effective within 4 to 6 weeks when applied once a day will bleach out that pigment. really? yeah not the extent of michael jackson bleach but to get us back to the baseline. yes we have some wonderful products that are available today all basically from good research.	is there a way an olive skin person can have a chemical peel?

the flu vaccine is safe and recommended for breastfeeding moms. the vaccine is not passed through to the baby and therefore no direct flu immunity is passed to the baby either. the rationale for encouraging parents to get the flu vaccine is that if a parent develops immunity and becomes less likely to catch the flu then he/she is less likely to pass the flu to their baby.	is the flu vaccine safe for breastfeeding moms?
running certainly does burn lots of calories and if you're running regularly you might decide not to eat as much figuring why do it if you're putting all that energy into running. but even if you ran a marathon every day you wouldn't lose weight unless you consumed fewer calories than you burned. the bottom line to losing weight is burning more calories than you consume no matter how much exercise you do. running is a great way to expend calories and boost your metabolism to promote weight loss. however i would recommend slowly and gradually building up your exercise routine to jogging. start out by walking and then gradually add more days per week or time per session. you can also try walking with intermittent bouts of jogging. eventually you can build up to where you are doing mostly jogging instead of walking. from there you can work on increasing how long you jog or your speed while jogging. a couch to 5k program might provide good direction on how to gradually transition from walking to jogging. it’s important to start a routine in this slow and gradual fashion to allow your body time to acclimate and adjust to your exercise routine and to avoid any injury. if you are considerably overweight it might be best to refrain from jogging altogether until you lose weight. the extra weight can put a high demand on your joints while jogging since it is more of a high impact exercise.	will running help me lose weight?

i can't answer that question since i don't know your symptoms have the ability to examine you or see those test results. i can tell you that about half of the women (i am also assuming you are a female) who have symptoms of a uti do not have them. many will have urethral irritation (usually from sexual activity) or even a vaginal infection. the culture is much more accurate than the rapid urine test so follow your instructions and see your medical provider again if you are not getting better.	the doctors did a rapid test to see if i had an uti and it came back positivebut the culture came back negitive. i went to the doctors on friday night and they did a rapid test to see if i had an uti and it came back positive. today i got a call saying the urinalysis came back negative and that i should follow up with my doctor and to continue to take the antibiotics they prescribed to me. what else could i have if the culture came back negative? what does that mean?

caffeine can increase the blood pressure but the effect usually only lasts for a short time. experts have yet to make a strong link between caffeine and long term high blood pressure. that being said a lot of doctors tell patients that have high blood pressure or heart disease that they should limit their caffeine. a boost even a temporary one in blood pressure may not be a good idea on top of already high blood pressure. besides coffee caffeine is found in tea energy drinks soft drinks and even in chocolate. some headache/pain medicines also have caffeine in them. your daughter-in-law should let her doctor know how much coffee she drinks as well as other sources of caffeine in her day. too much caffeine is often a cause of sleep problems or can make existing sleep problems even worse. hope this helps!	is there a relationship between excessice coffee drinking and high blood pressure? . my daughter-in-law makes 5-6 pots of coffee daily. she has high blood pressure and gets headaches. is she drinking too much coffee that would cause the elevation in blood pressure? she also takes a lot of prescription pain medicine and a sleep medication.

social support is defined as the sum of all the relationships that make you feel as if you matter to the people who matter to you. studies have verified that a strong group of family members and close friends or a support system (doctors nurses other health care professionals) can help in coping with a chronic illness. in some cases having a strong social network is associated with greater compliance with medication regimens and the use of health services. when you are tied emotionally to those in your social network you can express your innermost feelings of fear insecurity and guilt and receive comfort from people who accept you -- just as you are -- with no strings attached. if you have no place that feels safe enough to let down your emotional defenses you may tend to keep your guard up all the time -- a negative cynical and sometimes defensive guard that masks the very problems you are facing. with increased social support you can alleviate the emotional distress of living with psoriatic arthritis and gain health benefits such as the following: greater sense of control. while you may have no control over your psoriatic arthritis having a group of supportive family members and friends is something you can control. greater resilience. through positive feedback and support from friends and family you can learn to buffer life's interruptions with effective coping skills instead of letting the moment's crisis overwhelm you. longevity. in study after study the findings are the same: people with many social contacts -- a spouse a close-knit family a network of friends religious or other group affiliations -- lived longer and had better health. those who had few ties with other people died at rates two to five times higher than those with good social ties. if your psoriatic arthritis has led to high anxiety isolation increased stress or depression talk to your doctor or a licensed mental health counselor. seeking help early on can help you avoid more serious problems associated with other mood disorders and chronic illnesses.	why is social support important with psoriatic arthritis?
taking multivitamins during pregnancy is extremely important for proper fetus growth and development. the rda has recommended values of how much of each vitamin and mineral is recommended during pregnancy. there are many brands available on the market as prescription strength and over-the-counter. some are more tailored toward specific women lacking different components than others. a more expensive vitamin is not necessarily better than others. work with your ob-gyn to help select a vitamin that will work best for you. size and cost can play a role in the selection process more importantly to aid in compliance. avoid taking several different supplements. take one multivitamin that includes a variety of necessary nutrients in one dose. combining supplements (such as taking a folic acid supplement along with your multivitamin etc. ) can raise concerns because you run the risk of overdosing on a particular nutrient. taking more than twice the rda of any nutrient should be avoided during pregnancy.	what are the best vitamins for a pregnant woman?

it's starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot. in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast. i don’t always do well with things that are slow. however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you don’t have to think about it again until it’s time to eat. here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock-pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush. the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients. this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat. these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken. (by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats. so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that — or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat. ). when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily. and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone. if you’ve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely you’ve participated in the biggest mistake: do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker. period. ever. using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie. canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can. cooking them for another 6-8 hours will disintegrate them. potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker. using canned tomatoes is fine — mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well. absolute no-nos: canned green beans canned corn and canned peas. actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it. under-seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time. since the food is cooking there for so long — the equivalent of a long slow boil — there needs to be a few levels of flavors. there are a couple ways to do this. if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest sautéing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot. the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step. also add fresh-cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly. add ingredients that are high in flavor. for example fire-roasted tomatoes or fire-roasted chilies. another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat. a half piece of bacon has about 1. 5 grams of fat depending on the size. not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor. can you tell i’m a fan of bacon? here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup. take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken. for every four cups of water throw in a 1-2 inch piece of ginger root and about 4 whole garlic cloves. then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high. at the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon. the slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldn’t experience if it was cooked quickly. and not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone. you can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast. throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night. you can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots — these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor. yes it’s slow but worth the wait. enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us. i want to see crock pot what it looks like most foods that are cooked in hard bottom in covered pot can be cooked fast with high heat according the type of food	how can my crock pot help me make fast healthy food?
well there seem to be fairly instant physiological effects in terms of blood lipid levels and potential inflammation in the arteries after we eat a super high saturated fat meal so i would try to direct someone to “cheat” responsibly. in other words even when we are “cheating ” we can make better choices. like a guy is having his favorite steak and potato meal from a restaurant. try to choose a leaner cut of steak (filet mignon top sirloin or london broil for example) and try to keep the amount of steak eaten within 6 ounces or so (take the rest of the 12- or 16-ounce steak home for sandwiches the next day). he might be more satisfied with this smaller portion of steak if he has enjoyed a broth- or tomato-based cup of soup and/or a nice green salad with a vinaigrette dressing – before he gets to the steak. .	if i have heart disease or high blood pressure is it okay to splurge on my diet one night?

hi ok why do you think they call it a birth control injection? it stops you getting pregnant that's why that's the whole idea of it so if its depo shot just google it and away you go all the answers you need. but do google depo shot side effects lots of info on it side effects some you may not know about. if i remember right its like 99% safe and that's about as good as it gets unless you just stick to oral sex so now is the time to enjoy your sex life you can go all the way and let your b/f ejeculate inside you without fear of getting pregnant your b/f will now enjoy his sex life with you us men do not like withdrawing at the point of ejaculation and your now should be able to feel him pumping into you its all apart of the sex act. do hope this helps you. good luck ps don't forget every 12 weeks get your next shot.	birth control shots: can i get pregnant if he ejaculates? . i have been sexually active with my boyfriend for about 3 months now. i just recently started using a birth control shot. my father who is a doctor distributed it to me and told me that it would take a about a week for it to kick in. but. i was too embarrassed to ask him if the birth control shot was powerful enough to stop pregnancy even with ejaculation. i'm just wondering you know in case my boyfriend doesn't pull out in time.

it sounds like you may have had some kind of allergic reaction to an ingredient in the shampoo. normally when someone uses a product and develops symptoms that go away when they stop using the product it means an ingredient in the product was the cause of their symptoms. it may not have been the keratin at all. shampoos contain a wide variety of ingredients from perfumes to dyes. it's possible your scalp really didn't like one of the components of that particular shampoo's formula. all that said i admit i don't know anything about keratin treatments specifically. however i certainly would be hesitant to undergo any treatment with a reputation for making people's hair fall out! take care!	why would keratin shampoo make my hair fall out? as soon as i quit using it it stopped. . i would like to get a keratin smoothing treatment but i've read similar stories where people lost their hair to the point of having bald spots. breakage i could understand but my hair fell out at the root. it doesn't make any sense.
get the finger in ice water. if the accumulation of blood is under the nail (subungual hematoma) then it may need to be drained. a hole is bored through the nail (not as bad as it sounds) to allow the blood to be released. the pressure of the accumulated blood is painful so this procedure relieves a lot of pain. if the blood accumulation is in the soft tissue of the finger it cannot be drained. it will need to be slowly reabsorbed by the body. if you think the injury could of resulted in a fracture only an x-ray could confirm this.	my husband closed his finger in the door it is swollen and has a blood clot what should we do?

aerobic exercise and resistance training are both beneficial for diabetes and lower the hemoglobin a1c levels. structured exercise programs typically produce better results than “exercise advice” simply because the structured exercise programs achieve greater intensity and duration and greater compliance than when patients are left to their own devices to get the recommended exercise. in fact studies with “exercise advice” typically produced no improvement in the hemoglobin a1c (due to poor compliance) unless dietary improvements were also made. the best combination is always simultaneous dietary improvement plus exercise (cardio and/or resistance) and the more “structured” or “formalized” the better. in fact while patients who achieve the standard recommended “2. 5 hours per week” see greater improvements in hemoglobin a1c than those who do not meet this standard; those patients who exceed the standard get even greater improvements!	what kind of exercise is beneficial for people with diabetes?

you can see a rebound weight gain with any of the stimulants but it really happens for a short time and doesn't usually continue indefinitely. on the other hand we have seen compulsive binge eating in those with untreated adhd. eating disorders are common in adhd and are the result of untreated symptoms of impulsivity and distractibility. stimulants not only decrease appetite but also decrease the urge to binge in these cases.	i took adderall for nine years but quit because of the side effects. now i'm gaining weight like crazy. what can i do?

this is a difficult question to answer. compounding used to be more popular than it is now. pharmacists were trained to compound in school and any nearly pharmacist could prepare medication for you in this way. now many pharmacy schools have compounding training available but do not require the course. a compounded medication is a product that a pharmacist makes on an individual basis because it is not commercially provided. pharmacists need to make sure the ingredients can remain stable in the mixture and that they will provide proper treatment for the patient’s condition. recipes for compounds are not standard so sometimes the pharmacist has to conduct research to obtain a recipe for the compounded medication that your physician has prescribed. many chain pharmacies do not have pharmacist that are trained to compound. if you need a compounded prescription they should be able to direct you to another pharmacy to suit your need there are community pharmacies available that specialize in compounding. but you want to do some research. check with your local children’s hospital to see if they have an outpatient pharmacy that will fill your prescription. if they do not see if they can recommend a local pharmacy that is able to compound the medication for you.	is every pharmacy able to compound medications for my child?

for common skin warts many dermatologists agree that it’s perfectly fine to try over-the-counter wart treatments for a couple of months. if your warts don’t go away during that time or if they get worse it may be wise to seek medical attention. dermatologists have a variety of wart treatment and removal techniques that are stronger and work faster than commercially available products. also remember that all warts can be “mother” warts that give rise to additional warts in your skin. so the faster you remove the wart the less likely it will spread.	when do you need to see a doctor about warts?

vitamin d is not given for weight loss but it is common for people with excess weight to have low vitamin d levels. a doctor may prescribe very high levels to bring levels back up. it is not recommended for someone to give themselves more than the tolerable upper limit of vitamin d (4 000iu) unless prescribed by a doctor. although toxicity is rare it can occur causing increased calcium levels in the blood. for more on vitamin d supplementation see this article.	i read an artical that said you can take more than 10 000iu of vitamin d3 for weight lose. is that true? health risks?
pre-participation sports evaluations are a hot topic – despite the growing data in support of testing we still have not collectively agreed on the best way to screen young people. many are familiar with the italian experience of screening all young athletes with electrocardiograms – this practice has diagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other conditions and likely has prevented many deaths. but a limitation of screening many people for less common conditions is that some people without underlying heart conditions may have abnormal electrocardiograms leading to more expensive testing. and given limited resources we unfortunately must consider both benefit and cost. some have argued that sudden death from undiagnosed cardiac conditions is so uncommon that we frankly can’t afford to screen everyone. but recent research may suggest that screening with electrocardiograms may be cost-effective according to commonly accepted thresholds. one of my good friends from cardiology fellowship euan ashley who heads the stanford hypertrophic cardiomyopathy center recently published an article which directly addresses the question of whether screening athletes with electrocardiograms in addition to a medical history and physical exam is cost-effective as compared to a history and physical alone. cost-effectiveness is typically judged in terms of cost per life-year saved. euan and his team found that adding electrocardiograms to a screening program saved approximately 2. 1 life-years per 1000 people tested at an additional cost of about $89 dollars per athlete. this suggests a cost-effectiveness ratio of about $43 000 per life-year saved. in general procedures are felt to be cost-effective if they cost less than $50 000 per life-year saved. to give some perspective hemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease has a ratio that falls in the range of approximately $50 000. scientific data can guide us but it doesn’t help balance our budgets. while we might find that a given procedure treatment or screening test may be cost-effective by standard definitions that still doesn’t mean that we have the money to do it. and it is unlikely that we will stop paying for previously accepted procedures in favor of others that may be cheaper. electrocardiograms and kidney dialysis are apples and oranges. but the data does raise questions moving forward. given limited resources who should be entitled to potentially life-saving cardiac screening? the nfl nba and increasingly mls have access to some of the best medical care around. it is my hope that if we get our act together with regards to screening our professional athletes appropriately than perhaps we can focus the conversation on our sons and daughters who i would love to see screened on a more consistent basis in the future.	should young athletes be screened for heart conditions?

1. taking the time to cook your family’s meals is probably the most important step to cutting back on the salt. processed and prepared foods usually contain substantially more salt than you’d ever add to your home prepared meals. 2. buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables. if you buy canned look for “no salt added” on the label. 3. choose alternate seasonings to flavor your food. if you use a seasoning blend select one that is salt-free. 4. be a label reader. salt will be listed as “sodium. ” select items that contain 5% of less of your daily salt intake. steer clear of food items that contain 20% or more of your daily salt intake! 5. look for hidden sources of salt: salad dressing canned soup/broth and packaged mixes. 6. love sushi? pick low-salt soy sauce (it usually has a green top). 7. avoid or limit high-salt meats - those that are smoked cured or processed. 8. don’t put the salt shaker on the kitchen table.	what are some ways i can cut back on my family's salt intake?
all liquids can help to you to stay hydrated. water is the best choice because it does not have sugar or calories. most people can get enough fluid through water fruit juices coffee iced tea soda and other drinks. you can also get water through food such as fruits and vegetables like watermelon and lettuce. most healthy adults should drink six to eight 8-ounces glass of water or other fluid daily. some adults may need more depending on amount of exercise their health and how hot and dry the climate is. for more information on water please click here.	water is very important are there any other beverages that can substitute for plain water such as green tea etc.

these innocent little red areas are called subconjunctival hemorrhages. they are just tiny little bruises from ruptured blood vessels. they appear bright red in the eye because the conjunctiva is crystal clear and easy to see. if these hemorrhage occurred on your skin they will be just a tiny bruise and go unnoticed. blood vessels can rupture for many reasons but the most common cause of these would be straining. straining to lift something straining at work or even straining to have a bowel movement. i saw a new mother a few days ago and both her eyes were bright red from hemorrhages. she had quite a strain delivering a 10 pound baby a few days prior! people who take aspirin or other blood-thinning medications tend to have more of these conjunctival hemorrhages. if you are bruising in other areas not just your eyes it would be wise to consult your medical provider.	i frequenly get blood vesels breaking in my eye causing white area to be bright red what is the cause? . it starts with what looks like a pin hole gets worse and can last over a week.

"just as you wouldn't (or at least you shouldn't) train the same body part everyday you shouldn't train your abs everyday. your abs like other body parts need time to recover. it's during the recovery phase where your muscles grow stronger preparing them for even better performance on the next ab workout. instead give your abs 48 hours in between workouts to recover and strengthen. and remember to hit each of your major ab areas in every ab workout. this includes the upper abs lower abs obliques and transverse abdominal muscles. many exercises can hit all the muscle groups at the same time giving you a great ab workout in less time. examples of all-ab exercises include bicycle crunches and stability ball knee tucks. also don't be afraid of using weights for some ab exercises. resistance helps build stronger more toned muscles. that's not going to give you a big belly from bulging ab muscles. they don't grow like that. and remember that your abs are never going to pop unless you burn off the fat. it's a common misconception that the way to six-pack abs is ab work. actually burning the fat through a well-rounded exercise program that includes cardio weight training stretching and ab work is the key to six-pack abs. also incorporate core movements that work the abs as well as the rest of the core from your chest to your butt. no no. do abs 3 days a week with a non-abs day in between. the p90x ab ripper program is designed to be done every mon wed and friday. and he recommends not trying to do it every day. your muscles need time to repair themselvs. overtraining ""when you do abdominal workouts every day you risk overtraining your muscles. when you overtrain you experience a reduced synthesis of muscle proteins along with an increased rate of protein degradation in your muscles notes peter m. tiidus author of ""skeletal muscle damage and repair.

sometimes doctors can find the cause of a couple's infertility by doing a complete fertility evaluation. this process usually begins with physical exams and health and sexual histories. if there are no obvious problems like poorly timed intercourse or absence of ovulation tests will be needed. for a man doctors usually begin by testing his semen. they look at the number shape and movement of the sperm. sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones. for a woman the first step in testing is to find out if she is ovulating each month. there are several ways to do this at home or doctors can also check if a woman is ovulating by doing blood tests and an ultrasound of the ovaries. if the woman is ovulating normally more tests are needed. some common tests of fertility in women include: hysterosalpingography: in this test doctors use x-rays to check for physical problems of the uterus and fallopian tubes. laparoscopy: during this surgery doctors use a tool called a laparoscope to see inside the abdomen. using the laparoscope doctors check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems. doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy.	how will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?

for vitamin b-12 and folate deficiency anemia the treatment depends on the cause of the deficiency. if your body stores are depleted of vitamin b-12 your doctor will most likely prescribe vitamin b-12 injections and may also recommend high doses of b-12 supplements or a b-12 nasal spray. there is a good chance that many of the symptoms of deficiency will improve once the body is provided with the needed b-12. most people with vitamin b-12 deficiency have a permanent inability to absorb vitamin b-12 and will need injections every one to three months or pills daily for the rest of their lives. some forms of gastric bypass surgery are associated with deficiencies of iron vitamin b12 and other nutrients typically absorbed in the part of the stomach that is bypassed. your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of vitamin b-12 in your diet. good dietary sources of vitamin b-12 are meat liver and kidney; fish oysters and clams; and milk cheese and eggs. if you have a folate deficiency your doctor will prescribe folate supplements and may recommend you increase the amount of folate in your diet. good dietary sources of folate include fresh fruits green leafy vegetables cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower broccoli and brussel sprouts) liver and kidney dairy products and whole grain cereals. vegetables should be eaten raw or lightly cooked.	how are vitamin b-12 and folate deficiency anemia treated?

the infection is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). after hiv is in the body it attacks and destroys cd4+ cells which are the part of the body's immune system that fights infection and disease. when hiv weakens or destroys the immune cells it may lead to certain illnesses or diseases such as some types of pneumonia or cancer that are more likely to develop in someone who has a weakened immune system. these conditions are a sign that hiv has progressed to aids. hiv is spread when blood semen or vaginal fluids from an infected person enter another person's body usually through sexual contact from sharing needles when injecting drugs or from mother to baby during birth. hiv is rarely spread by blood transfusions or organ transplants in the united states because of improved screening procedures. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection?

i have long loved the flavor and versatility of mushrooms in cooking. i was even more thrilled with these fungi (aka fun guy) when i learned of the great nutritional benefits. mushrooms have long been studied as antioxidants — literally books can be written on their nutritional benefits. suffice it to say that when it’s raining or snowing outside there is something beyond “comfort” in a bowl of mushroom soup! not only are mushrooms packed with nutrients incredible antioxidants low-cal fat-free and cholesterol-free they are delicious! my “go to” mushroom is a crimini aka baby bella (small portabellos). they look like the white button varieties but they are brown. they have an earthy flavor and are great in everything from salads to soups to pastas to chicken or meat dishes. you can buy them loose in bulk or already sliced for you. simply slice them thin and sauté them in a bit of extra virgin olive oil and garlic with a splash of soy sauce. the water will start to cook out of the mushrooms and you can add to a grilled chicken breast or a burger or piece of fish. by adding chopped fresh cilantro or basil at the end you can even further expand the flavors. if you are using dried mushrooms look for one that has some porcini in it. the flavor is so intense and can elevate the flavors of a recipe instantly. shiitake mushrooms are another favorite of mine. they have a distinct flavor that goes well with asian dishes. i would use a shiitake in a noodle dish that has veggies ginger garlic and soy. they are also great roasted whole and tossed with just a bit of extra virgin olive oil soy sauce and sesame seeds. then top on a steak or serve with wilted spinach as a side dish. i would not use shiitakes in an italian-style dish that has butter or cream.	do mushrooms have nutritional value? which taste the best?

"it would be highly unlikely to transmit chlamydia from a toilet seat (unless there was fresh discharge on the seat itself) and next to impossible through a bath. i don't know if you are male or female but why do you have chlamydia? this is a very treatable infectious disease. one you have been properly treated and tested ""negative"" at the end of the treatment you no longer have chlamydia and cannot transmit it to anyone. chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomatis. the infection spreads through vaginal. anal or oral sex and not by touching or sharing surfaces like toilet seats or baths. very rarely if body secretions of infected person come in immediate and direct contact with mucous membrane of other persons chlamydia may get transmitted. chlamydia can be effectively treated with antibiotics."	can u transmitt chlamydia thru sharing a toilet or sharing a bath? my child often bathe with me.

"my best answer is: you should not discontinue simvastatin without consulting your physician. a stress test alone cannot tell you there is ""no build up"" of plaque in your arteries. i'm glad your stress test result was good but your total cholesterol number is a bit high. it's not outrageous though and that fact warrants a discussion with your physician. if your health care provider feels you need to be on a cholesterol-lowering drug there are many alternatives to simvastatin. your provider can advise you how to discontinue the simvastatin and start a new medication if needed. you might also check out webmd's heart disease community to see how others have handled their borderline high cholesterol issues what medications they take and how they talked to their doctor about their choices of cholesterol-lowering drugs. take care!"	how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. .

this is a great question. when patients come in or consumers and ask me about heartburn as a pharmacist i have to ask them a few questions to find out what kind of heartburn are they having. for instance if they are having heartburn at night they really need to see a physician. i need to find out how frequently they are having their heartburn. if they are having it everyday or is it only one or two times a week? then i need to ask them some questions about their diet because what they may not understand is that diet caffeine acidic foods even smoking could lead to heartburn. then i will look at them and say okay are they taking any other medications? my elderly patients hopefully they have their medication list with them. i will be able to take a look and see what's appropriate for them. there are a variety of different products that are available. if it's just something for quick relief then you could use like an antacid like a maalox or a tums something along those lines. if it's something that maybe needs a little bit more consistency then we can go more towards a pepcid type of product which works a little differently by cutting down on the amount of acid in the stomach. if they complain that they have had it more frequently during the day for a number of days then the choice might be something like prilosec otc which they are going to take for about 14 days. if they come back to the pharmacy after that and the 14 days and it hasn't worked then i am going refer them back to their physician or their healthcare provider for further evaluation.	how do i choose an over-the-counter heartburn medication?
this question is complicated to answer because the protein requirement change based on age but here are some recommendations below. the dietary reference intake for protein is calculated using the guideline of 0. 8 grams of protein per kilogram body weight which are the recommendations below. adult men need about 56 grams a day. adult women need about 46 grams a day. you can also calculate your protein needs based on the percentage of calories a day. the protein should consist of 10% and no more than 35% of calories from protein. choosing the right kinds of protein will be most important as most adults consume enough grams of protein a day. this link can give you suggestions on foods that contain protein and this link gives the full protein recommendations. 17	"45 year old male. how much protein should i have a day? . i am a 45 year old male 5'10"" 236lbs large frame. i had lower back surgery. i go to the gym and use the recumbent bike 6 days a week 10 to 13 miles a day and strength train (all elliptical) 6 days. i do low impact aerobics m-w-f 60mins. i was told by a huge body builder that i should be taking in 1g of protein pr 1lb of body weight. i want to loss weight and get power back. i'm not looking to be a body builder. should i take in 1g per lb? and if so should it go down as my weight goes down?"

there’s a new fascinating study that suggests rocking does indeed have an effect on our ability to fall asleep as well as on the quality of the sleep itself. researchers at the university of geneva switzerland tested the effects of rocking on sleep in a dozen adult men between the ages of 22-38. all the men involved were good sleepers — none were suffering from any sleep or anxiety disorders and they were well rested at the time of the experiment. researchers created a special bed that mimicked the rocking of a hammock and had the men take two 45-minute naps. during one nap the bed gently rocked and during the other nap the bed remained still. while their subjects slept researchers measured brain activity using an electroencephalogram (eeg). here’s what they found: every one of the participants fell asleep more quickly during their rocking nap. a majority (8 of 12) said they found the rocking nap “more pleasant” than the nap on the stationary bed. during the rocking nap all of the sleepers moved more quickly from stage one to t stage two of their sleep cycle. stage two is where we typically spend half of our sleep time over the course of a night. while rocking sleepers showed significant increases in the types of brain-wave activity that are specifically associated with deeper more restful and more continuous sleep.	does rocking help make it easier to fall asleep?

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. gastroenteritis is no fun! of course i'm obligated to tell you that smoking marijuana is illegal except in states that allow medical marijuana usage and then only with a valid prescription. so i can't really comment on the effect of marijuana on symptoms of gastroenteritis other than to say the medical community really doesn't know the effect of marijuana on many conditions because the substance hasn't been studied all that much. as to your gastroenteritis you need to be aware it is contagious. if you work in a food-handling environment for example you should not return to work. if necessary have your manager speak to your doctor to explain why it's a bad idea for you to return to work until your gastroenteritis has completely cleared up. if you insist on going back to work it's imperative you wash your hands frequently with warm soapy water. do not share eating utensils towels or other objects with co-workers. disinfect all food preparation areas and surfaces you touch frequently. it would be a good idea for you to inform your co-workers about the gastroenteritis so they can join with you in washing their hands frequently in order to avoid transmitting this illness among the staff and customers. i hope you feel better soon!	will smoking marijuana worsen symptoms of gastroenteritus? . this is my second day. been to the hospital twice 1st for nonstop vomiting & dhiarrea. was treated with two i. v's and sent home with zofran for nausea. second time for worsening abdominal cramping over a 8 hour period. and i did smoke a small bowl before i went to sleep. i have to go back to work tomorrow or i will loose my job but i don't know if i am well enough yet.
well the baby can be comparitively smaller but not necessarily dwarf. but for confirmation amniocentesis can be done. baby measuring less than 18 inches at birth is generally considered to be having some skeletal dysplasia. so you need to discuss with your gynaecologist who can check for factors like head size amniotic fluid around baby along with limb size and can also discuss about amniocentesis to proceed further. hope this helps.

your baby either has a cold (viral infection) or is teething. or both. babies often have a difficult time dealing with drainage either saliva or mucous when they are lying flat so a cough is important to clear their airway. coughing can certainly be a sign of something more serious (bronchiolitis rsv pneumonia etc. ) because your baby is immunocompromised due to age so it would be best to have a medical provider listen to those little lungs. there is very little you can do at this age to control a cough but you can make it easier for them to swallow excess mucous by using a cool mist humidifier in the room and sucking out nasal mucous using a special bulb syringe. a drop of saline in each nostril just prior to aspirating it will help loosen any thick mucous.	my 9 month old baby is coughing really hard while sleeping

surgery for prostatitis may be necessary to treat chronic bacterial prostatitis that does not respond to long-term antibiotic treatment and that causes repeated urinary tract infections. surgery may be done to remove part of the prostate or to remove infected prostate stones ( prostatic calculi ). however this does not always cure the infection and it may make the symptoms worse. surgery is generally done only if all other treatments have failed. surgery choices surgical removal of part of the prostate to treat an infection that does not respond to antibiotic treatment or to remove prostate stones is called transurethral prostatectomy. what to think about removing prostate stones may not cure prostatitis because the surgery may not remove the portion of the prostate containing the stones. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for prostatitis?
if you're past the age of puberty you should have this situation checked out by a urologist. normally during sexual arousal the prostate gland fills with fluid. this helps keep the neck of the urinary bladder tightly closed so that no urine leaks out during ejaculation. in pubescent boys before all the internal male reproductive structures have matured it's not uncommon for urine leakage to occur with ejaculation. after these structures have fully matured you shouldn't have that problem. if you do like i said you should see a urologist. this is not an emergency situation but it's certainly something you should have checked. you don't want to take chances with your reproductive health. wishing you all the best!	as a man why do i have urine instead of semen for ejaculations?

the mainstay of treatments are still oral and or topical antibiotics along with benzoyl peroxide washes and topical retinoids. in severe cases a type of surgery called marsupialization can be done to more definitively treat the condition; however there is often scarring from the procedure so it is often reserved for the worst cases. oral isotretinoin is also used with some benefit in getting the condition under control; however topical treatments are needed to maintain clearance over time.	i have had hidradenitis. are there any new treatments?

i'm sorry to hear what you went through. mrsa can be a very nasty bug indeed. as you probably know (but for the benefit of others reading this response) mrsa stands for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureas. this bacterium is resistant to treatment by many antibiotics. thankfully vancomycin still works to kill it. i understand your concern about the infection coming back. you are not being paranoid in thinking this way. usually the iv vancomycin treatment completely eradicates the bug but not always. here are things you should watch for: fever over 101. 3f localized heat in any joint but especially on the finger or hand where the mrsa originally was colonized localized swelling especially on the originally affected hand swollen hot angry red tissue -- especially on the originally affected hand any of those signs should send you quickly back to your treating physician. while i noted you should mainly focus your attention on the hand that was originally infected don't ignore other limbs. basically if you get any weird symptoms -- whether around your knee or in the opposite arm or whatever -- you should check back with your healthcare provider. also if your physician agrees it wouldn't hurt to have your sed (sedimentation) rate monitored for awhile. this blood test basically measures inflammation in your body. people with a serious infection like mrsa have an elevated sed rate. in some people who have had mrsa the sed rate remains elevated for a long time and it's nothing to worry about. but it's a test infectious disease professionals routinely look at in people who have or had mrsa. chances are you will never have a problem with mrsa again but you're wise to stay vigilant for awhile. and if you ever decide to have joint replacement surgery pacemaker implantation or any surgery that puts hardware into your body be sure to mention your mrsa history to your surgeon. wishing you well!	i had mrsa that penetrated bone in what ways will mrsa reapear what do i look for to prevent another serious ocurance? . bone infection was removed from finger. underwent surgery and 6 weeks of vancomycin iv treatment. i am an otherwise very healthy 32 yr old woman.

whether or not you should use medicine during pregnancy is a serious question to discuss with your doctor. some health problems need treatment. not using a medicine that you need could harm you and your baby. for example a urinary tract infection (uti) that is not treated may become a kidney infection. kidney infections can cause preterm labor and low birth weight. an antibiotic is needed to get rid of a uti. ask your doctor whether the benefits of taking a certain medicine outweigh the risks for you and your baby.	can i take medicine if i get sick while i am pregnant?
no urinary tract infections are not contagious. a person with a bacterial infection in their urinary tract could indeed transfer these bacteria to a vagina during sexual intercourse but it would be highly unlikely for the exposed person to get a urinary tract infection for this alone. with that said you can develop a urinary tract infection on your own from sexual activity. as a matter of fact this is listed as one of the most common causes. in most cases it your own bacteria -- bacteria from your colon and rectal area -- that become contaminated or colonized in your vaginal area that gets transferred into your urethra/bladder during sexual activity.	are urinary tract infections contagious. my boyfriend has a kidney stone and had a lithotripsy done to break it up. they inserted a stent and it has been there for a few months. during which we had sex and he was given an rx for a u. t. i. but didn't take it. i want to see if he does have a u. t. i. could it be contagious or can it cause any other complications for me?

it starts with communication with your doctor and pharmacist. make sure you know why you are taking all of your medications. this way you can try to minimize redundancy. ask your doctor for recommendations regarding when to take each medication – it might make sense to take your “water pill” earlier in the day so you aren’t woken up at night by the urge to go the bathroom. ask you doctor if routine liver or kidney laboratory testing is appropriate. bring your medication list with you to every doctor’s appointment or emergency room visit. one of the biggest causes of medication errors or side effects is when doctors prescribe people medications that they don’t tolerate or when similar medications are already being prescribed. remember that supplements can have side effects and may interact with your medications – know what you are taking and why you are taking it. when making changes in your medications it’s best to make one change at a time – that way you can identify the likely cause if a side effect occurs. take advantage of the pharmacist’s offer to counsel you regarding new medications.	what steps can i take to reduce my risk of serious drug side effects?

bmi is just a classification of weight and not a determinant of health. that being said carrying extra weight can increase health risk. first i would consider your size over time. have you always been this size or have their been increases lately? if this seems to be your normal weight than it may just be where your body wants to be. if it has increased lately you may want to take note of what has changed to see if it has affected your weight. next would be to look at your other health-related numbers. if you cholesterol blood pressure and blood glucose are all normal than those are positive indicators of health. regular exercise and a health diet matter too! lastly where you carry excess weight makes a difference. those who carry fat in the abdomen tend to be at higher risk for chronic disease like diabetes and heart disease. in particular figuring out your waist-hip ratio can help you determine if this is a concern for you (see this article for more information). weight is just one piece of the health puzzle. finding out about all the other pieces can help a great deal!	bmi of 35. i am 29 a woman who is 4'11 weigh 178 lbs. my breasts are over dd. i am not fat. how can my range be obese? . i have large hips but they are mostly muscle. my breasts are the only other large fat content place on my body. are there better ways of determining a healthy weight?

adjusting your diet is usually the first step in lower cholesterol. the tlc diet or therapeutic lifestyle changes diet is recommended by the national institute of health and it recommends lower the fat in your diet. the following are guidelines to follow to lower cholesterol: avoid saturated fat and oils such as butter bacon drippings lard palm oil and coconut oil. instead use soft tub margarine or vegetable oils such as olive or canola oil. limit trans fatty acids or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. these oils go through a process that makes them solid. they're found in hard margarines snack crackers cookies chips and shortenings. limit fatty meats such as corned beef pastrami ribs steak ground meat hot dogs sausage bacon and processed meats like bologna. also limit egg yolks and organ meats like liver and kidney. replace with skinless chicken or turkey lean beef veal pork lamb and fish. try some meatless main dishes like beans peas pasta or rice. limit meat poultry and fish to no more than two servings or 5 oz (140 g) a day. remember that a serving is about the size of a deck of playing cards. limit milk products that contain more than 1% milk fat. this includes cream most cheeses and nondairy coffee creamers or whipped toppings (which often contain coconut or palm oils). instead try nonfat or low-fat milk (0% to 1% fat) and low-fat cheeses. limit snack crackers muffins quick breads croissants and cakes made with saturated or hydrogenated fat whole eggs or whole milk. try low-fat baked goods and use any spreads or toppings lightly. dip bread in olive oil instead of spreading butter or margarine on your bread. avoid fast foods like hamburgers fries fried chicken and tacos. they are high in both total fat and saturated fat. when you eat out choose broiled sandwiches or chicken without skin salads with low-fat dressing and foods that aren't fried. ask the server to leave off the cheese and high-fat dressings like mayonnaise. this link also includes a sample meal plan.	can i get a list of foods that can help lower my cholesterol levels please?

the small intestine has an inner lining of cells that form finger-like projections called villi. the villi are important because they increase the number of cells and surface area available for the absorption of nutrients from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream. in celiac disease inflammation destroys the villi causing the inner lining of the small intestine to become flattened. this loss of villi reduces the cells and surface area available for absorption of nutrients. the impaired absorption of nutrients is referred to as malabsorption. the malabsorption of nutrients leads to nutrient deficiencies referred to as malnutrition. the length (amount) of the small intestine affected by the loss of villi varies from patient to patient and the length that is involved determines the severity of signs and symptoms. thus patients whose entire small intestine is affected by a loss of villi have more severe signs and symptoms of malabsorption than patients who have only part of the small intestine affected. when only part of the small intestine is affected it usually is the upper small intestine (the duodenum and jejunum) that is more affected than the lower small intestine (the ileum).	what does celiac disease do to the small intestine?
plaques from atherosclerosis can: stay within the artery wall. there the plaque grows then stops. they don't block blood flow so may never cause symptoms. grow in a slow controlled way into the path of blood flow. eventually they cause significant blockages. pain on exertion (in the chest or legs) is the usual symptom. in the worst case they can suddenly rupture allowing blood to clot inside an artery. in the brain this causes a stroke; in the heart a heart attack. the plaques cause three kinds of cardiovascular disease: coronary artery disease: stable plaques in the heart's arteries cause angina (chest pain on exertion). sudden plaque rupture and clotting causes heart muscle to die. this is a heart attack or myocardial infarction. cerebrovascular disease: ruptured plaques in the brain's arteries causes strokes with potential for permanent brain damage. temporary artery blockages can also cause transient ischemic attacks (tias) warning signs of stroke; however there is no brain injury. peripheral artery disease: narrowing in the arteries of the legs caused by plaque. that causes poor circulation pain on walking and poor wound healing. severe disease may lead to amputations.	how does atherosclerosis damage the cardiovascular system?
antithyroid medicine is often used for hyperthyroidism because it works more quickly than radioactive iodine therapy. radioactive iodine therapy destroys part or all of the thyroid gland depending on the dosage used. but antithyroid medicine does not cause permanent thyroid damage. you may take antithyroid medicine before you have radioactive iodine treatment or surgery-to bring your metabolism to normal to make you feel better or to reduce the chances of more serious problems. antithyroid medicine does control hyperthyroidism in many people. but the medicine does have some drawbacks. you have to take the medicine for at least 1 year. your symptoms may come back after you stop taking it. and then you have to start taking antithyroid medicine again or try a different treatment. there are some rare side effects from the medicine ranging from a rash to a low white blood cell count which can make it hard for your body to fight infection. your doctor may prescribe additional medicines to treat symptoms caused by hyperthyroidism such as rapid heartbeat or dry eyes. these medicines can help you feel better while you wait for another treatment to begin to work. medication choices antithyroid medicines additional medicines what to think about antithyroid medicine may or may not make your hyperthyroidism permanently go away. somewhere between 30% and 50% of people will have their hyperthyroidism go away (go into remission ) after taking antithyroid medicine for 1 or 2 years. 3 antithyroid medicine works best if you have mild hyperthyroidism if this is the first time you are being treated for graves' disease if you are younger than 50 or if your thyroid gland is only swollen a little bit (small goiter). it is not used for thyroiditis. antithyroid medicine is used instead of radioactive iodine if you are pregnant breast-feeding or trying to become pregnant. children are treated with antithyroid medicine because experts do not know if radioactive iodine treatment is safe for children. treating children with antithyroid medicine is challenging. it is hard to know how much medicine they need when they are growing so quickly. your doctor may prescribe low doses of thyroid hormone medicine to take with your antithyroid medicine so that your thyroid hormone levels do not get too low. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat hyperthyroidism?

surgery to remove cancer may be used to treat metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. the type of surgery chosen depends upon the stage of the cancer. surgery choices surgical options include: bowel resection. this operation involves cutting into the abdomen to reach the area of the colon or rectum that is affected by the cancer. the surgeon cuts out the cancer as well as the parts of the colon or rectum that are next to it. then the two healthy ends of the colon or rectum are sewn back together. liver resection. in this operation the surgeon cuts out cancer that has spread to the liver as well as parts of the liver that are next to the cancer. up to half of your liver can be removed as long as the rest is healthy. two other methods to destroy cancer cells in the liver include radio waves (radiofrequency ablation) and heat (microwave coagulation). cryosurgery. also called cryotherapy this type of surgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. it is used when the tumors in the liver are still fairly small. if cancer that has returned to your intestine is large more of your colon or rectum may have to be removed. the ends of your colon or rectum are rejoined during surgery. if they can't be rejoined you may need a colostomy. most people do not need a permanent colostomy. for more information see: bowel disease: caring for your ostomy. when cancer has spread to other parts of the body the kind of surgery you will need depends on where the cancer is and how big the tumor is. sometimes surgery is used not to cure your cancer but to make your life more comfortable. if a tumor is blocking your colon for example the surgeon may remove it to allow your intestine to work normally. if advanced cancer is blocking your rectum your doctor may place an expandable tube called a stent in the rectum to unblock it. what to think about surgery may be used to remove metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer that is confined to the colon or that has spread to the liver lungs or bones. surgery does not usually cure metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer but it may relieve pain and discomfort slow the spread of the disease and help you live longer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for colorectal cancer metastatic or recurrent?

i think the best thing to do is get a physical and lab work done. you need to check your hemoglobin a1c to see what your average blood sugar have been. you also could be anemic or dealing with another nutrition deficiency. here are some potential causes of being tired. you also want to check your diet to make sure you are eating right -- consuming regular meals with all the food groups and a carb-rich snack before your practices for energy. see this article for more on what to eat before during and after exercise. with some detective work you will discover why your body is not getting into the shape the way it typically does. listen to it it's trying to tell you something. good luck!	i've been running a ton but i cannot seem to get in shape. what's going on here? . i'm a college basketball player. i have t1 diabetes. i've never had a problem with getting in shape and staying in shape until this season. we run about fifteen suicides a practice and full court scrimmaging. but after two months i still get out of breath very quickly. we had off the other day and since i always feel so out of shape i decided to hit the tredmill to see if i could run a bit. i only was able to run about six minutes before i got tired. how come i'm not getting in shape?
it's urgent to talk to your doctor about all of these things. if you don't have a therapist or psychiatrist talk to your regular primary care doctor about these concerns. they will probably refer you to get a mental health evaluation and see a therapist/psychiatrist. the psychiatrist may or may not put you on meds to help with these issues. you could have depression with generalized anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder.	i have been having anxiety attacks trouble sleeping weepyness severe agitation lack of motivation to do anything. i am wondering which of these is the most urgent to get my dr to help me with. are these signs of depression or something else?
the short answer is: everyone should know his/her hiv status. you may have known your status prior to this episode of unprotected anal sex but now your status may have changed. it would be in your best interest to get tested again. because it takes anywhere from six weeks to several months for the body to begin producing hiv antibodies (which is what the hiv test is designed to detect) you may need to be tested several times over the next 12 months to be sure you didn't pick up the virus from your sex partner. i'd also suggest you have a conversation with your health care provider about whether or not you should take more aggressive measures than repeated screenings. he or she is in the best position to advise you. above all else please practice safe sex by using a condom. unprotected anal sex isn't a wise idea but remember it's also possible to transmit hiv through vaginal sex. anyone who is sexually active should take responsibility for the safety of him/herself and his/her partner. hope this helps!	if i had unprotected anal sex with someone i did not know but they said they were clean should i consider taking hiv pep. it was 2-3 hours ago

mono can cause the liver and/or spleen to enlarge to the point that it is vulnerable to a blunt injury not uncommon in soccer. assuming that she does not have liver or spleen enlargement and her liver enzymes (a blood test) are normal she may be able to play. the doctor really should not have left it up to you. i agree. this is really a medical decision based on physical exam findings. mono can be mild. and mono can be very problematic so unfortunately without knowing the details of her particular case and of course those critical physical examination and lab findings you will need to put the ball back in the doctor's court to make this decision.	daughter tested positive for mono. the only symptom is swollen lymph nodes in her neck. can she play soccer? . she has no fever no swollen spleen no sore throat no fatigue. dr left it up to us whether or not she should play! just want to hear other opinions.

"the prostate is a gland located below the bladder of men. it surrounds the urethra (you-reeth-rah) which is a tube that drains urine from the bladder. bph is an enlargement of the prostate gland. the symptoms of bph however can be caused by an increase in the tightness of muscles in the prostate. if the muscles inside the prostate tighten they can squeeze the urethra and slow the flow of urine. this can lead to symptoms such as: a weak or interrupted stream when urinating. a feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely. a feeling of delay when you start to urinate. a need to urinate often especially at night or a feeling that you must urinate right away. treatment options for bph there are three main treatment options for bph: program of monitoring or ""watchful waiting.

i'm sorry to hear this. it's hard when we feel food choices are being taken away from us! i'm glad to see you can differentiate between an intolerance (having an undesirable reaction) to a true allergy (hives anaphylaxis etc. ). big difference. i wish i could tell you why these food intolerances seem to be coming on all at once. it's certainly worth getting the situation checked out by a doctor. i can tell you that it takes exposure to develop an intolerance or allergy so perhaps your body just reached its exposure threshold with certain items and is now reacting badly to them. here is some general information on food allergies and intolerance that might be helpful. you might start with your primary care provider to see if he or she can provide any insight. i wish you all the best! i am also 54 and female. i cannot tolerate yeast eggs wheat rice and marjoram coming on also in the last year in addition to existing intolerance to dairy and soy. those two came on when i was 40 and 41. i always blamed the giardia infection i had when i was 30. after scopes and xrays my gastroenterologist says that my gi system is healthy! if this helps - you are not alone!	why am i developing multiple food intolerances all of a sudden? . i'm a 54 year old female and over the last 12 months have developed food intolerances to yeast (bakers and brewers) eggs cinnamon and soy in addition to existing allergies to peanuts and shellfish.

preparation for ultrasound is minimal. generally if internal organs such as the gallbladder are to be examined patients are requested to avoid eating and drinking with the exception of water for six to eight hours prior to the examination. this is because food causes gallbladder contraction minimizing the size which would be visible during the ultrasound. in preparation for examination of the baby and womb during pregnancy it is recommended that mothers drink at least four to six glasses of water approximately one to two hours prior to the examination for the purpose of filling the bladder. the extra fluid in the bladder moves air-filled bowel loops away from the womb so that the baby and womb are more visible during the ultrasound test.	how do patients prepare for an ultrasound?

ichthyosis as you rightly mentioned is a genetic condition leading to excessively dry and flaky skin. there is no cure for this condition but it can be controlled by using right medications and thus bringing the normal texture back. for the same follow these suggestions: use a mild soap like cetaphil soap. use lukewarm water to bathe and add liquid paraffin (2 caps full) in the water. after having the bath use a cotton wash cloth to slightly rub off the scales. this will dislodge the scales. always pat your skin to make it dry. use a thick emollient after bathing like cetaphil dam. mix cetaphil dam cream and cotaryl cream in equal amounts and apply all over the body. apply cotaryl cream over the affected area at night. and whenever you feel the need of moisturiser just use plain cetaphil dam. take diet rich in omega fatty acids such as fish nuts flax seeds and etc. once in a week use an oat meal scrub. mix powdered oats cream and milk and apply it over body and scrub it off. follow all these above steps regularly and you will be sure notice a positive change. consult a dermatologist online for further help --> <link>	Hi Doctor, I am suffering a disease called Ichthyosis.

to prevent high blood pressure first consider your diet. a healthy diet can go a long way toward preventing high blood pressure. trying following the dietary approaches to stop hypertension eating plan also known as the dash diet which emphasizes plenty of fruits and vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products. studies conducted by the national institutes of health have shown that the dash diet can dramatically lower blood pressure. and the results show up fast? often within two weeks. at the same time cut down on salt (sodium chloride) which can raise blood pressure. the national high blood pressure education program recommends no more than 2 300 milligrams of sodium a day. the ideal is even lower? only 1 500. for the average man who consumes about 4 200 milligrams a day that requires a big change. but studies show that the lower your salt intake the lower your blood pressure. along with a healthier diet it is smart to be as active as possible to prevent high blood pressure. in 2007 researchers at the university of minnesota published results from a study of almost 4 000 people between the ages of 15 and 30 who were followed over time. the more active they were the lower their risk of developing hypertension. a few other changes can also keep your blood pressure in check. both excessive alcohol consumption and smoking can raise blood pressure. men who drink alcohol should stick to no more than two standard drinks a day. and if you smoke the advice is obvious: get serious about quitting.	how can i prevent high blood pressure?

botox can prevent migraine headaches. this was first noted by a plastic surgeon who was using it to treat wrinkles and found that his patients told him they had fewer headaches. botox is currently being extensively studied as a preventive medication for a variety of headaches including in migraine sufferers with chronic daily headache (meaning having headaches more than 16 days out of the month) with the early data showing that it is effective in reducing the number of headaches in these people. the medicine is injected into specific areas in the front and side of the head. botox has not yet been approved for this use although the studies being carried out are designed to be suitable for fda approval. the mechanism of action by which botox prevents headaches is unknown. it may work by directly affecting the muscles being injected or it may be transported to and act in other sites in the body such as the brain.	how does botox help migraine headaches?

the typical fertile window is 3-5 days long and it is just before you ovulate. ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before the next menstrual period starts. so in a 30 day cycle ovulation should occur around day 16 and your fertile period is between cycle days 11-16. the fertile window is determined when the cervical mucous becomes more elastic and receptive to sperm. some women notice that is is more slippery when they wipe during this time. men need to ejaculate once within a week of the fertile window to increase the number of younger sperm that will be in the ejaculate during the fertile window and have intercourse at least once during the fertile window. the day the opk turns positive is probably the last day of the fertile window so i would try a little earlier. don't worry about the semen leaking out of the vagina. that is normal. only about 10% of the sperm are expected to get into the cervical canal which is a reservoir and will release sperm slowly for days after intercourse to ensure that sperm are present when the egg is released.	if i am trying to get pregnant when should i have sex if the ovulation predictor kit tells me what day i ovulated? . and what can i do keep the sperm inside me longer?

"know your personal risk: if you have a life-threatening condition that requires you to take medication every day your health is at greater risk if because of a disaster you are unable to gain access to needed medications. taking stock of your health issues will dictate what and how much you need to do to prepare yourself for a possible emergency. create a disaster preparedness kit: everyone should have a disaster preparedness kit which contains a host of essentials -- food water first aid supplies medicine and clothing -- so that you can function on your own for at least three days. to see a full list of necessary items for a disaster kit check out the cdc's website so you can make your own. you can also buy pre-packaged kits from various sources online. stock up on medications: include in your disaster kit any medications you or family members take on a regular basis. it's best to consult with your doctor and/or pharmacist about the best way to store them. if you don't have extra medications to store get a written prescription you can hold onto or at least a list of prescriptions with your doctor's signature. it's also a good idea to have a friend or family member living in another place hold onto medications or other needed items. contact list: have an emergency contact list you keep with you and also provide to someone else such as a coworker or someone out of state. phone numbers of local organizations such as the police and fire departments are good to have on-hand. stay social: don't forget about the power of social media sites including facebook and twitter when it comes to accessing important information and letting others know how you're doing. in addition on the american red cross' website family and friends can search for people who have registered themselves "" safe and well.

methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa is an increasingly common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections. mrsa has become a common bacterium causing skin infections in people that seek medical attention. most skin and soft tissue infections begin with redness irritation warmth and swelling of the infected area. because community-acquired mrsa is a virulent (aggressive) bacterium the infection may develop quickly and create a painful red swollen bump on the skin. this may be called a furuncle a boil or an abscess. itching is not one of the main features of mrsa infection. most skin itching is due to dermatitis -- skin that’s inflamed by non-infectious causes. allergies dry skin eczema or chemical irritation are some of the most common causes of skin itching due to dermatitis. dermatitis tends to be mild and come and go while often a true mrsa skin infection tends to get steadily worse without treatment. that’s not to say that an mrsa infection can never itch. for example skin that’s already irritated and itchy (as from a dermatitis) is more vulnerable to infection by mrsa or another bacterium. an mrsa skin infection by itself might be itchy at first but it would be expected to become tender or painful as the infection progressed.	does mrsa itch?
hi how to start a diet it would be a good thing to your dachshunds food intake by one third of its normal daily amount and this does include meals and treats. replace dog biscuits and other treats with carrots apples and oranges these last two you can do as a mix. most dogs enjoy the taste of fruits and vegetables and it is healthier for them. replace a small portion of their meal with green beans or a mix of carrots and peas. if your dachshund eats one cup of food replace one third of the meal with either of the veggies above. this will reduce the calorie amount and provide them with a healthy filler food. dogs do love a good exercise routine with your dachshund. whether it is throwing a ball to play fetch or taking your dog on a walk exercise will always help with weight loss. and dogs do love there walks even if it rains just get out there with them its both of you good twice a day is very good. think of feeding your dachshund a raw meat diet. but try talking this through with your vet first. do hope this helps you. good luck	is feeding a dachshund that is overweight half a hotdog and two teaspoons of wet dog food healthy? . my in-laws think that giving their overweight dachshund too much wet dog food will make her fatter. however they don't think feeding her half a hot dog will do that. are they right or wrong?
my first bit of advice is to you my young man: be sure to use a condom. birth control pills aren't nearly as effective if they're not taken correctly. you both may be at risk right now of her being pregnant so if her period doesn't start on time she probably will want to take a home pregnancy test. meanwhile your girlfriend should start the new pack on the correct date (as if she hadn't gotten off track). she will need to take her pills correctly for at least 30 days in order to be confident she is protected against pregnancy. for more information your girlfriend can consult her pharmacist or the medical professional who prescribed the pills. also my general public service announcement: always remember birth control isn't the responsibility of just one person in a relationship. even if the woman takes birth control pills it's a good idea for the man to use a condom. this helps prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and adds protection against unwanted pregnancy. likewise for girls: even if a guy volunteers to use a condom you need to use some kind of birth control yourself if you want to avoid pregnancy. don't rely on just one method. take care!

i had an extremely high metabolic rate and was an athlete competing in martial arts. i had to gain weight to compete with stronger opponents in a heavier weight class. let's keep it simple 3 key elements will allow you to gain muscle mass/weight. 1. rest - get two days/week of rest to recover from training. you grow when you're resting. you can split up the 2 days or have it simultaneously. take it easy on those days and don't do anything too physical. 2. train - lift heavy weights with low reps for 1 1/2 hour and then do another 30 min of plyometrics. next day do it in reverse. repeat this cycle throughout the week. if you're an athlete you'll need to extend training time up to 3 hrs in one day. when running do sprints. do high impact high intensity exericises. do not perform long-distance endurance training. if you have to run don't go over 3 miles. 3. eat - consume a lot of carbs from veggies and fruits. 3/4 of your meal should be carbs to give you energy and pack on necessary fat. 1/4 of your meal should be protein to build muscle. contrary to popular beliefs you need plenty of fat storage in order for the body to be healthy and build muscle. consuming protein volume based on your body weight is not accurate for everyone some bodies will not utilize extra protein. you want that carb for energy to push harder and grow bigger/stronger. eat pasta rice and potatos with every meal. you will bulk up in size/strength adding 10 lbs of muscle like me within a month. if you get too bulky and need to trim down to make weight for athletic competition then reverse the diet eat more protein and less carbs. always drink a ton of water! find people with similar goals to train with! it's not just about building your body it's also about building a community. good luck!	i have a very high metabolism and i can't gain weight. how can i lower my metabolism while exercising more? . i'm 20 years old 6' tall and weigh only about 150-155. i'm also not very active. i want to start running and lifting weights but it's tough for me to gain muscle because i have a very hard time putting on weight. what can i do to lower my metabolism enough to start putting on weight and getting bigger? i also don't eat very well but tend to eat a descent amount of protein every day.

dizziness can occur anytime during middle to late pregnancy. here's why it happens: the hormone progesterone dilates blood vessels so blood tends to pool in the legs. more blood is also going to your growing uterus. this can cause a drop in blood pressure especially when changing positions -- and that can make you dizzy. if your blood sugar levels get too low you may feel faint. recommendations: move around often when standing for long periods of time. lie on your left side to rest. this helps circulation throughout your body. avoid sudden movements. move slowly when standing from a sitting position. eat regular small meals throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar.	how can i manage dizziness or feeling faint during pregnancy?

the post-operative swelling and numbness after mandible fracture surgery are common. the swelling is mild as you have mentioned. then it should resolve in another one to two weeks as the tissues heal. the numbness is because the mental nerve which runs through the mandible is hurt at some point during surgery. it can last from a few days to even three months. in most of the cases the numbness will fade away automatically when the nerve regeneration takes place. you will feel pricking kind of electric shock at times during the day as a sign of nerve healing. but if the numbness lasts for more than three months then it should be given attention. meanwhile i suggest tablet nurokind 500 (mecobalamin) once daily after meals for 30 days which helps in nerve repair. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take medicine with consent. for further information consult a dentist online --><link>	Hi doctor,I was having a bilateral fracture of mandible at angles on both sides and have done the surgery.

based on the type of hpv you may or may not have visible genital warts. common hpv types 6 and 11 produce visible warts. these warts may go away on their own stay the same or increase in amount. other hpv types such as 16 and 18 do not produce visible genital warts. these types which may be found with a pap test are associated with precancerous cervical cell changes and cervical cancer. hpv infection and cervical cell changes in women most precancerous or cancerous cell changes associated with hpv infection occur on the cervix. this is because the cells of the cervix naturally undergo changes in an area called the transformation zone. this process can cause cervical cells to become abnormal when they are infected with hpv. infection with high-risk types of hpv increase the chance that a woman with hpv will develop abnormal cervical cell changes. it is important to have regular exams with your doctor. if your doctor finds abnormal cells on a pap test the cells can be treated to help prevent them from changing to cancer. hpv infection during pregnancy the presence of hpv and abnormal cell changes does not affect the outcome of the pregnancy. a pregnant woman infected with the type of hpv that causes genital warts may have more complicated warts than a woman who is not pregnant. genital warts may increase in size bleed or become infected with bacteria. your doctor may recommend treatment. warts may be passed on to the newborn but this is rare. hpv infection and cancer in men it is not clear whether men who are infected with hpv on the penis are more likely to have precancerous or cancerous changes on the penis than men who are not infected. because hpv does cause cell changes more research is being done to determine whether hpv increases the risk of penile cancer. in the united states cancer of the penis is extremely rare (fewer than 1 case in 100 000 occurs each year). studies have shown that the risk of penile cancer is extremely low in circumcised men. among men who receive anal sex hpv infection of the anal canal is associated with an increased risk of anal cancer. this risk may be especially high in men who also have hiv infection. 2 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get genital warts human papillomavirus?
people vary in their reactions to mosquito bites. most people develop itchy raised bumps on the skin that last several days. no treatment is necessary but calamine lotion or over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream can reduce itching. a few people have a significant allergy to mosquito bites. the bites can result in what’s called a large local reaction: swelling blistering itching and pain affecting a wide area of the body (such as an entire arm or leg). oral antihistamines like cetirizine (zyrtec) diphenhydramine (benadryl) or hydroxyzine (atarax vistaril) can help ease itching. topical hydrocortisone may also help. rarely people with a severe allergy to mosquito bites develop anaphylaxis a whole-body life-threatening allergic reaction. symptoms of anaphylaxis include: • itching or rash especially hives in areas of skin away from the bite. • hoarseness or shortness of breath. • lightheadedness. anaphylaxis requires emergency medical attention. people who have had anaphylaxis-like symptoms previously should always have injectable epinephrine (an epi-pen) nearby. antiseptic will help get rid of the pain from the bite. antihistamine cream or lotions will help to keep any reactions to that bite away (best to go to doctors or take precautional measures either using epipen e. t. c. if you do have allergic reactions) i would sugest to go to the doctor straight away telling him its urgent if you have any of these symptons: fever rash joint pain or conjunctivitis muscle pains or headaches especially if the bite hole gets enlargens. shaking chills that can range from moderate to severe. high fever. profuse sweating. headache. nausea. vomiting. diarrhea. anemia. thank you for asking.	how do i treat mosquito bites?

you’re right in that the 220 – age formula to calculate maximum heart rate is outdated and doesn’t hold much merit. this particular formula was developed by william haskell in 1970 and he openly acknowledges that he didn’t use a very representative sample and that it was only meant to be used as a rough estimate. there have been many other studies that have attempted to develop a maximum heart rate formula since haskell developed the 220 – age formula in 1970; the only problem is that i don’t believe there is a consensus in regards to which among those is the most appropriate formula to use. there have even been other formulas developed that attempt to distinguish between males and females and others that differentiate between athletes and non-athletes. the 220 – age is the easiest method of calculation for maximum heart rate applicable to the general population though it’s certainly not the most accurate. there are other formulas developed by different researchers but i don’t believe that there’s a clear consensus in regards to which is the most accurate or the best replacement	how was maximum heart rate determined? . your target heart rate calculator page claims to calculate the highest safe heart rate during exercise using the formula 220 minus age for maximum heart rate. i thought haskell and fox made up that formula in 1970 from 11 experimental studies of maximum attainable heart rate and no subjects were harmed in these experiments. if that's so that formula has nothing to do with safety. am i right? if not what studies were used to determine what heart rate is safe?

"as far as when the cancer is gone it may take 18-24 months for the radiation to clear the cancer from your prostate gland. the psa should go down to a very low number. the best results are when the psa goes to less than 0. 2ng/ml. certainly if the psa does not fall to below 0. 5ng/ml by 2 years this may mean the brachytherapy did not work completely. if your psa does not drop to these low levels you may need another prostate biopsy but this should not generally be done until after 18-24 months. there is also something called ""psa bounce"" where the psa can temporarily bump up after brachytherapy. this is important because if this happens in the first 2 years you should not worry about cancer returning right away and wait out the psa bounce and usually it falls back down. in general. brachytherapy is a good choice for men in their 70's. ."	i am 74 years old and underwent brachytherapy for my prostate cancer. how will i know when the prostate cancer is gone?

i certainly understand her reluctance to seek medical attention when she doesn't have insurance. many communities offer free or low-cost clinics to people who are uninsured. maybe you can help her find one of these. i think your daughter needs to get this checked out. it may be completely benign such as a lipoma (a fatty non-cancerous tumor). but then again it could be something more serious. certainly if your daughter has a fever or is experiencing unintended weight loss she needs to be checked out as soon as possible. you might encourage your daughter also by reminding her the cost of an office visit is substantially less than the cost of an emergency room visit so why put off getting this thing looked at? i wish your daughter all the best!	my daughter has a lump on the right side of her neck. it feels hard and is tender. if you make a circle with your thumb and pointing finger it is about that size. it is literally on the side of her neck not where i would think glands are. it is noticable without touching it. without insurance she is reluctant to go to the doctor but i'm concerned.

it looks like you've already done a lot of research on your options. if you do qualify for tax credit subsidies from the federal government you can choose to pay the monthly premium in advance and then claim the credit later on your taxes or to have the credit sent directly to the insurer. if you choose the second approach you would pay the reduced premium amount. for consumers who qualify for additional assistance with reduced copayments and deductibles those extra subsidies are sent directly to the insurer or health plan you choose so you do not have to pay those amounts out of pocket.	i have quotes for myself and my 2 children for a plan through the health insurance marketplace. one example of marketplace costs is blue cross premier gold = monthly premium of $1 112. 09. figuring it with my actual income reduces it with tax credit subsidies to $614. 01 per month. does the government pay that difference to bcbs or does bcbs reduce the premium?

running will burn more calories than the elliptical although it's pretty close (about 100 calories per hour difference). some of the difference is due to the pounding of running and the fact that you propel your body through the air so that both feet are off the ground simultaneously. this kind of movement takes lots of energy. both the elliptical and running burn substantially more calories than the bike at the same level of perceived exertion (about 200-240 calories per hour more). in a classic study comparing energy expenditure of exercise machines the order of calories burned from highest to lowest is posted below. (the elliptical was not studied in this research but it would fit between rowing and cross-country skiing. it should be noted that rowing the elliptical and cross-country skiing are all very close in calorie expenditure with probably not more than 100-125 calories per hour difference among them. ) treadmill walking/running stair stepping rowing cross-country skiing biking (stationary) now this is not to say that exercises that burn the fewest calories are all bad. to the contrary you can get a great workout and burn lots of calories doing any of them. you'd be hard pressed to say that lance armstrong isn't fit. he's one of the fittest human beings alive and he did it by biking. the point is that if you work hard enough on any of the exercise machines and you work up a sweat and you get your heart rate into your training zone then your heart lungs and muscles aren't going to know the difference. bottom line is that you'll get fit and healthy using any of the machines if you use them consistently and with sufficient intensity. one final note: there is error in estimating energy expenditure on most if not all exercise machines. in some cases it can be as high as 25 percent (the machine overestimates how many calories you burn). there are simply too many variables for the machine to give you an accurate number and so you need to keep that in mind during weight-loss efforts if you are calculating how many calories to eat based on your energy expenditure.	does using an elliptical machine at the gym burn more calories than running on the street or bike riding?

hello both of you were very much protective and thus neither pregnancy nor any infection can be an issue here. i presume being a new performer there is some trauma inside following sex and that can be an issue here. just avoid sex now take some sitz bath and drink plenty of water. if despite all of these you do not feel comfortable within few days; meet your gp for an opinion.	my boyfriend decided to come over to visit me for 2 days because we live in two different states. after sexual intercourse with a condom and we used multiple condoms to be safe in one night. we ran through 5 condoms in one night because we were uncertain about the infections and possibilities of pregnancy. we did not finger and only sexual intercourse. this was my second time attemping this and it did hurt quite a lot when inserting his penis. my problem is that after a couple of days we started on saturday and sunday it started to hurt on the following wednesday and thursday. the pain hurts a lot when i go pee and i feel like my vagina is burning making it uncomfortable to sit. i was sitting on the toilet for some time and randomly i had to go poop making everything go away after. now i feel fine with no pain. i also had a weird light headache as well for a bit before i went poop. p. s i know it's bad to check the condoms for holes but he checked for leakage with water.

probably what happened is what’s called a penile fracture. it really isn’t a break like the break of a bone. but there’s two chambers within the penis that hold the blood the corpora cavernosa. and it’s a very thin-walled structure that becomes very distended very tense and that’s where the rigidity of the erection occurs. in certain rare circumstances the torqueing the stretch on that is enough to pop and crack one of those chambers. classically the man will experience severe excruciating pain sudden disappearance of the erection horrible pain with blood the penis will become purple cracking sound and close but almost excruciating pain and that’s a surgical emergency. they have to stop what they’re doing and go immediately to the emergency room. it may require surgical intervention. the risk of that is because of the risk of the scar from the healing of the tear men can end up with curvature and even permanent impotence. the good news is it’s fairly rare almost always occurs in very aggressive wild sex usually women on top what happens is the penis comes out vaginal vault but goes back in and misses hits the pubic bone in the woman and that’s enough for the organ to pop.	i heard a crack while having sex and now i’ve lost my erection.
"pneumonia may be suspected when the doctor examines the patient and hears coarse breathing or crackling sounds when listening to a portion of the chest with a stethoscope. there may be wheezing or the sounds of breathing may be faint in a particular area of the chest. a chest x-ray is usually ordered to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. the lungs have several segments referred to as lobes usually two on the left and three on the right. when the pneumonia affects one of these lobes it is often referred to as lobar pneumonia. some pneumonias have a more patchy distribution that does not involve specific lobes. in the past when both lungs were involved in the infection the term ""double pneumonia"" was used. this term is rarely used today. sputum samples can be collected and examined under the microscope. pneumonia caused by bacteria or fungi can be detected by this examination. a sample of the sputum can be grown in special incubators and the offending organism can be subsequently identified. it is important to understand that the sputum specimen must contain little saliva from the mouth and be delivered to the laboratory fairly quickly. otherwise overgrowth of noninfecting bacteria from the mouth may predominate. as we have used antibiotics in a broader uncontrolled fashion more organisms are becoming resistant to the commonly used antibiotics. these types of cultures can help in directing more appropriate therapy. a blood test that measures white blood cell count (wbc) may be performed. an individual's white blood cell count can often give a hint as to the severity of the pneumonia and whether it is caused by bacteria or a virus. an increased number of neutrophils one type of wbc is seen in most bacterial infections whereas an increase in lymphocytes another type of wbc is seen in viral infections fungal infections and some bacterial infections (like tuberculosis). bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a thin flexible lighted viewing tube is inserted into the nose or mouth after a local anesthetic is administered. using this device the doctor can directly examine the breathing passages (trachea and bronchi). simultaneously samples of sputum or tissue from the infected part of the lung can be obtained. sometimes fluid collects in the pleural space around the lung as a result of the inflammation from pneumonia. this fluid is called a pleural effusion. if a significant amount of fluid develops it can be removed. after numbing the skin with local anesthetic a needle is inserted into the chest cavity and fluid can be withdrawn and examined under the microscope. this procedure is called a thoracentesis. often ultrasound is used to prevent complications from this procedure. in some cases this fluid can become severely inflamed (parapneumonic effusion) or infected (empyema) and may need to be removed by more aggressive surgical procedures. today most often this involves surgery through a tube or thoracoscope. this is referred to as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or vats."	how is pneumonia diagnosed?

the primary symptoms of parkinson's that may be helped by exercise are slowness of movement stiffness and loss of balance and posture and so exercises that improve these should be done. for improvement of balance try standing exercises as part of your pilates workout whether you are working on a mat or the equipment. standing exercises challenge your muscles and your brain to maintain balance. improvements in people with parkinson's are typically slow but they can occur if you work hard and consistently. as for slowness flexibility and strength are part of the solution. many pilates exercises work through a full range of motion and so stiffness and flexibility should improve. make sure your instructor focuses some of the attention on a full range of movements and holding those positions to improve flexibility. as for strength it typically improves quickly for beginners. this is because strength is not only a function of the mass of the muscle but also because of improvements in nervous-system patterning (impulses from the brain through the central nervous system to the muscles). when you pattern the transmission of impulses from the brain to the muscles by repeating exercises over and over the brain gets better at recruiting more muscles and you get stronger. patterning is important for people with parkinson's because patterning may diminish with a loss of dopamine so repetition of the exercises should help. pure strength is also important not only for activities of daily living but also for well-being. it's fair to say that under most conditions feeling strong feels better than feeling weak and since most of the pilates exercises build strength (whether on the mat or the equipment) there is certainly benefit to be gained. one of the limitations observed with parkinson's patients who do pilates is the lack of motor training for the activities you do during your normal day like opening doors getting in and out of cars and walking so make sure your instructor helps you with that. there is important research in animals to show that regular aerobic exercise has a positive effect on parkinsonian symptoms. in one study scientists gave rats a medication that induces parkinson's disease by destroying brain cells that make dopamine. after administration of the medication to all the rats the researchers then had half the rats exercise for seven days while the other half remained sedentary. after the study they found that the exercising rats lost only 6 percent of their dopamine-containing neurons whereas the sedentary rats lost 87 percent. that's a substantial difference with the potential for important clinical improvements in symptoms. based on those study results you might want to add aerobic exercise in addition to strengthening balance and flexibility work. if you have trouble walking because of balance problems then try holding on to the side rails of the treadmill (research proves that activities of daily living motor performance and ambulation improve even if you hold on) and use walking sticks (or poles). but use two and not one. two sticks help maintain better posture and gait than walking with one cane. opt for the high-tech low-weight type of walking sticks that you can purchase in sporting goods or outdoor stores. they are sold in pairs and some are telescopic so that they shorten for ease in carrying them around. to summarize any pilates exercise that builds strength (as many of them do) and balance will be beneficial but you need to incorporate standing exercises as part of your regime.	which pilates exercises are good for someone with parkinson's disease?

medicine for toxoplasmosis is only needed when the infection affects a growing baby ( fetus ) or someone with a very weak immune system. so although a pregnant woman who has a healthy immune system is not personally at risk when infected treatment is needed to protect her fetus. if you are diagnosed with toxoplasmosis during pregnancy you will be treated with antibiotics. 3 antibiotic treatment reduces the chances that your fetus will become infected. if your fetus becomes infected (diagnosed using amniocentesis ) another antibiotic may replace or be added to your treatment. if your newborn has toxoplasmosis he or she will take antibiotics for the first year of life. this is needed to lower the risk of brain damage and blindness from the infection. medication choices antibiotic therapy what to think about antibiotic treatment during pregnancy may not cure a fetal toxoplasmosis infection. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat toxoplasmosis during pregnancy?
"that's a very interesting question. i certainly think this warrants an investigation. my initial reaction is that a pin in the bone shouldn't cause any problems no matter how long it stays in. but my second reaction was that i don't know (and you may not either) exactly what type of ""pin"" was inserted. was it a screw into the bone? a rod running the length of the bone? we know for example that screws used to repair hip fractures can cause pain years later either from irritation to the surrounding tissues or due to arthritis. it's not impossible the same could be true with your arm. so i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider. he or she can do an initial evaluation and if necessary refer you to a specialist. hope you feel better soon!"	had a pin inserted into by broken arm in 1974. could it cause pain and weakness after all those years?
"hi my friend studies have shown a very strong correlation between a lack of physical activity and the development of anxiety disorders. this relationship isn't entirely clear but many of the proposed causes of this include: unused energy – one of the most frequently cited reasons for anxiety is unused energy. your body was made to move and unfortunately when it doesn't move it creates tension. we see this actually with dogs often – dogs that don't get their daily walks often become anxious and high strung because if they don't work out their energy that energy turns first into physical tension and then into mental tension. increased stress hormone – when you feel stress your body releases a hormone known as cortisol. there's evidence that movement is what depletes cortisol bringing it back to normal levels. this makes sense because anxiety itself is the ""fight or flight"" system. when your body experiences it it expects you to fight or flight. inactivity is essentially doing nothing and that may cause your body to start misfiring your stress and anxiety hormones. immune system malfunction – exercise is also necessary for a regulated immune system as well as maintaining a healthy hormone balance. there's reason to believe that inactivity prevents these important things from occurring. there may also be secondary components as well. those that are often inactive are also often enjoying less experiences and positive experiences are good for anxiety. those that aren't working to improve their health may develop small problems that create anxiety on their own. these may all be contributing factors. so please go ahead with your plan for exercising! good luck on everything! dhammika abeygoonawardhane sri lanka"	i am full time college student want to lose some weight been having anxiety attacks. is it still okay to exercise? . when i told my parents about it my mom asked me if i am getting enough air through my ribs. i did not know. . . the best discriptions to descripe what i was feeling is that it felt like my ribs are crushing in me. . . i am way over weight and want to have a better lifestyle and start exercising. . i am wondering if it would be okay to exercise consider my past with anxiety attacks. . . my record of anxiety attacks counts as 4 or 5 from august to december

"the short answer is: no. but this deserves a bit more discussion. heartburn is a pain that you feel around mid-chest and is caused by acid moving back up into the esophagus from the stomach. this pain often will go away when you take an antacid product such as a chewable tablet like tums or rolaids or a liquid product like maalox. despite its name heartburn does not involve the heart. ischemia is a condition in which body tissue doesn't get enough oxygen usually due to decreased blood flow. the term ischemia is often applied to the heart muscle but ischemia can happen to any muscle or even the brain. when the heart suffers from ischemia it can trigger a pain response which is called ""angina. "" this pain also occurs mid-chest like heartburn so it can sometimes be tricky figuring out if chest pain is a result of stomach acid (heartburn) or ischemia. the two conditions (heartburn and ischemia) have different underlying sources and are not related except in terms of causing pain in the chest. i hope this helps!"	is heartburn associated with ischemia?

personally i found the answer to this above very misleading. although she mentioned the controversy but she did not tell you about the overwhelming evidence against the cdc's view point on chronic lyme disease. you are not alone your are not the only one receiving answers such as this one as to why you are still sick. you will see for yourself through the help of a lyme literate doctor that antibiotics can and will help improve your symptoms. you will also begin to find that no doctor with a closed mind will be able to help you through this. there is a group on facebook called lyme disease awareness go there and get the right information from 13k people just like yourself who have been denied long term treatment from doctors. i was one of those people. i had other doctors who said i was fine call these lyme literate doctors quacks. that quack gave me my life back! go to the columbia university tick borne diseases research center website at the top there is a second opinion option in one of the menus click it and go see doctor brian fallon and get your answers there or at lymedisease. org	could i still have lyme disease? . i was diagnosed 4 yrs ago. i never found a tick bite so i'm not sure how long i had it before i started antibiotics. i've never felt the same. i'm still just as tired and constantly achy in my neck and back. i get terrible headaches that last days. i get sharp pains in my arms all the time. i randomly get dizzy and i've fainted a several times. a year ago someone said it's allergies so i tried allergy medicines and just got sicker. in sept. i had mono. i'm 18 and i still feel like i'm dying!

i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. how frustrating! being able to enjoy a normal sex life is a very important part of our overall health. so your situation definitely merits further investigation. you didn't say whether you injured your upper or lower back but since your sexual problems seem to correlate with the back injury i'd suggest you ask your doctor to investigate whether you may have damaged any nerves in the lower back that relate to sexual arousal. this could be a possible cause for your symptoms. i do believe it's true that orgasms for both sexes become less strong as we get older and may take longer to achieve. but since you're getting right to the brink but can't get over the edge i don't think aging is the issue here. i think you should see your doctor again. wishing you all the best!	why am i unable to have an orgasam after enjoying complete orgasams previously? . up until i injured my back 3 yrs ago i had no problems enjoying sex. i still enjoy it and my husband and i still use different stimulations for pleasure. i get right to the edge and just can't go farther no matter what we do. this is very frustrating for my husband as well. i'm 60 and my doctor says i don't need hrt.

cancer-related fatigue is often made worse if you are not eating or drinking enough or if you are not eating the right foods. maintaining good nutrition can help you feel better and have more energy. the following are strategies to help improve nutritional intake: get plenty of protein. protein rebuilds and repairs damaged (and normally aging) body tissue. the best sources of protein include foods from the dairy group (8 oz. milk = 8 grams protein) and meats (meat fish or poultry = 7 grams of protein per ounce). drink plenty of fluids. a minimum of 8 cups of fluid per day will prevent dehydration. (that's 64 oz. 2 quarts or 1 half-gallon). fluids can include juice milk broth milkshakes gelatin and other beverages. of course water is fine too. beverages containing caffeine do not count. keep in mind that you'll need more fluids if you have treatment side effects such as vomiting or diarrhea. make sure you are getting enough vitamins. speak with your doctor about taking a vitamin supplement if you are not sure you are getting enough nutrients. a recommended supplement would be a multivitamin that provides at least 100% of the recommended daily allowances (rda) for most nutrients. note: vitamin supplements do not provide calories which are essential for energy production. so vitamins cannot substitute for adequate food intake. make an appointment with a dietitian. a registered dietitian provides suggestions to work around any eating problems that may be interfering with proper nutrition (such as early feeling of fullness swallowing difficulty or taste changes). a dietitian can also suggest ways to maximize calories and include proteins in smaller amounts of food (such as powdered milk instant breakfast drinks and other commercial supplements or food additives).	how does nutrition impact energy level when you have cancer?

i can understand your concern regarding your symptoms and side effects of the medications. the symptoms you mentioned above are showing that you are suffering from dysthymia and moderate depression. depression itself is a cause of poor sexual drive. lexapro that is escitalopram may cause loss of libido and sexual dysfunction as you have already stopped this medicine long ago depression is the primary cause of your symptoms. i will suggest you try taking newer invented molecules like vilazodone. this drug has no daytime somnolence and sexual dysfunction. it will help you in early recovery. take it for at least three months and then stop slowly by tapering. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking medicine after their consent. within a couple of weeks you will feel better and these drugs have fewer chances of withdrawal depression when they are stopped and tapered slowly. behavioral therapies like cbt (cognitive behavioral therapy) or dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) and counseling will help you to cope up your stress and will help you to maintain a happy state of mind. visit a nearby psychiatrist for a proper prescription and counseling. your symptoms are curable 20 % of the population spend some part of their life in depression and half of them overcome with this illness. hope my answer helped you. for further queries consult a psychiatrist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am a 23 year old male, and I took Lexapro for two months when I was 20 years old. And then quit abruptly, because every time I would sleep for a very long time without dreaming, and also wake up feeling bad. It has been three years now, and my sexual functioning and libido have gone down, it is called post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD). I was the horniest, sexually explorative, and a creative guy. It is like I am an entirely different person now. My ambitions, sexuality, zest, desires, and emotions, everything has gone. The lack of all this does not even trouble me, which is the strangest thing. I am intellectually troubled by this but cannot feel it, and I feel like a potato. I had tried one dose of Selegiline before, which kind of felt good, but I dropped it due to long-term safety concerns and the possibility of interactions with high tyramine foods. After researching on the internet, and keeping in mind dependancy risks, and effects on receptors, I was thinking of trying Rasagiline. I would be very grateful if you could guide me and suggest some possible cure.
i am not a big fan of self-diagnosis and self-treatment when it comes to a possible rotator cuff tear. i have had two of them; including two surgeries followed by lots of physical therapy. while you will be able to find exercises on the internet my advice to you is to see an orthopedist -- one that specializes in shoulders -- have an mri and see what the heck is going on before you start any type of self-prescribed physical therapy that could make things worse.	physical therapy exercises for a rotator cuff injury. i have diagnosed myself with a rotator cuff injury. i have been resting it (for about 3-4 months now) hoping it would start feeling better but it hasn't. it doesn't bother me in most day-to-day activities (mostly when showering when i reach for my other arm to wash it and i can't sleep very well on my right side). i'm wondering if someone could recommend some exercises i could do to strengthen my shoulder. thanks!

i guess it is possible but you are correct. oral contraception prevents ovulation by hormonal manipulation so the chance of getting an cyst related to ovulation (corpus luteum) cyst would be unlikely. with that said there are other kinds of cysts and other medical reasons to account for your symptoms so an ultrasound would be helpful to make that determination.	can you get ovarian cysts on birth control? . i've been having pains in my lower left abdomen for at least a month now and my doctor told me it could be ovarian cysts. i'm on birth control though and i thought birth control was supposed to prevent them; i've been on ortho tri cyclen for at least six months now. does anyone know if it's possible to still get these cysts while on birth control? . i am scheduling an ultra sound soon i just wanted to see if anyone had input for this.

based solely on your description and the information in your posting i would guess that this was just an undigested seed. many seeds will pass through the gi tract and emerge like this. i don't think this was a parasite or have anything to do with that caterpillar on the celery. i suspect this may be the list time you see these things unless of course you eat sesame seeds again.

no one knows why people get gerd. a hiatal hernia may contribute. a hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach is above the diaphragm the muscle wall that separates the stomach from the chest. the diaphragm helps the les keep acid from coming up into the esophagus. when a hiatal hernia is present it is easier for the acid to come up. in this way a hiatal hernia can cause reflux. a hiatal hernia can happen in people of any age; many otherwise healthy people over 50 have a small one. other factors that may contribute to gerd include alcohol use overweight pregnancy smoking also certain foods can be associated with reflux events including citrus fruits chocolate drinks with caffeine fatty and fried foods garlic and onions mint flavorings spicy foods tomato-based foods like spaghetti sauce chili and pizza	what causes gerd?

"the term ""abnormal"" is quite vague. it simply means ""not normal"". when it comes to a biopsy the most important question would be if this lesion was cancerous or not. some lesions are read as abnormal when they are precancerous lesions. you will need to get a more thorough explanation from your medical provider ask for your exact pathological diagnosis and then inquire about the next step. this could involve excising the lesion wider and more completely various treatments or just watchful waiting. all you really know now is that your biopsy was ""abnormal"". you need much more information from your medical provider."	what could it mean if a biopsy from a lesion that has been removed from the arm comes back abnormal?

first of all this is not acceptable if you take i-pill frequently. as these pills are of high hormonal content it can mess up your internal hormonal balance. so you may have these types of few abnormal bleeding for the following few weeks. now the intermenstrual bleeding or spotting might be due to ovulation itself and does not warrant any treatment. i suggest you to start regular contraceptive pills from the first day of your next cycle onwards. it will help you not only for protection but also for regularization of cycle. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I have been sexually active for the past four months.

doctors define constipation as having a bowel movement less than three times per week. that doesn’t mean constipation is necessarily dangerous just that it’s then labeled abnormal possibly needing treatment. for people who are generally healthy constipation is almost never a serious health risk. so it’s difficult to answer the question of “how long can you go ” because if you’re generally healthy you eventually will go with few if any adverse effects. people for whom constipation can have serious health effects include: • the elderly especially those with dementia; • people with damage to the nerves controlling defecation such as hirschsprung disease or spinal cord injuries. a general rule is if you’re healthy and you’re not experiencing abdominal pain a small delay between bowel movements should be of no concern. from a medical standpoint stimulating bowel movements for their own sake (such as with “colon cleansing” or excessive laxative use) can have risks. constipation can result from hard stools and/or slow movement of the colon. for most healthy people with constipation simple treatments work: • increased fiber intake • bulk-forming laxatives (citrucel fiberall metamucil serutan) • stimulant laxatives (alophen dulcolax ex-lax and senokot) • stool softeners (colace correctol soft gels diocto surfak) a few people will need prescription medicines to help get their bowels moving. if constipation isn’t causing symptoms though waiting for nature to take its course is the best option. 4 to 5 days	how long can you go without a bowel movement? . doctors define constipation as having a bowel movement less than three times per week. that doesn’t mean constipation is necessarily dangerous just that it’s then labeled abnormal possibly needing treatment.
in the beauty section of the los angeles times a recent article discussed how lines develop from not only sun exposure and aging but from animation. it talked about the treatments to deal with these lines. botox and dysport paralyze certain facial muscles and prevent the contraction that causes creases. we have a variety of fillers to plump the hollowness and grooves. there have been some recent additions including juvederm xc and hydrelle which contain local anesthetic to help reduce the pain during injection. however i will tell you that it takes a bit long for the painkiller to take effect and by that time the piercing of the skin is done. recently there has been some interest in stem cells that would augment fat transfer into the face. the article mentioned that “fatty tissue has the highest percentage of adult stem cells of any tissue in the body ” and that “adipose (fat) stem cells have the capacity of cell memory especially in the use of re-volumizing the face. ” my impression is that fat transfer is still not the preferred method because of the inconsistent results. sometimes the fat can shrink. sometimes it can get lumpy and that’s not what patients want. i prefer the man-made injectables because they have a very low incidence of lumps bumps and reaction. if they were to cause any trouble the filler will dissolve and disappear within several months. one of the doctors quoted in the article said “the difference between looking naturally beautiful and looking like a chipmunk is all in the technique. ” i wholeheartedly agree. the art form is as important as the product. technology alone is not enough to overcome lack of talent and judgment.	what's better for wrinkles man-made fillers or fat transfer?

low blood pressure can result in reduced blood flow and circulation into the brain with poor brain function. the usual symptom of dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension) is a depressed level of consciousness—someone acting sleepy or “out of it. ” hallucinations are not a “typical” symptom of low blood pressure. however i wouldn’t rule it out as a possibility in rare cases. it would be important to look for something else causing both the low blood pressure and the hallucinations like a toxic drug effect or dehydration causing delirium in an older person.	can low blood pressure cause hallucinations?
i do not know know why uti are so common in pd but do not believe it is from the pd or the medications. i believe it is from a tendency to dehydration. with declining mobility fluid tends to pool in the legs during the day and at night when the fluid shifts higher in the body to the body it is more easily filtered by the kidneys. so -- you quit drinking enough fluid to keep from being up all the time. this leads decreased frequency of urination. urination will clear small amounts of bacteria and without that infection is more likely. hallucinations occur from a number of causes - uti being one of them. also medications can cause this problem. i try to reduce medications in the order of most likely to least likely. my criteria are potential for side effects vs. potential for motor benefit -- and it is not an exact science: 1) artane or cogentin. 2) amantadine. 3) selegiline. 4) rasagiline. 5) pramipexole or ropinirole. 6) entacapone. 7) levodopa. i would not want to stop levodopa and would likely start a medicine for hallucinations before that. the two most commonly suggested in the us are quetiapine or clozapine.	why are septicemia and urinary tract infections so prevalent with parkinson's? and do the meds cause hallucinations?
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. diet is the first thing to look at whenever the bowels seem out of sync. are you eating enough dietary fiber in the form of vegetables fruits and whole grains? are you drinking enough water to stay hydrated? are you exercising? all of these things can influence the way your bowels perform. examine your diet carefully and honestly. make sure you're consuming several portions of fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits each day. eat whole grain products. if you're eating a lot of pre-packaged or junk foods replace them with fresh alternatives. if you're not exercising several times a week this would be a good time to get started. moderate exercise such as walking three times a week could help you with your blood pressure diabetes and other problems. be sure to get your health care provider's approval before you start a modest exercise regimen. walking will help your bowels too. wishing you well!	i've had constpation loose and diarrhea for5-6 wks. endoscopy & colonoscopy norm. plz help! . i am 52yrs old for 5-6 wks i've had constipation loose then diarrhea everyday. i recently had an endoscopy & colonoscopy and they were both norm. for the first3 wks i had severe nausea and pain in my lower chest area both of them are gone. my meds are amitriptyline 10mg h. s. /atenolol 50mg/atorvistatin 40mg/bupropion 150mg bid/vitamin d 50 000/ metformin 1 000 mg bid/pantoprazole 40mg/ ranitidine 150mg bid/ terbinifine 250mg/carbidopa-levodopa 25-100. please help!

hi some bits of info that may help you. autoimmune disease: autoimmune endocrine disease such as hypothyroidism addison's disease and diabetes may be associated with premature ovarian failure. an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones. common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness weight gain and feeling depressed. an underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. there's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it. this is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood. high cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries restricting the flow of blood. if your offered statins for high cholesterol just say no thank you they have many bad side effects have a read on this one site www. spacedoc. com its packed with info by a whole load of doctors. hope this helps you. good luck	can hypothyroidism cause premature menopause? . i have hypothyroidism and i am almost 40. my doctor thinks i might be going through the early stages of premature menopause. i have read that hypothyroidism can cause it. is this true?

acne develops most often in the teen and young adult years. during this time both males and females usually produce more testosterone than at any other time in life. this hormone causes oil glands to produce more oil (sebum). the extra oil can clog pores and cause acne. bacteria can grow in this mixture. and if the mixture leaks into nearby tissues it causes swelling redness and pus (pimples). acne usually gets better in the adult years when your body produces less testosterone. still some women have premenstrual acne flare-ups well into adulthood. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get acne vulgaris?

when people with high blood pressure lose weight they typically see a decrease in blood pressure. so no it is not normal for weight loss prgrams to cause increases in blood pressure. i am not familiar with these products but i recommend asking the people who work for the program what research they have behind their products/ingredients. remember that dietary supplements are not regulated by the fda so effectiveness and safety are the company's responsibility. for more informationn finding the right weight loss program for you see this article. as people gain weight their blood pressure tends to go up. fortunately as they lose weight their blood pressure tends to go down. but if you weigh normal then weight loss does'nt help. and if reducing weight resulting increse blood pressure then something is wrong! consult your doctor fast!	can any weight loss program increase blood pressure. i went through edmark which gave me a weight loss program. called power 4 slimming & health program. 1 detox-shake off phyto fiber. 2 mrt complex fat burning. 3 balancing splina liquid chlorophyll. 4 rejuvenation edmark cafe & red yeast cofee for. thanks. shariff

it's hard to tell what might be going on without more information. for example if you use any type of hormonal birth control (pill intrauterine device) this can influence your cycle. also if your periods occasionally have been irregular in the past this could just be part of the pattern for you. even if your periods have been very regular it's still not unusual for any healthy woman to experience some variance in her cycle. are you by any chance athletic? are you very lean (have low body fat)? do you have an eating disorder that causes you to be very thin? any of these things can cause you to stop having periods. if you're not having any other symptoms such as fever pelvic pain or anything like that then my suggestion would be to wait it out. if your period doesn't come after a couple of weeks you can make an appointment with a gynecologist for a check-up just to make sure nothing abnormal is going on. hope this helps!	im a 18 year old female and i never haf sex yet and my period is a week late. what can be the problem? . i never had sex

"well it's a good question. motivation is the challenge of every person who wants to achieve a goal be it weight loss becoming an oil painter or anything else. it sounds like you may have invested too much time and effort into research. everything feels overwhelming to you right now doesn't it? don't let that stop you. at a certain point you have to take the plunge and do it. stop thinking about it and just do it. i read an interesting article in which a fitness coach said there is no such thing as ""motivation;"" there are only choices. you can choose to eat an apple or you can choose to eat a candy bar. you can choose to take a walk for 10 minutes or you can choose to watch tv instead. do you see the difference here? i strongly suggest you and your friend check out webmd's diet community where you can share your fears struggles goals and successes with others who will cheer you on! you are not the first person to fear getting started on the path to a healthy life and you won't be the last. meanwhile choose goals you know you can easily accomplish. for example: today i will eat one apple instead of a candy bar today i will throw away all the junk food in my house today i will walk for 10 minutes this week i will walk for 10 minutes every day i mean come on! anyone can do 10 minutes of exercise right? of course you can! lastly don't forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals no matter how small they may be. don't use food as a reward. even if you accomplish just one thing today download a new song to your smartphone take a bubble bath or do something else to celebrate the fact that today at least you won. you don't need ""motivation. "" you just need to take the plunge. i say go for it! wishing you well! there are no magic solutions to motivation but i am pleased that you are doing this with a friend. how about a bet? put some money on the line ($100? ) or house-cleaning (if someone fails to meet their goal they have to clean the other person's house). keep in fun and make sure your goals are reasonable and achievable. start with control. cut out the things you know you are not supposed to eat and stop buying them. write down everything you eat for about a week or so (be honest! ) and try to determine the number of calories you are ingesting. make sure you are under 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight (your goal). any one can lose weight. there is only mismatched strategies. something tells me that you are on your way to success. i suggest that you discuss your diet objectives with a physician and also your significant other. your doctor has had positive experience in knowing what diets work and which diets usually do not work. they also will know what is the best diet for you as an individual. your medical professional is in partnership with you to ensure dietary efficacy and safety. your significant other in life is also probably your best friend will be a cheerleader in your corner and most likely will offer you the motivating support system that is routinely missing with most diets. the diet that boasts the greatest statistical success is probably ""weight watchers"". counting points is relatively easy the food is easy to obtain and online supports are built into the dietary system. do not skip meals drink plenty of water and negotiate rewards for yourself (such as new clothing) upon reaching pivotal goals. if you have a dietary setback don't let it be your reason to throw in the towel. as the old chinese proverb suggests.

"congratulations to your husband on successfully completing treatment for his non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl)! that is terrific. there are many types of nhl and a couple of different types of remission status. let me see if i can help clarify these things. nhl often is grouped into ""aggressive"" and ""indolent"" (non-aggressive) categories. both types of nhl can be treated but the treatment is tailored to the severity of symptoms. both of these types of nhl can go into remission. remission means the lymphoma has been eliminated entirely or reduced substantially. the former is called ""complete remission"" and the latter is called ""partial remission. "" the chance of nhl coming back depends on whether the disease was aggressive or indolent and whether it's now in complete or partial remission. the disease may never return or it may come back at any time in the future. that's the frustrating thing about cancers: we can't predict when or if they'll show up again even after they've been treated. indolent nhl that's in complete remission has a lower risk of coming back in the future. aggressive nhl that's in partial remission carries a higher risk of coming back. this chart goes over some risk factors that influence whether or not nhl in remission may recur (come back). the best thing to do is talk to your husband's doctor about his prognosis and what to do to try to keep the nhl from returning. meanwhile celebrate the fact your husband successfully beat his cancer at least for the moment!"	if my husbands non-hodgkins lymphoma is in remission how long before it comes back and how long will he live?

i'm going to assume you received a valid prescription for tamiflu (oseltamivir) for your child(ren) because pediatric dosing is based on weight. never give a child the same dose of oseltamivir as an adult. the reason i am trying to make sure you have a pediatric prescription for the oseltamivir you're giving your children is because the medication is available as an oral suspension which is what is usually prescribed for children. keep that in mind if you need oseltamivir for your children in the future. at any rate you may pull apart the oseltamivir capsule and pour the contents into a very small amount of sweetened liquid (brown sugar mixed with water is fine) and then have your child drink the whole dose at once. i would not recommend mixing it with orange juice applesauce or any type of soda. fruits contain enzymes and acids that could reduce the effectiveness of the medication. soda contains carbon dioxide that also could act on the medication. try using a medicine cup like the one that usually comes with children's cough and cold remedies to mix up the oseltamivir with sugar water. just make sure the cup is clean. wishing you well!	can children take tamiflu mixed with orange juice or is there something else that mixes better?
a paresthesia is an abnormal sensation of tingling numbness or burning. paresthesias are usually felt in the hands feet arms or legs but can be felt anywhere. the sensation is usually unpleasant. most people have experienced paresthesia in the form of the pins-and-needles sensation that occurs when an arm or leg briefly “falls asleep. ” the sensation is caused by sustained pressure placed on a nerve. this kind of paresthesia is temporary and reversible. paresthesias can also occur regularly when nerves experience ongoing or lasting damage. some of the causes of chronic or persistent paresthesias include: carpal tunnel syndrome meralgia paresthetica (numbness over the outer thigh) compression of a nerve in the spine (radiculopathy) restless legs syndrome shingles (herpes zoster) stroke or transient ischemic attack multiple sclerosis transverse myelitis the treatment for paresthesias depends on the cause. if a reversible cause is present treating it should help improve the paresthesia symptoms. for paresthesias that can’t be cured medicines that act on nerves may be helpful for some people.	what is paresthesia?
since toxoplasmosis usually causes mild to no symptoms and a healthy immune system prevents any remaining parasites in the body from causing further symptoms most people don't need to worry about getting this disease. however if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant there are several steps you should take to prevent exposure to toxoplasmosis. if you have a weakened immune system get a blood test for toxoplasmosis. if your test is positive your doctor can tell you if and when you need to take medicine to prevent the infection from reactivating. if you are planning on becoming pregnant you may consider being tested for toxo. if the test is positive there is no need to worry about passing the infection to your baby (since you should have immunity against the parasite). if you are already pregnant you should discuss your risk of toxoplasmosis with your doctor who may order a blood sample for testing. wear gloves when you garden or do anything outdoors that involves handling soil since cats often use gardens and sandboxes as litter boxes. wash your hands well with soap and warm water after outdoor activities especially before you eat or prepare food. have someone else handle raw meat for you. if this is not possible wear clean latex gloves and thoroughly wash with soap and hot water any cutting boards sinks knives and other utensils that might have touched the raw meat. wash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward. cook all meat thoroughly especially pork or veal.	how can toxoplasmosis be prevented?

prenatal vitamins are very similar to multivitamins. the three elements that are most important for a prenatal vitamin are the amounts of folic acid iron and calcium. typically a prescription prenatal vitamin has more folic acid and/or iron than a nonprescription prenatal vitamin or a traditional multivitamin. it would not be dangerous for your daughter’s husband to take her prenatal vitamins by accident. depending on the product he may have consumed more of some daily vitamins and minerals than is necessary but as a one-time error this should not be harmful.	my daughter’s husband took prescription prenatal vitamins on accident. is this dangerous?

"most helpful answer in my opinion chiropractic adjustments will have little or no curative effect on either of these conditions. a child or teenager with scoliosis should be carefully evaluated and monitored by a specialist. a person with osteoporosis should be under the care of her primary care medical provider or orthopedist. this is kind of a ""loaded"" question. it is like saying can chiropractic care stop the sun from setting or prevent rain. osteoporosis is a bone disease with a decrease in bone density associated with aging (sun setting) or prolonged use of certain medications. scoliosis is either caused by structural abnormality of a vertebrae or idiopathic (unknown). on the flip side of that chiropractic care can certainly help relieve symptoms associated with scoliosis and in some case help manage the process. as children grow the scoliosis curvature needs to be monitored as well as any symptoms they are having. in an ideal world md's and dc's- pt's would work together to manage this process. if you want to live in an ideal world find ""specialists"" who are open minded and educated about not only what they can do but what others can do to help you as well. in the long run you are the one that has to live with whatever condition you have and no one else's ideology should be more important than that."	can chiropractic care reverse osteoporosis or scoliosis?

that's a good (and very reasonable) question. i suggest you call your surgeon's office and ask the nurse or pa. generally whenever someone has scalp incisions we recommend they wait until the incisions are fully healed staples/sutures removed and so on before they apply any hair color. you want to make sure you don't have any openings in the skin when you apply the colorant because this could be irritating or lead to infection. so again best bet is to call your surgeon's office and ask. they can give you specific information. glad to hear you survived the brain aneurysm!	how soon can i safely color my hair after surgery for a brain aneurysm?

in the past home remedies might be sufficient for soothing pink eye symptoms associated with uncomplicated colds minor infections or allergies. treatment consists primarily of cleansing the eyes. to relieve the discomfort of pink eye apply a cold compress for five to 10 minutes three to four times a day. preservative-free artificial tears can be applied a few times a day. never use steroid eye drops or medications from a friend without a doctor's prescription. for pink eye that seems to be from an allergy place a cool compress on your closed eye and use nonprescription allergy eye drops to relieve itching and burning. if the condition does not improve in a few days consult your doctor. if pink eye symptoms do not appear to be associated with a cold or allergy you may want to see your primary care provider or local eye doctor for a more comprehensive evaluation.	what are treatments for non-viral pink eye?

normal urine can range in color from pale yellow (almost colorless) to deep amber. dark amber urine is usually very concentrated and means that you should be drinking more water. foods medications and even vitamins can change the color of urine temporarily but eliminating the cause brings the color back to normal. most changes in urine color are harmless and the color will go back to normal within a day or two. some colors require more attention: a reddish tinge can mean that blood is present in the urine—or it can mean that you just ate beets or blackberries (urine color tends to turn purplish red afterwards. ) if the reddish tinge continues over several days after you've eliminated foods that may be causing the color you should mention it to your primary care provider. greenish urine can mean that you have a urinary tract infection but if it's bright green it can mean that you have too much of b vitamins. certain drugs and some health conditions can cause urine to turn green too so mention this to your health care professional. urine with a bluish tint can mean some type of bacterial infection or may just mean that you have a high level of calcium. if this persists give your health care professional a call. brown urine can indicate a potentially serious condition and you should contact your doctor's office for help. sometimes laxatives can temporarily turn urine brown but if this dark color stays get it checked out.	what do the different urine colors mean?
the answer is: not necessarily. the birth control pill isn't considered completely effective until it's been taken for a full month. your health care provider should have explained this to you before you received your first package of pills. since you had unprotected sex before the first month was up you should call your health care provider to find out if you should continue taking the pills as directed. taking birth control pills while pregnant is not a good idea. your health care provider can advise you as to your best course of action. you also need to be aware that birth control pills only work to prevent pregnancy. they do not protect you against sexually transmitted diseases so you still need to practice safe sex with a condom. hope this helps!	i just started birth control for the first time. i took seven pills and on the 8th day i had sex. was i protected?

"the rule of thumb is that [you are no longer contagious] when you do not have a fever for more than 24 hours and did not take any medications to help reduce the fever. when you don't have a fever your not contagious according to the u. s. cdc: ""most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. symptoms start 1 to 4 days after the virus enters the body. that means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick as well as while you are sick. some persons can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. during this time those persons may still spread the virus to others. "" according to the center for disease control you are contagious for 1-4 days before you ever become sick with the flu so if you are not running fever but are still contagious before the fever comes then how can you still not be contagious for at least 5 days after you stop having fever? evidently the flu doesnt need fever to be contagious in the beginning. after fever subsides"	when is the flu no longer contagious?

usually not but some types can be. most pneumonias come from bacteria we carry in our noses and throats. the bacteria can occasionally gain entry into the deepest parts of our lungs where they multiply and cause a pneumonia. some bacterial pneumonias occur when oral or nasal secretions are aspirated during sleep. because we “catch” these bacteria from ourselves these pneumonias are not contagious in the way a cold virus is. however these bacteria sometimes do get passed from person to person in the population. mycoplasma pneumonia is a common cause of “walking pneumonia” in young adults and is highly contagious. tuberculosis (tb) is a special type of bacterial pneumonia that is contagious. tb is very uncommon in the u. s. although people that work in health care are at higher risk. mycoplasma pneumonia and tb are typically spread by breathing in droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person.	is bacterial pneumonia contagious?

"uncomplicated high blood pressure usually occurs without any symptoms (silently) and so hypertension has been labeled ""the silent killer. "" it is called this because the disease can progress to finally develop any one or more of the several potentially fatal complications of hypertension such as heart attacks or strokes. uncomplicated hypertension may be present and remain unnoticed for many years or even decades. this happens when there are no symptoms and those affected fail to undergo periodic blood pressure screening. some people with uncomplicated hypertension however may experience symptoms such as headache dizziness shortness of breath and blurred vision. the presence of symptoms can be a good thing in that they can prompt people to consult a doctor for treatment and make them more compliant in taking their medications. often however a person's first contact with a physician may be after significant damage to the end-organs has occurred. in many cases a person visits or is brought to the doctor or an emergency room with a heart attack stroke kidney failure or impaired vision (due to damage to the back part of the retina). greater public awareness and frequent blood pressure screening may help to identify patients with undiagnosed high blood pressure before significant complications have developed. about one out of every 100 (1%) people with hypertension is diagnosed with severe high blood pressure (accelerated or malignant hypertension) at their first visit to the doctor. in these patients the diastolic blood pressure (the minimum pressure) exceeds 140 mm hg! affected persons often experience severe headache nausea visual symptoms dizziness and sometimes kidney failure. malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and requires urgent treatment to prevent a stroke (brain damage)."	what are the symptoms of high blood pressure?

1. be a good role model. if you want your child to eat healthfully exercise regularly and limit time in front of the tv or computer… start by doing these things yourself. 2. do a preconception visit. pre-pregnancy health affects your pregnancy and your growing baby. see your health practitioner before you are pregnant. aim for your ideal body weight (bmi) before pregnancy. 3. know your bmi. it stands for body mass index. and it tells you if you are at risk for health-related consequences of obesity. check yours and your child’s. make lifestyle changes if that number is too high. i know it is easier to say than to do. 4. trust yourself. you have the skills to be a good parent. really. 5. happy parents have happy children. take time for yourself and for your marriage. you’ll be amazed by the results. 6. vaccines are safe. they protect your child from diseases you don’t want her to have. seriously. get your child vaccinated. i wouldn’t do anything different with my own kids. 7. you are planting the seeds of discipline. do not expect a tree to grow overnight. it will take months or even years to see the results of your calm and consistent discipline techniques. don’t give up. 8. sleep is underrated. it rejuvenates the body and mind. make it a priority for you and your child. establish a healthy sleep routine and stick to it. let your baby self-soothe when he is old enough to do so (around 4-6 months of age). it’s a critical life skill. 9. it takes a family. you don’t have to do-it-all to win parent of the year. share responsibilities between your partner and your kids (as they become old enough to help out). remember happy parents have happy children. 10. floss.	what are your top ten parenting tips?
the exact amount of protein and fat you need depends on the number of calories you need each day which in turn is based on factors such as your height and activity level. protein should make up about 10% to 35% of your total calories a day. so in general women need about 50 grams of protein each day. that’s honestly not hard to get especially if you eat meat. protein is good for satisfying hunger so it’s safe to include a little more if that helps. a 3-ounce piece of meat has 21 grams of protein. even a cup of beans has 16 grams. and a cup of yogurt has 11 grams. fat should make up 20% to 35% of your total calories. so if you’re eating 1500 calories per day you want to eat less than about 60 grams of fat. and of course make sure it's the good fat sources that you're eating like nuts avocados and olive oil. food labels are a good way to see how many grams of protein and fat are in your food. but keep in mind the 2000-calorie diet that’s often referred to on food labels is too much for most women unless you’re very physically active.	how much protein and how much fat is a woman supposed to consume every day?

it is very common for all men and women to experience small aches and pains due to muscoloskeletal issues or tissue wear and tear. the analysis of your history and symptoms do not indicate that you have serious neurological issues like als. this is true since all the tests including the mri have been found to be normal. the other possibilities would be that you have a low threshold to pain or they could be due to psychological issues. conditions like fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndromes might also be a possibility. it would be recommended that you consult a rheumatologist and a psychiatrist who can help with proper diagnosis and also proper counseling and behavior management to help you manage and live with the pain. i hope this helps.	last year my right hand often had the cramp from the shoulder until the fingertips. 4 months later my back felt slightly painful like period pain's. 3 months after that the pain went upwards until the end of my neck near to my head it was painful to raise my head up. this year 3 weeks before my chest started to feel heavy and hurtful. both of my back and chest felt as if shards of glasses were slashing along the ribs and spine. short of breath most of the time. now my right leg the calf is having some sort of muscle cramp along the bone just like how it is like with my back. i was told by friends that i walked unstably but i don't drag it though. sometimes forgetful and emotionally unstable. maybe due to the stress. cannot sit or stand or lay down for too long. i'm getting thinner and lost 5 kg i eat a lot. went for mri xray blood test urine test nothing next appointment i'm going to have brain mri and emg. any possibility of me having als? what is wrong with me?
eyes look red or bloodshot when the tiny blood vessels on the surface of the eye (the conjunctiva) expand and become swollen with blood. most often this is due to simple irritation of the eye from allergies dust or dryness. red or bloodshot eyes are also symptoms of many different conditions that affect the eye. for example having a deep red area on the white of the eye may be due to a subconjunctival hemorrhage a usually harmless condition. other eye conditions causing bloodshot eyes include: conjunctivitis (inflammation caused by infection or allergies) blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelash follicles on edges of the eyelids) uveitis (inflammation of the uvea the colored portion and middle layer of the eyeball) corneal ulcers (sores on the cornea created by infection or injury) acute glaucoma (a sudden increase in pressure inside the eye) trauma or eye injury it can be hard to tell if bloodshot eyes are due to a serious condition or not. generally speaking if bloodshot eyes are accompanied by pain an injury a change in vision nausea and vomiting or light sensitivity see a doctor. caus you be blazin teh herb. what causes bloodshot eyes when i workout i get bloodshot eye's when i cry when i'm angry i also take warfrin but i been getting this before i started taking warfrin i have high blood pressure too which i'm taking meds for	what causes bloodshot eyes?
hi for a start many things can contribute to anxiety and anxiety symptoms. in some cases these issues may cause anxiety directly. in other cases your anxiety symptoms may simply become worse. either way in order to effectively cure your anxiety you need to make sure you're avoiding anything that may contribute to the development of anxiety symptoms. that's why you need to make sure that you're drinking enough water. dehydration rarely causes anxiety on its own but if you're not drinking enough water you may be putting yourself at risk for worse anxiety symptoms now and the development of greater anxiety in the future. part of curing anxiety is making sure that you're taking the right steps towards stopping everything that contributes to further anxiety. drinking water is a great example. so its best you do stay hydrated. i do hope this helps you. good luck	does dehydration cause anxiety and depression?
birth control pills are out of your system in a day or two after you stop taking them – which is why you need to take them every single day in order for them to be effective. the injectable forms of birth control such as depo-provera are designed to provide contraception for three months. but it can take up to nine or 10 months to be completely dispelled. after three months since your last injection this form of birth control can no longer be guaranteed as an effective contraceptive.	how long does it take for hormonal birth control (pills or injections) to leave your system once you stop using them?

fever is generally harmless. as a matter of fact fever helps fight infection so it is more therapeutic than dangerous. fevers under 105 in older children is not uncommon. any fever in babies under 6 months are taken more seriously but as the child ages seasoned medical providers do not get excited. certainly not as excited about fever as parents. i have been treating children for over four decades and i have not encountered a fever (alone) that would prompt an er visit but of course that is me. it is not the fever that is the issue but rather the cause of the fever and those other symptoms that accompany the fever. for instance a fever with a severe sore throat could be strep or a fever with a dozen other cold symptoms could just mean a viral infection. a fever with lethargy stiff neck and a very ill-appearing child could be meningitis. roseola a common childhood illness can mount a fever in the 105 range for three days in a row before the characteristic rash appears. during the fever stage this high temp certainly gets attention. fever is probably one of the most misunderstood and improperly treated symptoms (it is not a disease) that people encounter so the more your read about it the better you will be informed and the more comfortable you will be when you see it again. and again. and again. comfort comes with practice but until you can keep you cool when kids are hot you will need to engage the expertise of your friendly medical provider.	my 7 yr. old son's normal fever is 103. 8 when he is ill. at what temp. should i be concerned and take him to the er? . i usually have him take several showers to bring down the temp as well as light clothing fluids and fever reducing meds. this particular time the fever reducing meds are wearing off before i can give him more and the luke warm shower didn't bring down the 103. 8 temp like i expected it to. just concerned how high of a fever constitutes an er visit if it continues to rise and i can't bring it down. thanks

the classic symptom of genital herpes is a cluster of small fluid-filled blisters that break forming painful sores that crust and heal. this process can take several days. but some people get only a rash or small bumps on the skin that appear to be pimples. still others have different symptoms such as painful urination and some women have fluid discharge from the vagina. sores may appear four to seven days after a person is first infected. flu-like symptoms including fever and swollen lymph glands in the groin may also follow the initial infection. symptoms come and go with no set pattern. one person may have an outbreak once a year while another may have one every few weeks. before a flare-up a person may notice an itching tingling or burning sensation in the affected area and there may be sharp pains in the pelvis or down the leg. herpes sores are usually worst the first time they appear. in later outbreaks the sores tend to be less painful and last for a shorter period of time. the symptoms of genital herpes can affect any of the following places on the body: penis scrotum vulva vagina anus urethra thighs buttocks. however many people with genital herpes never have symptoms or they mistake them for another malady such as: a vaginal yeast infection jock itch insect bites hemorrhoids an ingrown hair.	what are the common symptoms of genital herpes?

first you really need to sit down with your physician and his/her team and talk about how to manage your polycystic ovarian syndrome. some baseline labs will help direct you: fasting insulin level fasting blood glucose hgba1c and of course your testosterone. there are medications that can help if you have insulin resistance and have elevated blood glucose levels. metformin is one such medication you should discuss with your doctor. weight reduction is a challenge with pcos. you should go to the pcos association website and communicate with other kindred spirits for support and guidance. it is imperative that you are vigilant about your total carbohydrate intake each day as so many women with pcos have trouble metabolizing carb. try to keep your carb intake to about 150gr per day (as opposed to the common american with 400-600 gr/day) and avoid refined and processed sugars at all costs. stick with whole foods with an emphasis on lean protein and vegetables. combine that plan with cardio and weight training done with intensity intervals and you'll see weight reduction. just make sure you're coordinating with your medical team.	i have polycystic ovarian syndrome and gained 50 pounds despite regular exercise and healthy eating. what can i do?

the prognosis of viral hepatitis for most patients is good. symptoms of viral hepatitis such as fatigue poor appetite nausea and jaundice usually subside in several weeks to months without any specific treatment. in fact virtually all patients with acute infection with hepatitis a and most adults (greater than 95%) with acute hepatitis b recover completely. complete recovery from viral hepatitis means the hepatitis virus has been completely eliminated from the liver by the body's immune system. the inflammation in the liver subsides. the patient develops immunity to future infection with the same virus. the patient cannot transmit the infection to others. unfortunately not all patients with viral hepatitis infections recover completely. five percent of patients with acute hepatitis b infection and 80% of patients with acute hepatitis c infection develop chronic hepatitis. acute viral hepatitis needs no specific treatment. patients who develop chronic infection have chronic viral hepatitis and often need treatment to prevent further liver damage.	what is the prognosis of viral hepatitis?
not necessarily but you can certainly call your doctor for patient-specific advice. breast fed babies (i don't know what you are doing) can go many days without a bowel movement. there is not much fiber in breast milk. formula may be no different. a baby can go 8 times a day or once every 8 days. it does not mean they are constipated. seasoned parents usually find this out; new parents (you? ) may not have this experience. constipation is hard dry stools and it is very unlikely that this is what is going on. you are concerned so just call your doctor for some advice.	5 week old baby hasn't had poopy daiper in almost 3 days should i take her to the docotors?
gluten is the protein fraction of wheat rye and barley. gluten contains several different types of protein each with a different arrangement of amino acids. (proteins are chains of amino acids hooked together. ) it is believed that several of these proteins are responsible for the inflammation that causes celiac disease (also known as sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy). the proteins of rice and corn are different from the proteins in gluten and are made up of differently arranged amino acids. they do not cause inflammation in patients with celiac disease. the arrangement of the amino acids in the proteins from oats is intermediate between those of gluten and the proteins of rice and corn. the most recent studies suggest that oats do not promote inflammation in patients with celiac disease or that only large quantities of oats can do so. one concern with oat flour (and possibly oat bran) is that there may be contamination with wheat rye or barley during the process of milling.	does oat bran contains gluten? is it ok to eat it if i have celiac sprue?

your concern is right. the drug serax-d a combination of serratiopeptidase and diclofenac potassium should not be advised in case of pregnancy or with lactation. although it does cause problems like diarrhea bleeding and rash data is lacking regarding safety in such kids. this may be the personal experience of your gynecologist as they may not have seen any bad effects and so they are using it. but according to literature we should not use it. there is no clear indication of this medicine in your case. use of antibiotics and analgesics can heal the wound. so my conclusive advice is to stop serratiopeptidase and continue the rest of the medicine. please discuss my opinion with the treating doctor and stop the medicine with consent. a little advice for the baby's weight; breastfeed her until six months of age. do not use formula feed. after six months start a cereal-based diet to ensure adequate weight gain. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	"Hello doctor,My wife is 27 years old.

The doctor prescribed Taxim-O 200 (Cefixime) to be taken in the morning and night along with Metrogyl 400 (Metronidazole) three tablets a day and Serax-D (Serratiopeptidase and Diclofenac potassium) to be taken in the morning and night. My wife is currently breastfeeding our 5 months old baby. So, we asked the doctor whether those medications are safe during lactation. She told that it is fine. However, based on what I read on the internet the first two tablets are moderately safe during lactation and may not pose any significant risk to the baby, whereas the third one is contraindicated during lactation. As per the doctor, the third medicine is required for her cure and is safe to take. Can you let me know whether the medications are safe to take during lactation? Can my wife continue breastfeeding normally? Our baby does not take powder milk and was vomiting when we tried bottled milk in the past. We need your valuable inputs.

shortness of breath is an early symptom seen in congestive heart failure patients. swollen ankles and feet is a more serious symptom and may be evidenced by swollen extremities (especially the ankles) and by weight gain. i have known some congestive heart failure victims to gain as much as fifteen pounds in one day. one individual in particular stands out in my mind. she was much younger than 85 years old and took lasix (diuretic) every day to release excess fluid. when swollen extremities and weight gain of at least seven pounds occurred metolazone (known as the turbo pill) was added to the daily regimen for a very short period of time until the acute water build up was under control. although gaining six pounds of weight in two weeks is not in itself a medical crisis it is a sign of fluid retention and justifies being assessed in person by a physician. being 85 years old with overt congestive heart failure symptoms puts this person in a potentially life threatening situation. despite the upsetting emotions that a trip to the e. r. may evoke in this person it is better to be safe than sorry. i suggest that you phone her physician first and then take this person to the hospital for treatment. best wishes for this lady's speedy recovery.	swollen feet and shortness of breath are new symptoms of a 85 yr old who has congestive heart failure. however her oxygen levels are 100%. she has gained 6 pds over the last two weeks and has difficulty eating. we were advised by her physician to observe her (she has a pending appt nxt wk) and she has been taken her medication regularly and has strictly followed her diet. . should this warrant a visit to the e/r? i am trying to avoid additional stress on her since she has alzheimer's and dementia and the goings to the hospital get her confused and she comes back home more fragile than ever.
you can have both medicare and va coverage though they don't work together. medicare won't pay for any care you receive at a va facility. but va benefits can be used to help pay for services that medicare doesn't cover. there's no cost to enrolling in medicare part a so you may as well do that. the possible advantage of enrolling in medicare part b coverage (which pays for outpatient care and does come with a monthly cost of about $104) is that you'll gain access to services outside of the va system. when it comes to covering the cost of prescription drugs the va coverage is in many cases more generous than that of medicare part d so it may or may not be beneficial for you to purchase a part d plan. the best thing to do is talk with someone who can help walk you through your options and help you determine the best course of action for your medical and financial needs. you can get free assistance with medicare by contacting your local state insurance assistance program which you can find by visiting www. medicare. gov/contacts or by calling 1-800-633-4227.	i am covered by the va with a rating of 100%. would i still benefit from medicare or medicaid?

"if you don't get enough calcium from foods you may need to take a calcium supplement. many people ask which calcium supplement they should take. the best supplement is the one that meets your individual needs. calcium supplements are available without a prescription in a variety of types such as tablets capsules chewables and liquids. they are also available in different amounts and doses. the body easily absorbs most brand name calcium products. calcium supplements need to dissolve in the stomach for calcium to absorb. chewable and liquid supplements dissolve well because they break down before entering the stomach. calcium whether from diet or supplements is best absorbed when taken in amounts of 500 — 600 mg or less. taking your calcium all at once however is better than not taking it at all. try to get your calcium-rich foods and/or supplements in smaller amounts throughout the day preferably with a meal. most calcium supplements should be taken with food. eating food produces stomach acid that helps your body absorb calcium. calcium citrate supplements on the other hand absorb well when taken with or without food. side effects such as gas or constipation may occur from calcium supplements. if increasing fluids and fiber in your diet does not solve the problem try another type or brand of calcium. it is important to drink plenty of water (six 8 oz glasses) throughout the day when you are taking calcium supplements. it may require trial and error but fortunately there are many choices. when you take a new calcium supplement start with smaller amounts. for example start with 200-300 mg of calcium a day for a week and drink an extra 6-8 ounces of water with it. then gradually add more calcium each week. look carefully at calcium supplement labels for the serving size. often the amount of calcium shown on the label is the amount you receive in more than 1 tablet or unit. for example the label may show ""calcium 630 mg "" but if you look at serving size it may show ""2 tablets"". choose a calcium supplement with vitamin d added to help you reach the daily intake of vitamin d recommended by your healthcare professional. and finally unless otherwise advised by your health care professional avoid consuming more than 2 500 mg of calcium (food plus supplements) per day. if you are an active woman over 50 reconsider your decision to take a calcium supplement. recent research has shown that supplemental calcium does nothing to prevent fractures in active post-menopausal women and it is associated with increased risk of kidney stones and heart attacks. google to read the studies."	how do i choose a calcium supplement?

strangely enough that is the medical term used by most clinicians. it is a billable code with an icd-9 classification. scarlet fever is due to strep -- the same bacteria that causes strep throat. it is not considered any more dangerous if promptly and accurately diagnosed and treated. the rash of scarlet fever is called a scarletiniform streptococcal eruption if you want a different term. it is bright red (hence the name) and sandpapery rough. later the rash can desquamate (peel) like a sunburn.	is there a medical term for scarlet fever?

"yes. just stop eating. weight loss occurs when your body takes in less than it needs. how fast you lose that 10-15 pounds depends on many factors including how much you weigh right now. a pound of fat is 3 500 calories so if you ate 1000 less calories a day than you need to maintain your ideal weight (about 15 calories per pound of ideal weight) you will lose about two pounds a week. 8 pounds a month. in about 6 weeks you can safely reach your goal. you can lose it faster or slower but when you exercise you can ""reshape"" and look like you lost more. yes. definitely you can lose fat with exercise. start following slow carb diet as i did with out exercise. this diet is little strict but you can definitely follow it and get the best results. it will change your habits all together. below are few rules you can follow: #1 avoid “white” carbohydrates #2 eat the same few meals over and over again #3 do not drink calories #4 do not eat fruits #5 take one day off per week"	can i lose weight without exercising? . if u may please tell me how and how long. i'm looking at 10-15 pounds

it's possible that the estroven may not have had the protective effects that the vet intended. there isn't any real estrogen in it just plant estrogens and a lot different herbs to calm menopause symptoms. that could be part of a cause of the issues. here's a great article on exactly what's in estroven: <link>	what are the long term effects of estrogen overdose in a dog? . my dog was on synthetic estrogen for about 5 years. i used over the counter estroven for humans 1/2 pill daily. my 1st vet was ok with it. she's been off the estrogen for 2 yrs. we have seen 3 more vets since. issues are: she is bald (except for her head) and her rear joints are deteriorating fast. she is 9 yrs old. no success in help for baldness or joint issues. could long term od of estroven be the cause?

nyquil is a nonprescription cough and cold product that is available in a number of different formulations. it typically contains an antihistamine a cough suppressant and a pain reliever/fever reducer. all of these active ingredients should be safe for a person with diabetes. people with diabetes should avoid medications that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine which are decongestants. fortunately pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are typically not included in nighttime cough and cold formulations. nyquil syrup does contain high fructose corn syrup. so it may raise blood sugar levels. if you're considering using nyquil i would recommend using nyquil liquicaps which would not have the same effect on your blood sugar. it's important to note that when treating a cold pharmacists and health care providers match a person's symptoms to the appropriate active ingredients. it may be possible that a multi-symptom product such as nyquil contains more active ingredients than you need to treat your symptoms. talk with your pharmacist who can help you select the best cough and cold product for your symptoms. if you have high blood pressure no. there is cold medicine that can be taken such as coricidan	can a person with type 2 diabetes take nyquil?

first you should know that there is no way that i can tell you for sure who the father of your baby is. but medically you should know that those people are wrong. it is completely possible for you to be impregnated during your period. your period works on a simple cycle: your womb builds up a blood-like lining on the walls of itself that is both cushioning and nutrient-rich; then your ovaries release an egg that waits to be fertilized for a few days or hours depending on the woman (ovulation); then when the egg is not fertilized or the body does not perceive the fertilization the lining falls away and is your period. this last part can happen while you are ovulating or actually after. every woman is different. but most women have 1 week of lining build-up 1 week of ovulation 1 week of waiting then 1 week of period approximately. the only way to know is to have a paternal test done with either a home kit or by a doctor. after the baby is born if your cycle bothers you that much you can have tests done to determine if you ovulate before during or after your period.	i've been told you cannot get pregnant during your period is that 100% true because that would be the only way i am. i got back with my ex on august 7th and started my period the same day. we had sex even with me being on my period and then the period only lasted three days. now i am pregnant and due in april and i'm starting to have doubts because i admit that i was with another man before i got back with my ex and i am currently freaking out that there is a possibility that this baby might not be whose i thought it was this whole time because everyone is telling me you cant get pregnant during your period.
complications of crohn's disease may be related or unrelated to the inflammation within the intestine (such as intestinal or extra-intestinal). intestinal complications of crohn's disease include obstruction and perforation of the small intestine abscesses (collections of pus) fistulae and intestinal bleeding. massive distention or dilatation of the colon (megacolon) and rupture (perforation) of the intestine are potentially lifethreatening complications. both generally require surgery but fortunately these two complications are rare. recent data suggest that there is an increased risk of cancer of the small intestine and colon in patients with longstanding crohn's disease. extra intestinal complications involve the skin joints spine eyes liver and bile ducts. skin involvement includes painful red raised spots on the legs (erythema nodosum) and an ulcerating skin condition generally found around the ankles called pyoderma gangrenosum. painful eye conditions (uveitis episcleritis) can cause visual difficulties. arthritis can cause pain swelling and stiffness of the joints of the extremities. inflammation of the low back (sacroiliac joint arthritis) and of the spine (ankylosing spondylitis) can cause pain and stiffness of the spine. inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) also can occur. sclerosing cholangitis causes narrowing and obstruction of the ducts draining the liver and can lead to yellow skin (jaundice) recurrent bacterial infections and liver cirrhosis with liver failure. sclerosing cholangitis with liver failure is one of the reasons for performing liver transplantation. sclerosing cholangitis frequently is complicated by the development of cancer of the bile ducts.	what are the complications of crohn's disease?

from what you're describing these two events don't seem to be related. if the skin cracking you're now experiencing occurs at a different place on the finger from where the cut was then the cut has nothing to do with what's going on right now. cracking of the skin around the nail area is not an uncommon problem especially in the winter when the air dries out due to artificial heating (using the furnace) or when the hands are placed in water for long periods of time. if you work in a job that requires you to place your hands in water -- particularly any water that contains chemicals such as dishwashing soap disinfectants that sort of thing -- you should be provided with rubber gloves to protect your hands. you also would be well advised to wear rubber gloves at home whenever you work with water to help prevent this skin cracking you're experiencing. it's impossible to say what's causing this exactly. if your health care provider prescribed steroid cream it makes me wonder if he or she diagnosed this as a dermatitis. but i'm not going to speculate here. since the situation is bothering you i'd suggest making another appointment with your primary care provider (or whoever prescribed the steroid cream) to discuss the situation and the diagnosis. your pcp will be able to tell you how to manage this situation. all the best to you! hi as it seems you need to have your hands in water now if you don't need to go to deep try some latex gloves see if this cures your problem that's as long as you don't have a problem with latex. its just an idea. good luck	i cut my finger 2 yrs ago. it healed and then breaks out again when in water too long. what do you think is the problem? . i cut my tip of finger where nail is on a piece of glass about 2 yrs ago. it healed find but then weeks later further down finger seemed to break out. i have been prescribed a steroid cream (fluocinonide) and it clears up within 1-2 days. then when my hand is in water too long it seems to go back to breaking out. skin gets tight and then cracks and peels. what could this be?

the importance of stainless steel equipments in medical industry: what is stainless steel? stainless steel is iron alloy with a specific composition that renders increased resistance to corrosion. steel being an alloy of iron undergoes corrosion when subjected to outside environment. this corrosion is responsible for gradual destruction of materials by converting them into its natural oxides. a minimum of 10. 5 % addition of chromium to a low-carbon steel allows the chromium atoms to combine with oxygen and form a thin layer of oxide called passive layer outside the steel preventing any further surface corrosion. in-addition to carbon and chromium various elements like nickel molybdenum and niobium are added to enhance the corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. if the thin film is cut scratched or disrupted in any other form the steel repairs itself by quickly forming the oxides thus making it more efficient solution to the impending problem of corrosion. stainless-steel in medical industry: these anti corrosion properties of the stainless steel makes it the obvious choice for medical instruments where high degree of quality and precision is required. there are different types of steels which satisfy different amount of needs in medical industry; 304 316 450and 630 stainless steel are some of the most commonly used ones. while the inherent anti-corrosion capacity of stainless steel is considered fit for surgical instruments and appliances the improved medical practices demand a more advanced anti -corrosion capacity. due to their specific nature of the instruments and equipment like operation theatre tables instrument trolleys dressing trolleys and steam sterilizers which serve a multiple purposes have to be built with quality stainless steel that offers a better anti-corrosion property stainless steel 304 is generally used for these purposes. surgical instruments designed today have to be thinner and longer which require materials with increased tensile and fatigue strength. by improving these strengths one has to sacrifice the toughness and ductility as all of these properties are interrelated. stainless steel 465 and 455 can accommodate all these properties thus making them an obvious choice for making instruments of desired quality. source : psbl international	breathed in welding fumes pressure on left side of head confusion and nasal drainage. i was welding on stone steps and there was some type of sealant on the steel part ground it off some left over and melted into fumes while welding i feel confused at times and have a feeling of pressure on back left side of head with nasal drainage. er doctor said it was a cold and gave me cold medicine. i believe he was no help since i do not have insurance. today is third day with this feeling scared it's permanent. started fasting and detoxing to rid body of toxins. advice please! . thanks.

very interesting question. the key here is genetics. to start with while it's true sickle cell disease is most commonly found in african-americans it's also found in africans people from the caribbean central and south america some mediterranean countries and people from india. sickle cell disease refers to an abnormality of the red blood cells that cause them to appear crescent-shaped instead of round. the disease is inherited; parents pass it to their children. when children inherit two sickle genes they have the disease. when a child inherits just one sickle gene they do not have the disease but can pass it to their own child if their partner also carries a sickle gene. so quite simply sickle cell anemia is commonly found in african americans because their ancestors have passed it on to them. the same is true of other diseases that afflict certain populations at a higher rate than others such as the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis -- which occurs most commonly among caucasians. hope this helps!	why is sickle cell anemia common in african americans?

benign brain tumors are noncancerous. malignant primary brain tumors are cancers that originate in the brain. they typically grow faster than benign tumors and aggressively invade surrounding tissue. although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs it will spread to other parts of the brain and central nervous system. benign brain tumors usually have clearly defined borders and usually are not deeply rooted in brain tissue. this makes them easier to surgically remove assuming they are in an area of the brain that can be safely operated on. but even after they've been removed they can still come back though benign tumors are less likely than malignant ones to recur. although benign tumors in other parts of the body can cause problems they are not generally considered to be a major health problem or to be life threatening. but even a benign brain tumor can be a serious health problem. brain tumors damage the cells around them by causing inflammation and putting increased pressure on the tissue under and around it as well as inside the skull.	what's the difference between benign and malignant brain tumors?

"well let's start at the beginning. i'll include some links to more information. the bun (blood urea nitrogen) test basically is used to give an idea of how well your kidneys are working. a ""normal"" bun range for adults is around 6-20 mg/dl. the fact your bun is 21 isn't necessarily reason for concern. many factors (including various medications) can affect the bun result and 21 might even be normal for you. it's hard to say without some past lab results to compare with. serum creatinine ranges in adult men run from about 0. 6-1. 2 mg/dl and for women the range is around 0. 4-1. 0. so it sounds like your creatinine level is within normal limits. a normal bun:creatinine ratio is considered to be 10:1-20:1. your bun/creatinine ratio is slightly elevated but probably no cause for alarm. however your best bet is always to consult a health care provider to discuss these results. what's normal for one person may not be normal for another. that's why we health professionals recommend you get blood work done every year. by comparing past results with current ones we can get a better idea of whether you have a problem developing that needs treatment. since i have no background information on you specifically it's impossible to say if these results deserve further investigation. if you're at all concerned about them you should visit your primary care provider. best wishes to you! no"	a free blood screening = bun of 21; my creatinine serum was 0. 93; and my bun/creatinine ratio was 23. do i call dr.?

"the answer is probably yes. usually individuals at risk for developing liver cancer are those with cirrhosis (advanced liver disease with permanent liver scarring). in other words cirrhosis is a precancerous condition. in fact patients with cirrhosis regardless of the underlying cause are at increased risk of developing liver cancer for example patients with cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis c chronic hepatitis b hemochromatosis alcohol and fatty liver. some of these groups of patients should have periodic ultrasound examinations of the liver as well as blood tests for alpha fetoprotein (a blood test that is produced by liver cancers) to detect the development of liver cancer early. there is one group of patients without cirrhosis that is at risk of developing liver cancer; that group of patients has chronic infection with the hepatitis b virus. a typical patient would be somebody born with hepatitis b infection contracted from his/her mother at birth (common in asia). the baby's immature immune system does not recognize the hepatitis b virus as ""foreign"" and thus tolerates the virus. (the body's immune system does not wage war against the virus. ) the hepatitis b virus is able to multiply and flourish in the body without causing the hepatitis (liver inflammation caused by the immune system) that leads to cirrhosis. however the virus can damage the dna in the liver cells and cause liver cancer. these patients typically have high levels of hepatitis b virus in their blood but normal liver enzymes and normal liver biopsies. such patients should have ultrasound examinations of the liver and alpha fetoprotein blood tests every six months to look for developing liver cancers."	are people who carry the hepatitis b virus but who do not have liver disease or hepatitis at risk for liver cancer?

"alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme produced by the body to help break down certain types of molecules such as proteins. the liver produces most of the alkaline phosphatase in our bodies but the intestines kidneys and bones produce small amounts too. alkaline phosphatase is measured by blood testing. called the ""alp"" test it is useful for diagnosing several diseases and conditions. for example high alp levels can indicate blocked bile ducts in the liver bone disease or celiac disease. low alp levels can indicate certain types of anemias or rarely specific types of cancer. it's worth noting that oral contraceptives (birth control pills) also can cause low alp levels. if you have tested high or low for alkaline phosphatase your healthcare provider will tell you if more testing is required or if there's anything you need to do about the situation."	what is alkaline phosphatase?

prevention of coxsackie virus infections is difficult but possible. with children keeping strict hygienic precautions is almost impossible but good practices such as hand washing after diaper changing or touching infected skin may reduce viral transmission to other family members. attempts to regularly clean items that children contact especially toys pacifiers and any items they may place in their mouths may also reduce viral transmission. hand washing in general is the best prevention technique. currently there is no vaccine available. pregnant women should avoid contact with children (or adults) with hfmd because some studies suggest that coxsackie virus may cause developmental and other defects in the fetus. although infection and resolution of the disease usually renders the person immune to reinfection with the viral type that initiated the disease the person is not immune to other coxsackie viral types. for example a person may become immune to coxsackie viral type b4 but still would be susceptible to all of the other coxsackie viral types. in addition other viruses such as enterovirus 71 and enteric cytopathic human orphan (echo) viruses can produce hfmd symptoms. consequently it is possible for some people to have multiple infections with hfmd symptoms even though repeated infections occur infrequently.	can coxsackie virus infections be prevented?

i have had a similar problem with redness in my groin area where the pantie line is. but my doctor tells me that when i shower make sure i am dry down there. there is a powder that she ordered for me and it is called nystatin and it works wonders. my redness got better within 3 or 4 days. i have also used a antifungal cream that i got over the counter at my local drugstore and it is called miconazole. you can get this over the counter where you would buy the women products. i would put this on after i have bathe and dried the area that i needed to dry. and with a thin glove like you would use when you put hair color on i would rub a small amount into the area and i would do it again. then i would let it dry for about 5 minutes or so. then i would get dress. i would do this in the morning and at night for about a week and then it would be gone. i told my doctor about this and she said that i had a rash or a yeast infection cause i was sweating too much. and most people do sweat some more than others. if this problem is not better after trying this then i would definitely go to a doctor you trust or your primary physician if you haven't been to a doctor for this then go and see what the doctor says and if he or she says that it could be a yeast infection you can always buy something over the counter for yeast infection. but if you have a bacterial infection then you would need a antibiotic and that you would have to see your doctor. i wouldn't think that this is bacterial but it might be a good thing to go to your doctor just to make sure that it isn't something that you came in contact with. most of the time its not serious but they can tell usually by looking at it and sometimes it may have to be swapped. but if you do have a bad order or smell my guess is that it is yeast infection and you can get help and it will go away. i would say don't worry but i know you will and if this is painful itching redness with a bad odor and it may have pus then please go to your doctor. and if you don't have one then go online and see what family doctors you have in your city and check the reviews and see what other patients think of this doctor. i do. and it has helped me a lot. please let us know what you did and how it came out. i wish you the best.	i have a smooth red rash on both sides of where testicals touch thigh. by end of day it has a stinky film. i have the same thing going on in my belly button. in addition i have small red blotches on my abdomen and chest that come and go. i have had these conditions for over a year
this is great time to get a flu shot for your baby. this season the flu vaccine is being recommended for all individuals 6 months and older. for children under 9 years old who have not received a flu vaccine before it is recommended that they receive two doses (1 month apart) in order to have maximum immunity this season. the sooner you get the first round the sooner you can get the second. the flu vaccine won't prevent you from getting sick with the common cold or stomach flu but it can provide up to 80-90% protection against influenza which is a virus responsible for many deaths and hospitalizations each winter season. side effects are minimal -- possibly some redness or soreness at the site or a mild fever for a day. the injectable flu vaccine is made from a killed virus so there is no chance of your baby catching the flu from the flu vaccine. i hope some of this information is helpful. your pediatrician should be able help answer your questions as well. i always remind my families that the more close contacts who receive the flu vaccine the better insulated from the flu their baby will be.	my 6 1/2-month-old has not been vaccinated for flu yet and his doctor says he should be. what is your advice?

it seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called 'nissen fundoplication'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery 'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to 'burp' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called 'endoscopic fundoplication'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.	my brother is 23 years old and has severe cerebral palsy for the last few years he has been complaining of stomach pains but was not able to explain what sort of pains as he also has limited speech. about two years ago he became anaemic and was taken into hospital. while he was there he had an endoscopy and the test revealed that he had severe grade 3 erosive/ulcerative oesphagitis. to treat this he was given lansoprazole two years later he still has not recovered and he is still suffering from the same symptoms. the doctors have said that nothing can be done about it and to carry on taking the medication given. after reading an article about endoscopic fundoplication i am wondering whether my brother would benefit from this. i am very concerned as my brother is in a lot of pain which is also causing sleepless nights and now he seems to have developed laughter attacks which can go on for hoursâ¦doctors have not been able to diagnose this but the attack always occur when he is pain. i would be grateful if anyone could give any suggestions. thankyou dyer

many patients with psoriatic arthritis have feelings of anxiety and isolation. these feelings of anxiety can lead to poor sleep which can result in more pain and fatigue the next day. dwelling on the anxiety and fears can lead to feelings of sadness and make you want to be alone as you stay isolated from family and friends. depending on where it is on your body psoriasis alone can be an embarrassing disease and a source of anxiety. you may feel like your psoriasis skin condition interferes with your relationships. perhaps people treat you differently because of the skin condition. new acquaintances may not understand psoriasis and feel frightened by it. even your good friends or family members may refuse your offers to help them out in the kitchen. in addition you may avoid relationships or feel like some people avoid you. when you combine the emotional toll of psoriatic arthritis with the pain and other discomfort you feel this illness can be difficult to manage on your own. coping with psoriatic arthritis can increase stress -- and then the increased stress response only worsens the skin condition. there's even some scientific evidence that worrying about your psoriasis may make treatment less effective. this can become a vicious cycle that creates even more problems including: difficulty sleeping leading to constant fatigue. inability to exercise leading to poor aerobic and physical fitness. difficulty concentrating from the side effects of medications leading to poor performance. increased irritability from lack of sleep or medication side effects. withdrawal from favorite activities because of low energy. changes in appetite due to medications. depression.	does psoriatic arthritis lead to anxiety and isolation?

"the objective of a "" clean catch "" is for the urine not to pick up any bacteria from outside the body. when the urine passes from the body through the urethral meatus (the external opening to the urethra which is located just above the vagina) the stream could contact the labia and pick up bacteria from them. to perform a clean catch you separate the labia with your fingers then wipe down and away with the provided antimicrobial wipes to cleanse the area. usually you wipe more than once. this removes all external bacteria from the path of the urine. next you start the urine stream then move the cup into the stream for a clean catch. this way the urine washes away if you will any external bacteria from the urethral meatus. thus the urine specimen contains only cells and possible bacteria from within the bladder and urinary tract itself. this enables the health care provider to diagnose abnormal bacteria or a urinary tract infection (bladder infection). i hope that explains things for you!"	why is it necessary to hold the labia open for clean catch midstream collection?

i can't find any studies on eosinophilic esophagitis and bariatric surgery (gastric bypass) specifically so i don't know if it's been done before. however the fact your prospective surgeon said he wouldn't do it should be something of a red flag for you. i'd suggest you consult two or three other bariatric surgery specialists in your area to see what they say. you may find someone who has plenty of experience with the situation you describe and is willing to do the surgery or you may find they all advise against doing the surgery. then you'll have your answer. as you probably know there are many types of bariatric (weight loss) surgery besides gastric bypass. this webmd slideshow goes over several types of weight loss surgery. good luck to you!	is it possible to get gastric bypass surgery with eosinophilic esophagitis? . i have eosinophilic esophagitis and i am trying to get gastric bypass. i was told by 1 doc that i can't get it done because he doesn't know enough about the ee and might pose additional problems. any insight on this and has it been done before?

the main symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) include: persistent heartburn. heartburn is an uncomfortable feeling or burning pain behind the breastbone. it may occur after eating soon after lying down or when bending forward. nonprescription medicines that reduce or block acid may relieve the pain. these include antacids (for example tums) h2 blockers (for example pepcid ) and proton pump inhibitors (for example prilosec otc). heartburn caused by gerd is usually felt within 2 hours after eating. if your heartburn lasts for several hours-for example all night-you may have severe gerd. 2 a sour or bitter taste in the mouth. the backflow of stomach acid and juices into the esophagus may be severe enough to cause a sour or bitter taste in your mouth. this often occurs along with heartburn but in some cases it may be your only symptom. if these symptoms occur more than twice a week you may have gerd. many people have occasional heartburn or a sour taste in the mouth. these instances are not considered to be gerd. some people have gerd without heartburn. other symptoms of gerd can include: chest pain. this may be a dull heavy discomfort that spreads across the chest. this chest pain may occur with heartburn and may be confused with the pain of a heart attack. for more information on chest pain and heart attack see the topic chest problems. hoarseness. trouble swallowing. this is more common with advanced gerd. a feeling that you have something stuck in your throat. a cough. having extra saliva (this is called water brash). nausea. there are many other conditions with symptoms similar to gerd such as peptic ulcer disease or an infection of the esophagus. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what are the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd?

we are here to help you. from the way you are describing it seems either you had an arrhythmia that time or you had angina pain. since your blood pressure and heart rate are in normal ranges without medicines you should avoid any medicines at this time. i would recommend for you a treadmill test that is a stress test to rule out any angina on exertion. if that comes out to be normal then you would need to go for holter monitoring. take antacid drug like omeprazole for this purpose as this would help you in fighting with acidity as a cause of chest pain. however acidity is very unlikely to be a cause for that. i hope it helps you. revert back after the tests to a cardiologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am 37 years old and normally take Hydrochlorothiazide for diastolic blood pressure and Zebeta for S node dysfunction. I am also on Metformin. My A1c is 6.1. Two days ago, I started experiencing dull cramping chest pain that was not continuous. I went to the ER and all the tests came back fine (chest x-ray, EKG and blood work). He did not know what was the cause for my pain. They gave me Nitro pill and Nitro paste on my chest which decreased the amount of pain. Up on  release, my blood pressure was 101/55 mmHg and pulse 61.  I had not taken my pills on the day this occurred or the last two days. It has been running around 104/63 mmHg and pulse 69. My diastolic BP without medicine usually runs around 95.

"this is a good question and you're wise to think in terms of avoiding the spread of any contagious condition. the good news is perioral dermatitis isn't contagious. dermatitis means skin (derm) inflammation (itis). because dermatitis is simply an inflammation of the skin (though it's often accompanied by cracking and flaking) it's not something you spread to someone else. the ""perioral"" part of your diagnosis merely denotes the location of the dermatitis. ""peri"" being ""around "" and ""oral"" being ""the mouth. "" skin inflammation around the mouth. that's all it is. all that said you still may want to keep your makeup brushes to yourself. cracked flaky inflamed skin creates a route for someone else's viruses (like oral herpes) or bacteria to enter your skin. you can't spread your dermatitis to someone else but that doesn't mean someone else couldn't spread an infection to you. wishing you well!"	can perioral dermatitis spread on make-up brushes?

hepatitis b is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. in infected individuals the virus can be found in the blood semen vaginal discharge breast milk and saliva. hepatitis b is not spread through food water or by casual contact. in the united states sexual contact is the most common means of transmission followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs tattooing body piercing or acupuncture. additionally hepatitis b can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood. hepatitis b also may be spread from infected mothers to their babies at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). this is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis b rates are high. the rate of transmission of hepatitis b from mother to newborn is very high and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis b. fortunately transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis. rarely hepatitis b can be transmitted through transfused blood products donated livers and other organs. however blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.	how is the hepatitis b virus spread (transmitted)?

no one knows what causes brain tumors; there are only a few known risk factors that have been established by research. people who receive radiation therapy to the head as a child have a higher risk of a brain tumor over the next 20 to 30 years. people who have certain rare genetic conditions such as neurofibromatosis -- a disorder of the nervous system -- or li-fraumeni syndrome -- a condition that predisposes someone to developing cancer -- are also at higher risk. but radiation therapy or rare genetic disorders are only a factor in a small number of the approximately 35 000 new primary brain tumors diagnosed each year. finally age is a factor. the rate of developing brain cancer is four times the rate each year in people over the age of 65 than in people younger than 65.	what causes brain tumors?
you can start with his primary care provider but a pulmonologist is the lung specialist that he may eventually need to see. there are many many different causes of a cough so see the primary care provider first. hi things to think about can he remember what product he was using when this first showed up? i think your find his myocarditis was from the pneumonia from what i can read about it. below is some info i have found about his problem and i think this has transgressed from there. chemical pneumonia is an unusual type of lung irritation. pneumonia usually is caused by a bacteria or virus. in chemical pneumonia inflammation of lung tissue is from poisons or toxins. only a small percentage of pneumonias are caused by chemicals. many substances can cause chemical pneumonia including liquids gases and small particles such as dust or fumes also called particulate matter. some chemicals only harm the lungs; however some toxic materials affect other organs in addition to the lungs and can result in serious organ damage or death. chemical pneumonia is only one type of lung inflammation. other types of lung infections are viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. chemical pneumonia is a type of lung irritation. many substances can cause chemical pneumonia including liquids gasses dust fumes and lung aspiration. symptoms and signs of chemical pneumonia include burning eyes lips mouth throat dry cough nausea abdominal pain chest pain headache and pleuritis. treatment of chemical pneumonia depends on the toxic and amount of exposure. hi for me unless he’s the boss then this is his health were talking about time for a new start in another job away from chemicals fumes dust and all the rest that goes with the job working in a body shop. if you love your husband like you do then there is no other way he can go he may have a big love for his job but his job in slowly killing him . has he thought of still being in the industry but working from the other side ie not in the workshop. its either this or he works in a full face mask which would be fed by oxygen so he’s breathing clean air all the time he is in the workshop this could be a way out for him to carry on working in a body shop. as for finding what was the cause then that's how this answer started. do hope this helps in some way good luck hi his first call would be his own doctor and let him/her take it from there its either that or get him to an er. does he not wear a dust mask at work with all this dust? he really needs to watch this i had a college many years ago a tiller just as dusty he went off one and we never sore him again his close buddy when he come back said he was dead it was from the dust it had built up in his throat causing it to close end of story. so please be warned. good luck to add to the question yes he uses a dust mask at work however the fumes and dust do not get completely caught by the mask. in 2004 he was hospitalized due to a combination of pneumonia and working in the body shop. basically the pneumonia didn't get better and developed into myocarditis and he wound up in the heart unit at the local hospital over christmas. it all started with a cough much like the one he has now. he was put on all kinds of antibiotics for bronchitis and pneumonia but none of them seemed to work and he was put on an inhaler at one point which made his heart race and eventually led to me taking him to the e. r. at 4 in the morning on christmas eve where we were told he was having a heart attack at the ripe old age of 28. later it was discovered that it was not a heart attack but myocarditis. we are trying to get to a specialist sooner rather than later on this and find out if he is just allergic to the chemicals in the paint/primer that is used and if so what can be done about that. a change in careers isn't really an option so we need to find some answers at this point. all suggestions are appreciated. thanks.	what doctor to see for chronic cough. my husband is a bodyman (collision repair on automobiles) and works all day with paint and primer fumes as well as the body dust that goes along with his profession. he has developed a constant cough - he can barely complete a sentence without coughing. it sounds like a bronchitis cough but always gets better over the weekend when he's not at work. then by lunchtime on monday it's back with a vengeance and he's coughing all the time. what type of doctor should he see for this cough?

"you're smart to think about your blood sugar before it gets out of control. as you probably know the hemoglobin a1c test measures your blood sugar control over the preceding three months. it's a very good indicator for helping people with diabetes manage their condition better. a normal a1c range is between 4% and 5. 6%. an a1c result between 5. 6% and 6. 4% indicates you are at risk of developing diabetes. and an a1c result over 6. 4% indicates you have diabetes. you are at the low end of the at-risk category so you are starting in a good place. my best tips for managing blood sugar in the ""at-risk"" stage are: lose weight if you're overweight. this alone can lower your a1c. exercise if you don't already. all you need to do is walk. it's that simple. start with 10 minutes a day. indoors or out. just walk. work your way up to 30 minutes of vigorous walking 5 times a week. don't consume a lot of sugar. ditch the soda. read labels. sugar lurks in places you wouldn't dream of! you don't need to swear off sugar forevermore. just be mindful of your sugar intake. eat a healthy diet that is rich in fiber (plant foods) protein and healthy fats. that's pretty much it. if you do those four things chances are your next a1c will be smack in the normal range. wishing you well! thank you"	how do i lower my hemoglobin a1c (hba1c). its 5. 8 im not a diabetic. im a 51 years old female

"losing weight is a challenge. although it seems that you're doing every right your body thinks that it's being starved and goes into a metabolic slowdown. i suggest the ""weight watchers"" website as a good place to start your dieting process anew. their website has meal planning and dieting hints. the cost to join is reasonable and all tasks necessary to be successful can be accomplished on-line. their foods are available in most larger supermarkets and have literally hundreds of food choices. weight watchers has a point system assigned to different foods which makes even dining out in restaurants possible. books new and used are available on- line for weight watcher (including books that detail point values for many foods) to ensure that you're following the program correctly. i have no personal interest in weight watchers except to share the best dieting information that is available. of all the major diet plans weight watchers consistently has the highest satisfaction ratings. even my doctor whom i have known for 25 years recommends weight watchers to his patients. as far as pills and medications go most seem to be just fads that ultimately fail the dieting individual. one newer supplement garcinia cambogia shows some promising results from anecdotal accountings by its users. - your exercise time seems to acceptable for weight loss and ultimate weight maintenance. i would obtain some information on exercising to lose weight through books and pamphlets available on - line. even though you're investing what appears to be the correct time to exercising it is important to do the exercises that will work best for your dieting objectives. walking is a great way to burn calories. walking also has the additional benefits of viewing spring flowers the sky and the birds. don't forget to stop and talk with the neighbors. it is therapeutic to forge new friendships that will support your dieting program. - my first step before starting any dieting program would be to receive medical clearance and recommendations from my doctor. - you may also consider joining a support group to bolster your knowledge about dieting and hear success stories from other people just like us that lost weight. it can be done."

you mention that you have a family history of high cholesterol so you may just have a genetic predisposition to having high triglycerides and high ldl cholesterol. that doesn’t mean however that you shouldn’t try to do everything that you can through modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as diet and exercise to manage your levels. some suggestions to lower your triglycerides and ldl cholesterol levels would be to: • do cardiovascular exercise five times per week for thirty minutes or greater • lose weight if you are overweight or obese according to bmi • change dietary habits like reducing saturated and trans fat from your diet cutting out sugar getting more fiber getting more omega-3 fatty acids and drinking less alcohol if you drink • quit smoking if you smoke i really applaud your efforts to avoid getting on cholesterol lowering medication. continue to do what you can with diet and exercise and continue to follow up with your doctor on a regular basis. it might sound strange but i had triglycerides over 1000 and got them to normal range with lots of black tea and 5000 mg of epa dha (omega-3) fish oil supplements daily. the fish oil was at my mds advice but didn't seem to work until i started drinking plain black tea in place of water - 5 tea bags in 64+ oz water daily.	i have high triglycerides and high ldl's and i'm in excellent physical shape. how do i lower these levels without meds? . high cholesterol htn etc. all run in my family. i cut out red meats and non-whole wheat breads and pastas for about 6 weeks without any change. i would like to find a way to drop my cholesterol w/o going on meds. my entire family is on various cholesterol and bp meds but they're all overweight and refuse to diet/exercise. is this something i can beat w/o meds? if i continue on with high levels throughout my life would i be able to mitigate the risks of heart disease diabetes and so on?

you make a fair point. it's true that while the premiums are reasonable for people who qualify for a subsidy many plans do come with high out-of-pocket costs. you can decide to pay the penalty -- that is an option. just keep in mind that these plans allow you to obtain preventive services at no cost at the time of the visit. and if you have an accident or are diagnosed with a serious illness even the high deductible will be immeasurably less expensive than paying for care out-of-pocket.	with the subsidies my cost of health insurance premiums should be below $200 a month. . yet with $6 000 in deductibles it doesn't sound like i can afford to go to the doctors even if i need to. doesn't it make more sense for me to just take the $95 tax penalty and save $2 400 premiums and out-of-pocket expenses of $6 000? if i have to pay $8 400 each year toward medical expenses i cannot afford to live in my home of 23 years.
"a number of dietary supplements are being studied for their potential beneficial effects in people with ulcerative colitis. omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil reduced symptoms and prevented the recurrence of uc in at least one study. other studies however have not had the same results. probiotics are ""good"" bacteria or other microorganisms that can be beneficial to your health. in several studies they have been seen to reduce ulcerative colitis symptoms. the thinking is that probiotics like lactobacillus or live-culture yogurt help to restore balance to the good bacteria that live inside the intestines. a few studies have noted the therapeutic effect of aloe vera taken in the form of an oral gel. more research is needed to verify and identify its benefits. also the spice turmeric may help people with ulcerative colitis stay in remission. one study found that people who took turmeric were less likely than others to relapse. other supplements are also being studied to see if they can be effectively used to manage ulcerative colitis. your doctor can help you find out more about the studies."	what supplements are being studied that might help people with ulcerative colitis?

after being diagnosed with cirrhosis the development of a fever can be a sign of liver complications and should be medically assessed. your physician should be consulted before taking any over the counter medications such as acetaminophen aspirin ibuprofen vitamins and other supplements. a good practice when first diagnosed is to put all the bottles of all the medications you take into a bag and take them with you to the doctor who manages your liver disease. include all over-the-counter medications supplements and herbal drugs as well as any prescriptions you take. individuals with cirrhosis get aches and pains and may develop a fever just like anybody else. clear treatment instructions should be obtained before these incidents occur. never start any new medications or supplements without first checking with your doctor. any time you are being prescribed a new medication make sure the doctor prescribing it is aware of your liver condition. most pain and anti-pyretic (fever reducers) drugs are metabolized by the liver. with cirrhosis the failing liver does not always break down these drugs which then may build up in the bloodstream to toxic levels. alcohol prescribed medications vitamins and over the counter medical remedies can cause further hepatic damage and should be taken only upon the approval of the doctor treating your cirrhosis.	what is safe to take for fever if you have cirrhosis. my husband is in stage 4 and has a fever what is safe for him to take?

plyometrics is a very dangerous method of exercising. there are no exceptions and the damage is cumulative. plyometrics involve jumping and landing both involving high acceleration and impact forces. my premise is that all injuries (i. e. tissue damage) are caused by the application of forces that exceed the structural tolerances of the tissues injured. a bone fracture is an obvious example. simply put plyometrics exposes a trainee to injury level forces and this is unnecessary to gain the adaptive benefits of exercise. the problem is not just limited to the spectrum of acute athletic injuries. those high level forces that are not high enough to cause catastrophic tissue failure can still proceed to damage structures like articular cartilage and loosen joint systems (muscle insertions ligaments musculotendinous junctions) in a sub-clinical way. this risk is elevated because of the risk of slipping due to the nature of the exercise. these repeated impact forces contributes to chronic degenerative disease with osteoarthritis as the ultimate result. articular cartilage can be slowly and significantly damaged over time and this has now been shown on runners where sequential mris were done over about 4 years. many people do not know that this asymptomatic damage is irreversible and over time this cumulative damage becomes debilitating.	what are the risks of plyometric exercises?

tsh is thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. tsh stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormone into the blood. thyroid hormone maintains normal metabolism growth body temperature and many other essential bodily functions. blood levels of tsh and thyroid hormone are maintained in a tight balance. high levels of thyroid hormone cause the pituitary to reduce the release of tsh. low levels of tsh lead the pituitary to release more tsh. this in turn stimulates the thyroid gland which produces more thyroid hormone which reduces the tsh level. this relationship is called a negative feedback loop. doctors use the blood tsh level as a screening blood test for thyroid function: high tsh usually means an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). low tsh is usually due to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). in people being treated for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism tsh also provides information on the success of treatment.	what is tsh?

i am very sorry to hear that you are sick but your specific question is not one that can be answered in this type of information forum. if you have had diarrhea for 4 days and are having severe pain you really do need to see a doctor now. symptoms such as this can have many causes ranging from a virus food poisoning or diverticulitis all the way to a surgical emergency. there is no way to tell what is going on without a physical exam and more information. any treatment will depend on what is causing your symptoms. start by calling your family doctor now. explain your symptoms. tell the doctor that you are unemployed and are having money problems. most doctors that i know will try to help you by reducing the fee or working out some type of payment plan. he or she will also know what resources are available in the area and can give you further advice. if you do not have a family doctor your city or county may have a free clinic. but this will only help you if you can be seen right away. some areas have urgent care centers that may be able to see you right away for a fee. if there is no way that you can see a doctor right now then you can go to the emergency room of your local hospital. once this health crisis has passed look into whether you can get help from the government. you are eligible for medicare if you are over 65. if you are younger and meet certain financial criteria you may be able to get medical assistance. i hope you get the help you need now.	do you know what i could have or best thing to fix this diarrhea that i have had for days now? . i have had diarrhea now for 4 days i have tryed pepto bismol and its not working. i also have severe pains and nausea with it. now im very sore and raw down there when i go it burns and hurts. what could this be or what is best to use? . any help would be appreciated because im not working and cant afford to go to doctor and get meds both.

most helpful answer i don't have enough details about your case to comment but testicles that do not descend by age 6-8 years old can be very problematic. i would suggest that you see your medical provider or a urologist for a careful examination and some diagnostic tests to determine what is going on in your case.

i read your query and understood your concern. as per your diagnosis of anxiety and panic attacks there should be no doubt whether you need neurologist or psychiatrist. both these conditions come under the domain of psychiatrist and they are more able to treat these conditions. other than anxiety and panic attacks you have got addiction problem because of the wrong use of medicines. in my view there is no role of soltus in case of anxiety and panic attacks. if you feel fine with an online psychiatry consultation session (via phone or video chat) then i will be happy to help you. you con contact me by either putting a detailed query or booking an online consultation.	Dear Doctor,I am suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for the last 3 years.I went to a neurologist 2 years back and he advised me to take REXIPRA 10 for 3 months, SOLTUS 50 for 6 months, HEMIDAP PLUS for 9 months & ZEPAM .5 for 12 months.

at age 19 there is a very good chance that you have stopped growing. your growth plates may have already closed so the chance of you achieving more height may be futile. our height is genetically-determined for the most part so the day you were conceived your dna was already been programmed for your adult height. you can see an endocrinologist and get an x-ray to see if your growth plates have closed. if they have you are at your adult height now. there is nothing medically that can change this so don't waste money on unproven treatments or quackery. there are no rules that state a son will follow the height pattern of the father. you may end up splitting the difference between your parents. my mother was 61 inches tall; my father was 74 inches tall. i am 70 inches; my youngest brother is 63 inches and my oldest brother is 73 inches. my son is 75 inches.	i am male born in 1994(19). my height is 163 i wanna grow atleast 173. is that possible for me if yes than please tell? . my father and younger brother having height of around 170. my mother is having height of 157.
it is difficult to answer all your queries without examination and tests done on you. i will try and answer a few of them: is oral herpes a localized infection that only sheds from previously infected areas or can it systemically shed from any skin? â---- hsv can affect the whole body and have localized outbreaks. my partner has a history of oral outbreaks but not genital outbreaks but received oral sex from the person who gave him herpes should we consider his genital area infected? â---- yes he can shed the virus through his body fluids. if my partner kisses intact skin on my face / body that is not a mucus membrane nor genital area is there a risk of infection? if i kiss my partners face (not around the mouth) what is the risk? â--- risk of transmission is less with contact with intact areas and non mucous areas. if my partner has clean hands is there a risk of transmission if he touches my genitals? â----- yes it can be considered safe. can hsv1 be transmitted in sweat blood or semen? â---- yes it can be easily transmitted by blood and semen. transmission through sweat is rare and not heard of. is there any test for degree of asymptomatic shedding? â----no a person can remain asymptomatic and still be able to transmit the infection. if the person is on regular treatment then the viral load gets reduced. how contagious is hsv1? am i statistically in for it if i continue? ------the possibility that you have already contracted the infection cannot be ruled out. visit your doctor/gynecologist for confirmation of the infection by tests. get started on prophylactic treatment. take care.	i (girl) have begun dating a man who has oral herpes hsv1. i have talked with two doctors about the situation gotten wildly different takes and have not found all the answers i want online. - is oral herpes a localized infection that only sheds from previously infected areas or can it systemically shed from any skin? - my partner has a history of oral outbreaks but not genital outbreaks but received oral sex from the person who gave him herpes should we consider his genital area infected? - if my partner kisses intact skin on my face / body that is not a mucus membrane nor genital area is there a risk of infection? if i kiss my partners face (not around the mouth) what is the risk? - if my partner has clean hands is there a risk of transmission if he touches my genitals? - can hsv1 be transmitted in sweat blood or semen? - is there any test for degree of asymptomatic shedding? - how contagious is hsv1? am i statistically in for it if i continue? thank you!

hi and no chance not that quick you need to read up about your cycle and understand how its works. your problem may stem from stress thinking i have had unprotected sex and i'm going to get pregnant one it was the wrong time of the month and the reason your on bc pills is not to get pregnant having unprotected sex. your find if you read up on the bc pill its about 1% who just may get pregnant but not one day before there period. ok feel better? good luck ps do some reading about your period your cycle and the bc pill.	can i be pregnant? on birth control pills. i have been on the pill for over a year. take it pretty regularly (maybe 1/2 to 1 hour off). last week i had sex without a condom a day before my period. got my period like normal the next day. its been a week now and my stomach seems a bit off with mild cramping. could this be pregnancy?

harmful? no but often unnecessarily. i agree with you. just take the medication that you need to help control the annoying symptoms. some combination cold medications do not even make sense. including a decongestant that drains mucous combined with an antihistamine that dries it up and a cough expectorant that makes you cough combined with a cough suppressant that stops the cought! that is really like taking kaopectate and a laxative at the same time.	is it bad for you to take medication that does not relate to your symptoms? . for example day quil severe cold and flu has acetaminophen (pain reliever/fever reducer) dextromethorphan hbr (cough suppressant) guaifenesin (expectorant) and phenylephrine hcl (nasal decongestant). to reiterate my question would it be harmful to take this if you really only need the expectorant suppressant and decongestant (or some other combination) to treat your symptoms?

well the thing is you don't want to put ice on it. if you put ice on it believe it or not the burn is kind of open skin in some cases so ice will actually adhere to the skin. so when you try to take the ice off of it you will rip layers of skin with it and possibly cause an infection. the recommendation is really to use tepid or cool water; not super cold but right in the middle and submerse the area. butter and mayonnaise to me are like wives' tales. people believe that they should be putting some type of ointment on it to help replace the moisture in the skin. that is not the case. we found out in a lot of cases now that you need to let the air get to it and let it heal by itself because when they were putting things like ointments and creams on it it was trapping in bacteria leading to skin infections. if you notice though it's blistering and the area is extremely red. you probably need to go and have it looked at by a healthcare provider because there are some prescription ointments and creams that are specifically used for burns.	is it okay to put ice on a burn; what about butter or mayonnaise?

my dad had this illness and it was misdiagnosed as parkinson's for a very long time. below is the best explanation i have read about nigrostiaratal degeneration: striatonigral degeneration (snd) is sporadic middle-aged on set degenerative disease of the nervous system which etiology is unknown. it is usually misdiagnosed as parkinsonism mainly because snd is often present early on with parkinson's disease (pd) symptoms and patients receive some relief from levodopa and dopamine agonists as well as the other medications to treat pd. there are some symptoms that differentiate the two these are: early onset falls severe dysarthria (characteristically slurred and difficult to understand speech) severe dysphonia excessive snoring hyper reflexia and extensor tendon response pet scans and spect scans may show little change in dopamine levels. degenerative changes are seen in putamen region of the brain. medicines include sinemet dopamine agonists eldepryl symmetrel pain medications and medications to treat other symptoms that may arise. this answer was originially given by dr. uzair mbbs fcps (r) general surgery. years of experience in emergency medicine.	what is nigrostriatal degeneration as it relates to parkinson's disease?

"a number of medical associations and organizations have made recommendations on screening for thyroid disease. some of the recommendations are listed below: all women who are planning a pregnancy should be considered for screening of thyroid disease. all pregnant women with a goiter (enlarged thyroid) high blood levels of thyroid antibodies a family history of thyroid disease or symptoms of hypothyroidism should be tested for hypothyroidism. in women who are borderline or sub-clinical hypothyroid and who also have positive antibodies -- which may indicate an ongoing autoimmune thyroid destruction -- therapy with low dose thyroid hormone at the onset of pregnancy may be beneficial. there is some evidence that the antibodies that may contribute to hypothyroidism can play a role in pregnancy. data suggest that selenium supplementation may be of benefit in women with high antibody levels at the time of preconception. this should be reviewed with your doctor. women who are on thyroid hormone replacement before pregnancy should also be tested to make certain that their levels are appropriate. during pregnancy the medication dose required may increase by up to 50%. increases may be required as early as in the first trimester. dosing is dynamic during pregnancy and should be closely monitored by regular blood testing. as the pregnancy progresses many women require higher doses of hormone replacement. the dosage of thyroid hormone replacement during and after pregnancy should be carefully monitored using the blood thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) value. the laboratory ranges for normal tsh are quite wide. most clinicians like to keep women who are pregnant and on replacement in the ""hyper"" end of the normal range. this usually equates to a tsh of 2. 0. many clinicians prefer tsh in the 1. 0 range. in women with hypothyroidism before conception most go back to their pre-pregnancy dose of thyroid hormone within a few weeks to months. it must be stressed that these are only guidelines. the management of each woman's situation is considered individually after consultation with her doctor. the benefits of treatment extend not only to pregnant women with hypothyroidism but also to their children."	what can be done to avoid the consequences of hypothyroidism in pregnancy?

"fibromyalgia and its chronic pain can affect sex and intimacy. fm affects everything else so why shouldn't it cause unique problems with sex and intimacy as well? fm introduces new fears concerns and anxieties into a relationship and we must understand them and address them. first understanding the unique problems fm causes with sex: 1. pain. the physiological equivalent of a cold shower! we hurt all over and any pressure or weight or squeezing aggravates the pain. sex is not supposed to hurt. 2. fatigue. no energy = less sexually active. mental fatigue = decreased motivation = loss of libido = less sexually active. the person with fm may go to bed several hours before the partner and be asleep by the time the partner gets into bed. it is difficult to have successful sexual intimacy when one person is asleep! since sleep is so valuable and so short-lived for many with fibro any deep sleep will be more desired than sex esp[ecially] at 11:30 pm! 3. associated conditions. ibs can cause nausea abdominal pains and more bowel alertness than sexual alertness. depression can cause additional loss of libido interest and motivation. anxiety can interfere with sexual responses. poor self esteem can lead to lack of interest or embarrassment. 4. medicine side effects. ssris can decrease libido or cause sexual dysfunctions including ed [erectile dysfunction] in men. muscle relaxers tricyclics and antiseizure meds can cause extreme sedation. different meds can cause nausea or gi [gastrointestinal] symptoms and shift the focus from the bedroom to the bathroom. so with so much ""negative stuff"" going on with fibro how do we possibly figure out a way to enjoy sex? we focus on the positives of sex rather than the problems. we reassure ourselves that intimacy is good for you your relationship and your fibro. sex can be therapeutic. let's count the ways. 1. it is a physical activity. isn't physical activity good for fibro? ! 2. it increases our body's endorphins. 3. it improves blood flow removes toxins from cells and boosts our immune system. 4. it results in stretching and then relaxation of our muscles. 5. it reduces stress. 6. it re-connects us emotionally and intimately. 7. usually we forget about pain during sexual intimacy! we should reassure ourselves that we are not hurting ourselves by being intimate; rather we are helping both the fibro and the relationship. your partner is also dealing with fears and anxieties about hurting you so you both need to be reassured about the positive aspects of being intimate."	how does fibromyalgia affect sex and intimacy and how can we address these problems?
you cannot self-diagnose colon cancer by symptoms alone. you will need to see your medical provider and have some diagnostic tests. hard bowel movements with blood (bright red i assume) on the toilet tissue is more a sign of a anal fissure (a tiny tear from passing a large hard stool) than cancer. i don't know your age risk factors or family history but if you meet any of the criteria a colonoscopy may be in your future. you have had this issue for three years and have likely worried about cancer so why not see a medical provider or proctologist / colo-rectal specialist and get properly examined?	i've had constipation large hard stool w/ blood on stool & toliet paper bloating paincramping for 3yrs now. coloncancer?

doctors have a wide range of high blood pressure medicines available to rein in galloping blood pressure. these high blood pressure treatments include diuretics? so-called water pills; beta blockers which cause your heart to beat more slowly and with less force; and angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors which block the production of an enzyme that normally causes blood vessels to narrow. a new medication called an angiotensin ii receptor blocker (arb) causes vessels to relax and become wider. as effective as these drugs are at blood pressure control if you get to the point of needing them you will have to take them for the rest of your life. that is one more good reason to focus on prevention.	how is high blood pressure treated?

yeast infections can just happen whether the person is having sex or not. i guess that is is possible for sexual activity to be contributory but it isn't necessary. there is really no way for me to know if your girlfriend has yeast or something else without an examination so if there is a concern she will need to see her medical provider. in the meantime she can treat a simple vaginal yeast infection using monistat vaginal cream or an equivalent product - available over the counter.	my girlfriend develop a yeast infection after we had sex. this is her first occurance in years. could sex have cause it. my girlfriend develop a yeast infection a couple of days after we had sex. this is her first occurance in years. a few weeks before i had sex with her i had protected sex with another woman. could sex have cause it? how do i or we know if its something other than a yeast infection? will it re-appear if we have sex again?

hernias are sometimes mistaken for testicular disease. when a lower part of the abdominal wall muscles are weak part of the intestine can bulge through it. when the intestine pushes into the scrotum it's called an inguinal hernia -- although the scrotum swells and it can appear to be a testicular problem. the solution is surgery to fix the weak part of the abdominal wall.	how can a hernia be mistaken for a testicular disease?

obviously i do not know your wife's medical history and breast cancer risks nor can i examine her and view those mammogram results but i can probably back-up the surgeon's decision. mammograms are not perfect. the only way to get a 100% assurance that this calcification is truly benign is by a pathological specimen. examining it carefully under a microscope by a train pathologist. even a biopsy (a small piece of this calcification) can be wrong so a excisional biopsy is often the best way to go. this way the entire calcified area is removed and examined. if this tissue is benign that you will know conclusively that this area is not cancer you and your wife can relax and will not have to worry that the mammogram missed something. in medicine we have a saying: gone is good. that calcification is now gone it was not cancer and this is good.	is it normal to have benign breast calcification surgically removed? . my wife had the biopsy done and was told that the calcification were benign we had a consultation with a surgeon and they said that even though the test results came back as benign she should still go ahead and have the calcification surgically removed since there is still a chance that tests were wrong even if its almost a non existential chance that the test were wrong. is it normal to have benign breast calcification surgically removed?

your bmi - body mass index is 30. 4 kg/m2. generally we perform bariatric surgery to achieve permanent weight loss for any patient whose bmi is 30 kg/m2 or above. liposuction is not a treatment option for weight loss. it is a cosmetic procedure for body shaping. there is a set point for fat storage for everyone. this is not altered by liposuction. weight loss by liposuction diet control exercise naturopathy amway herbalife etc. is temporary as all these methods do not have any effect on set point for fat storage. so any fat that is removed in liposuction will reaccumulate over a period of 6 months to two years. those who can reduce weight by diet control and exercise does not need liposuction and those who cannot reduce weight by above methods will not reduce even after liposuction. bariatric surgery provides permanent weight loss as it lowers set point for fat storage. if you are looking for permanent weight loss then bariatric surgery is the only scientifically proven method for that. for further information consult a general surgeon online --> <link>	"Hi doctor,I am planning to go for liposuction to lose weight.

while ulcerative colitis causes inflammation only in the colon (colitis) and/or the rectum (proctitis) crohn's disease may cause inflammation in the colon rectum small intestine (jejunum and ileum) and occasionally even the stomach mouth and esophagus. the patterns of inflammation in crohn's disease are different from ulcerative colitis. except in the most severe cases the inflammation of ulcerative colitis tends to involve the superficial layers of the inner lining of the bowel. the inflammation also tends to be diffuse and uniform. (all of the lining in the affected segment of the intestine is inflamed). unlike ulcerative colitis the inflammation of crohn's disease is concentrated in some areas more than others and involves layers of the bowel that are deeper than the superficial inner layers. therefore the affected segment(s) of bowel in crohn's disease often is studded with deeper ulcers with normal lining between these ulcers.	how is crohn's disease different from ulcerative colitis?
baby : congratulations! if your egg and your partner's sperm have joined successfully your embryo is really there although it's very small -- about the size of the head of a pin. it doesn't look like a fetus or baby; it's just a group of about 100 cells multiplying and growing rapidly. the outer layer of cells will become the placenta and the inner layer will become the embryo. mom-to-be : you won't notice any changes. it's too soon. remember you haven't even missed your period yet. tip for the week : home pregnancy tests are about as reliable as a urine test or blood test done in the doctor's office and can give you more immediate results than waiting for a doctor's visit. to ensure accuracy make sure you've read the directions carefully and that all equipment being used is clean.	what can i expect during week 3 of my pregnancy?

if you are rh-negative unless you are given rh immune globulin just before or after a high-risk event such as miscarriage amniocentesis abortion ectopic pregnancy or childbirth you have a chance of becoming sensitized to an rh-positive fetus 's blood. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past if you have been rh-sensitized in the past you must be closely monitored during any pregnancy with an rh-positive partner because your fetus is more likely to have rh-positive blood. in response to an rh-positive fetus your immune system may quickly develop igg antibodies which can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. each subsequent pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus may produce more serious problems for the fetus. the resulting fetal disease (called rh disease hemolytic disease of the newborn or erythroblastosis fetalis) can be mild to severe. mild rh disease involves limited destruction of fetal red blood cells possibly resulting in mild fetal anemia. the fetus can usually be carried to term and requires no special treatment but may have problems with jaundice after birth. mild rh disease is more likely to develop in the first pregnancy after sensitization has occurred. moderate rh disease involves the destruction of larger numbers of fetal red blood cells. the fetus may develop an enlarged liver and may become moderately anemic. the fetus may need to be delivered before term and may require a blood transfusion before (while in the uterus) or after birth. a newborn with moderate rh disease is watched closely for jaundice. severe rh disease ( fetal hydrops ) involves widespread destruction of fetal red blood cells. the fetus develops severe anemia liver and spleen enlargement increased bilirubin levels and fluid retention ( edema ). the fetus may need one or more blood transfusions before birth. a fetus with severe rh disease who survives the pregnancy may need a blood exchange. this procedure replaces most of the infant's blood with donor blood (usually type o rh-negative). a history of pregnancy with rh disease is a sign that you will need special treatment when you are pregnant with an rh-positive fetus. if you have been rh-sensitized in the past an rh-negative fetus cannot trigger an immune reaction. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get rh sensitization during pregnancy?

"paget's disease is a chronic condition of bone characterized by disorder of the normal bone remodeling process. normal bone has a balance of forces that act to lay down new bone and take up old bone. this relationship (referred to as ""bone remodeling"") is essential for maintaining the normal calcium levels in our blood. in bone affected by paget's disease the bone remodeling is disturbed and not synchronized. as a result the bone that is formed is abnormal enlarged not as dense brittle and prone to breakage (fracture). paget's disease affects older skeletal bone of adults. it's estimated that 1% of adults in the u. s. have paget's disease. there is also an extremely rare form of paget's disease in children referred to as juvenile paget's disease. paget's disease is also known as osteitis deformans."	what is paget's disease?

"alcohol as you know is a highly addictive substance and repeated use can lead to oral cancer. baking soda has some benefits but is too abrasive to use regularly. get ""addicted"" to an ada approved toothpaste. craved foods or non-foods = body desperate for missing minerals. eating craved items fails to get minerals the system needs increasing use to perceived ""addiction"". body ""knows"" what's needed seeks what resembles? what's missing. could be salt sugar etc. too. older cultures ate special clays for this: problem solved! pregnant mothers sought special clays--probably higher in magnesium to counter eclampsia. others chose different clays. many have used mezotrace or simply kelp snacks to fix this; either of these have all the minerals in good balance. even just eating lots of veggies helps. mezotrace is a fine powder sprinkles on food usually at health food stores. kelp snacks are sold in lots of stores now--tasty! you will most probably stop craving baking soda once your body gets it's needed minerals. most do; amounts differ per person. one sister literally snowed on her dinner plate with salt; took fresh veggies lost the salt shaker. get needed nutrients only that it does and craves sources of minerals strongly enough to drive serious cravings. i cannot explain how a body knows what to seek out just that it does but often fails to get them due to mans' manipulation of our food sources over time. various clays have been used for this supplementation for thousands of years."	i have become addicted to brushing my teeth with baking soda and rubbing alcohol. are there any dangers to this?

"most helpful answer thanks for giving such great detail in your post. it's very helpful. of course i can't diagnose you by internet (i can't diagnose you at all legally) but here's my take on the situation: although your cpap is humidified the bright red blood you're seeing probably is in fact due to your airway becoming dehydrated from the air flow during sleep. generally speaking bright red blood ""in"" a body substance (mucus stool) isn't really ""in"" the substance -- it's ""on"" it. and when blood is ""on"" another body fluid it means it originated elsewhere such as from torn tissue. i wish i could offer you some advice about how to resolve the situation. you might try lubricating your nasal passages with a small amount of water-based lubricant (like k-y jelly; not petroleum jelly or lotion or anything like that) to see if it helps. a small amount of k-y jelly rubbed just inside the nostrils before bed often solves issues like minor nosebleeds and even tissue dehydration from a cpap. i know you said you're a mouth-breather but you still might give it a whirl. if the situation doesn't clear up within a couple of weeks definitely check with your healthcare provider about it. many people discontinue the use of cpap machines for reasons such as the one you're describing and that's not good. if you have sleep apnea you definitely need to continue using your cpap. while it may be unrealistic to aim for complete comfort with zero side effects from using the cpap your provider may be able to help you find a way to be comfortable while using this life-saving device. wishing you well!"	can a cpap machine cause blood in the sputum? . i started using a machine a week ago. first with pillows which did not work because of my sinuses and now with a full mask. it has humidity in it. i am 57 yrs. old. i have never had blood before when i cough up what drained down during the night. i am coughing very little. the blood is bright red. i am a mouth breather because my sinuses are always clogged up. is that small amount of blood anything to be concerned about?

the common tests used to diagnose thyroid disease include total t4 total t3 free t4 (not bound to protein) and tsh. t4 t3 and free t4 are hormones produced either in the thyroid or converted in the body from thyroid hormones. tsh is produced in the pituitary gland of the brain and is the control center hormone. tsh tells the thyroid how much thyroid hormone should be produced. tsh is the best test to evaluate the overall functioning of the thyroid. so if the tsh value is below normal that means the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone and if the tsh level is above normal there is not enough t4 t3 and free t4. of course if there is disease in the pituitary which is rare then the t4 t3 and free t4 are the informative tests. you should discuss your values with your doctor. as you can see from the values listed below there is a fairly large normal range for t4 and t3. as you mention your values are in the lower range of normal but as long as your tsh is normal your thyroid is working well. remember that you will want to find out the normal range for the laboratory used by your doctor. the values listed below are the usual ranges for most laboratories. the normal range are: tsh (0. 4 - 4. 0 miu/l) total t4 (4. 5 to 11. 2 mcg/dl) total t3 (100 - 200 ng/dl) free t4 (0. 8 - 1. 8 ng/l)	what are the normal thyroid levels for a woman age 54. my dr keeps telling me i'm low-normal.
"i am assuming that you are not using a hormonal form of birth control (e. g. pill/patch/ring/shot). if this is correct then my best guess is as follows. your normal cycle is usually 24 days from the start of one flow to the start of another. this month it sounds like you started the light brown discharge on cycle day19 or so. this might represent premenstrual spotting. this type of spotting can begin as much as a week before flow. some women will get it every month a few days before flow. the usual cause is a missed ovulation or a decline in progesterone level that month. this is not an uncommon or worrisome thing unless it happens every month. of course if you have any risks for pregnancy that should be ruled out. a reliable pregnancy test done on cycle day 28-30 should be done if you are sexually active. if the test is negative and you have no risks for a new chlamydia infection you could choose to self monitor through the next cycle. hopefully your ""normal-for-you"" pattern will reset it self naturally. if erratic bleeding persists see your gyn or local family planning clinic. lastly if you are using hormonal birth control then this would likely represent breakthrough bleeding from the hormones in your birth control method."	my period stopped two weeks ago and i now have a light brown discharge. it's 24 days between periods. what’s happening?

hi i m not a cardiologist or anything but due to my experience with anxiety i can tell you that it had caused my heart to beat so fast that it made my chest hurt and i felt short of breath. to answer your question to the best of my knowledge arteries do not go from normal to clogged in 7 months unless you have risks such as family history of heart disease not being active and eating unhealthy foods (high in salt and fat). i would recommend however to call up your cardiologist and ask for yourself to get checked out again just to be sure.	can your arteries go from normal to clogged in 7 months? i was told i was fine and now i'm scared it has changed. i went to the cardiologist about seven months ago. i had 2 ekgs and an electrocardiogram. everything was normal. i had a very emotionally stressful week and the entire week i've had anxiety issues. during the anxiety i had slight chest pain on my left side. i woke up one morning and i my pectoral muscles were tight and felt like i had a strong workout without working out. during the next 6 days i've had pain and tingling in my arm/under my armpit. is this just a reaction on my anxiety

"i'm happy to help you understand this. bun/creatinine is a combination of laboratory tests that measure your kidney function. bun stands for ""blood urea nitrogen. "" the test looks basically looks at your kidneys' ability to filter the naturally occurring waste product urea from your blood. if you have a high level of urea in your blood then your kidneys may not be working well. the creatinine lab test measures how much creatinine (another naturally occurring waste product) is in your blood. the kidneys should filter creatinine very efficiently so a high creatinine level could mean your kidneys aren't functioning well. the lab result you are asking about bun/creatinine ratio basically tells whether or not your are dehydrated. when a person is severely dehydrated his or her bun level will rise more than the creatinine level. in your case your bun/creatinine ratio is 24. that is barely above the high end of the reference range (normal range). this means you could be mildly dehydrated but basically you seem to be fine. wishing you well!"	can you tell me what this result means? bun/creatinine ratio 24 reference range: 9-23

the best single step you can take is to use a generic substitution for brand-name medicines whenever possible. generics are safe and reliable versions of medicines that are far cheaper than name-brand products. not only are generics less expensive they’re also older medicines with longer track records of safety. if a pharmacist tells you that a prescribed medication has no generic version there may be a medicine that’s similar enough to do the job in generic form. even if there isn’t a generic of any similar medication a different one might be in a lower-tier for your copay. ask the pharmacist to contact your doctor before switching any medicine. samples can save you money in the short run but may cost you later. for long term medicines you may be able to order a larger quantity through a mail-order service. ask your insurance company if you have a mail-order pharmacy benefit. sometimes a larger quantity can be prescribed for the same copay. this won’t work for pills taken every day — the pharmacist won’t give you more than a one month supply — but for prescription skin creams or medicines taken “as needed” your doctor could prescribe a larger amount at once. many drug manufacturers offer “patient assistance programs” to help low-income families afford medications. an excellent non-profit website with clear instructions for finding and using these programs is www. needymeds. org. needymeds also features a free drug discount card for your whole family to use.	how can i save money on prescription medications?
this is a tricky question to answer because every person metabolizes (breaks down and eliminates) medications and other substances at different rates. sex body mass and other factors also can influence how fast a person clears any given substance from the body. for example a person with decreased liver or kidney function may metabolize a substance more slowly than someone else. when it comes to marijuana the amount you smoke may affect how quickly the active ingredient (thc) may be detectable in the blood for longer periods of time among heavier smokers than among occasional smokers. in general blood testing for marijuana (thc) is performed to measure impairment such as in driving while under the influence cases. some experts say marijuana is detectable in the blood for up to a week among regular smokers. despite the legalization of recreational and medical marijuana in some states you should understand the effects of marijuana usage on your body and you should never ever drive after using marijuana. reaction times can be severely impaired after using marijuana which makes driving unsafe for yourself and everyone else on the road. please make smart choices about your health! wishing you well! order 100% legit n safe medical marijuana pain relievers cbd oils dabs and more. for more info text (505) 807-7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com medical marijuana is good for your health top medical strains for all patients suffering from depression glaucoma anxiety and tension headaches chronic pain and nausea mental and physical fatigue and for calming aromatherapy then you are in the right place to look in our meds all top grade aa+ with high level of cbd and thc contact for your supply and good health. pain killers medical marijuana act. lean ***(( no prescribtion is needed))) bud seeds harsh oils dabs & other m. m treatments. we also sefely and securely deliver all sorts of generic medication and syrup nationwide at very good prices. no prescribtions needed. legit verified and reputed plug. available in the u. s canada australia and the uk. for more info text (505) 807-7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com. thank you. sdsd	how long does marijuana stay in your blood?
a three (3) year old child can have high blood pressure. most children have some other underlying medical condition as the cause of their high blood pressure. they can also be subject to being overweight and have other conditions that are found in adults with high blood pressure. a child's blood pressure reading requires a physician to utilize charts to interpret the true meaning of the systolic/diastolic numbers. the charts must compare the subject child exactly in considering age height weight and sex. in order for high blood pressure to be diagnosed in a child their readings must be at least higher than 95% of similar children. of course blood pressure readings can change from minute- to- minute and should be taken during multiple office visits to validate the consistency of high blood pressure readings. without knowing the height weight and sex of the child an exact reading for high blood pressure in a 3 year old cannot be determined with certainty. but according to the national heart lung and blood institute a typical three year old child would be at the 95 percentile for high blood pressure when the consistent readings are at 104/67. their chart should only be used as a rough guide as it considers only age and does not make allowances for height weight and sex. if you suspect that your child may have high blood pressure a visit to their pediatrician is justified.	what is consider high blood pressure for a child age of 3yrs old? or can a 3yrs old have high blood pressure?

"the swelling is caused by too much fluid in the tissue which is called ""edema. "" swollen feet legs and ankles are a very common problem that usually doesn't require treatment. for example gravity often pulls fluid down into the feet when you've been walking all day. this swelling usually goes away by the next day. however edema that doesn't go away should be investigated by your healthcare provider. edema can be caused by: • venous stasis (veins in the lower legs that don't work properly) • being overweight • aging • blood clot in the leg • heart problems (such as heart failure) • injury or infection • excessive salt intake • pregnancy if you have swollen feet legs or ankles occasionally here's what you can do to help the swelling go down: • raise your legs above the level of your heart by lying in bed or on a sofa with several pillows propping up your feet • exercise regularly which keeps your veins working well • reduce your salt consumption • wear support stockings (made for men and women) if you frequently experience swollen feet legs or ankles – or if the swelling is on only one side – see your healthcare provider to rule out other health problems. this is new to me since my potassium last week could this be a side affect?"	what causes swollen feet and ankles?

when your child has a sore throat it’s important to find out if it’s strep throat or not. ever wonder why? strep (officially called group a streptococcus) is a bacterial infection that needs to be treated with antibiotics. and all the other sore throats caused by the virus of the week just need time and tlc to resolve. why does strep need to be treated? while many people clear the throat infection on their own untreated strep can do some pretty serious damage in other body parts. untreated strep can infect the heart brain and joints. that’s called rheumatic fever. and it’s why we need to know if that sore throat is due to strep bacteria. doctors have always known that strep prefers to infect school-aged kids instead of babies toddlers or preschoolers. but a recent study in the journal pediatrics confirmed this. about 37% of school-aged children who see their docs for a sore throat will have a strep infection. but only 24% of children under five years of age have strep when they have a throat infection. bottom line: little kids usually get viral sore throats big kids are more likely to have strep. so how do docs know when it’s strep throat (besides doing a strep test of course). here are 10 things that make me think of strep: 1. 5 years of age or older? 2. sore throat without runny nose or cough? 3. sore throat with headache and/or stomachache? 4. sore throat and fine pinpoint sandpapery/rough feeling rash (called “scarlet fever”)? 5. sore throat and raised dots on the tongue (called “strawberry tongue”)? 6. sore throat and a persistent fever for more than a couple of days? 7. (for girls) sore throat and a really red vaginal area? 8. sore throat and really red skin around his/her anus? 9. strep going around your child’s school childcare or your house (late fall winter spring)? 10. a history of getting strep throat before? if you think your child has strep don’t panic. even if your child has had the illness for a few days antibiotics will do the trick to clear the infection and prevent rheumatic fever. just make an appointment to see your child’s doctor!	how can you tell a child has strep?

calorie needs are individual and depend on age gender lean body mass and your level of activity. since you are not overweight i wonder why you count calories at all. it seems to me if you eat well balanced regular meals and let hunger and fullness guide your eating you will get the right amount for your body type. emerging research shows that young adults who eat this way (often called intuitive or mindful eating) have lower bmis -- and disordered eating -- then those who don't. it may be that you started counting calories to lose weight 5 years ago. but i say ditch the calorie counting and learn how to trust and nourish your body instead. read more. healthy eating: recognize your hunger signals	"i eat 1 200-1 500 calories a day. is that enough? . i'm 19 5""3' female and weigh 120. for the past at least five years of my life i've been eating 1 200-1 500 calories which leaves me feeling satisfied energized and maintaining my weight. i've been eating a very healthy vegan diet and have eaten pretty healthy my whole life. i feel like i'm eating enough and i'm maintaining my weight but our ""experts"" say i need to eat more. i feel like if i ate more i would just gain weight but i'm at a healthy weight now. i exercise moderately."
we know aspirin interferes with blood clotting so people go off aspirin for some period of time. but often patients don’t know that some of the other medications they are taking without a prescription again or even with prescription may interfere. so we have a list of over 200 medications over the counter and prescription that are known to contain elements that would interfere with blood clotting and we give it to the patient well in advance of the surgery and say look through this list and if you’re taking any of these please stop or let’s talk about. and we ask very specifically on our questionnaires what medicines are you taking both prescription medications and non-prescription medications. we are trying to make sure the patient doesn’t forget or doesn’t disregard the importance of these medications that could interfere by the way not only with the bleeding but even with the anesthesia. there are certain drugs that the anesthesiologist would be very unhappy if he didn’t know the patient were taking. but it’s not just supplements and prescriptions. what about foods? well garlic and ginger for example when consumed in large amounts can cause some change in clotting yeah so we tell people about it. we tell people those things that would get them into trouble. by the way foods can also help us though because papaya and pineapple rich in an enzyme called papase which is the same thing that is in meat tenderizer after surgery very good because they help digest the red cells that cause bruising. when you see a bruise it’s because the red cells in the blood have seeped into the tissues and it helps digest them. so you know foods can work for us and they can also work against us. but we need to know. this is the most important thing. and this is why it’s so important to have a very complete evaluation by the cosmetic surgeon a very complete evaluation by your personal doctor so that none of these things would slip through the cracks. we don’t want anything slipping through the cracks. an anesthesiologist’s worst nightmare is that the patient took a drug that the anesthesiologist didn’t know about and that drug was in the patient’s system and could interfere sometimes significantly with a safe anesthetic.	what medications and foods should i avoid before surgery?

it is recommended to avoid alcohol when taking lyrica. the problem is that alcohol may increase the sedative effects of alcohol. in other words make you sleepy. lyrica may also increase the effects that alcohol has on your body so that even a small amount of alcohol may feel like you had a lot more to drink. it is tough to predict the effects in any given person so that's why we recommend avoiding alcohol when taking this medication. i would not skip a dose without talking to your doctor.	can you drink alcohol while on lyrica? should you just not have your dose for that day?

hi if its a vaginal hysterectomy this is an operation to remove a woman's uterus (womb) and cervix. the operation is carried out through the vagina - no cut is made on the abdomen. the top of the vagina is closed. rarely the ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed at the same time – this operation is called a salpingo-oophorectomy. the only thing i can find about being overweight is this. women who are overweight for example take longer to recover. when discussing the pros and cons of hysterectomy with your gynaecologist you should take into account possible problems including side effects and complications. do hope this helps you. good luck	is an overweight woman good candidate for partial hysterectomy. bleeding has been going on and off for years and i just had an endomertrial biopsy but don't know the results but i have been told that a hysterectomy partial would be good for me but then someone else said no i do not want to keep livening with this bleeding issue please help me

when someone has adhd it can take several weeks and sometimes even months for a physician to determine the correct type (class) of medication dose and treatment schedule to effectively reduce that patient’s adhd symptoms while at the same time limiting potential side effects. if you can’t get your medication there are several things you can do to try to get by until your medication is available again. substituting like-for-like is the best alternative. if a generic version of your medication is available try that first (example: methylphenidate for ritalin). talk to your physician about trying the short-acting version of the same medication you are on but take it more frequently. let people know that you are not able to take your medication and ask for their help and understanding. (parents be sure to send a note to school to inform your child’s teacher and ask for help). give yourself more time to accomplish a task. this might mean getting up earlier in the morning or asking for an extension on an assignment. if you tend to act impulsively put off making an important decision until you are back on your medication or at the very least sleep on it overnight. use tools to keep on task. set an alarm and check that you are doing what you are suppose to be doing. ask for more supervision or have someone check in with you more frequently. do the hardest tasks first or earlier in the morning when you are not as tired. get plenty of rest and exercise. exercise can decrease hyperactivity and that feeling of restlessness. take frequent breaks. get up and walk around and come back to a task after a few minutes to refocus. try to keep to the same routine. make lists and use lots of reminders. send yourself an email or voice mail or write on your hand if you need to. if driving is a problem ask someone else for a ride or take public transportation. forgive yourself and ask others to be more patient with you. don’t make excuses but do make a sincere effort to avoid problem situations or discussions that you know may get out of hand. don’t forget to eat. start your medication again as soon as it is available. plan ahead and keep a few pills in reserve for the next time that there is a shortage!	what can i do if my adhd medication is unavailable for refill?
hi your find that doctors say it's your body flushing out everything your body retained while pregnant. he said when blood stays inside and just sits with your body's natural bacteria (good and bad) it causes at foul odour. and it'll go away once your body flushes everything out. you may still have at your 6wk pp check up. this could be for both of your problems. been on any antibiotics lately this could be another reason to your problem as well. but to help cure your odour you could try having sea salt baths twice a day its just a couple of handfuls in a shallow bath but let this water get inside your vagina you could find it helps you. do hope this helps you. good luck	experiencing cloudy foul smelling urine along with foul yellow mucus like discharge. no burning itching or inflammation. had c-section one month ago and am now experiencing cloudy foul smelling urine along with foul yellowish mucus like discharge. i am not experiencing any itching burning inflammation or painful intercourse. could this be a simple uti or vaginal infection from child birth?

the surgical treatment for prostate cancer is commonly referred to as a radical or total prostatectomy which is the removal of the entire prostate gland. since 1990 the radical prostatectomy has been the most common treatment for prostate cancer in the u. s. this operation is done in about 36% of patients with organ-confined (localized) prostate cancer. the american cancer society estimates a 90% cure rate nationwide when the disease is confined to the prostate and the entire gland is removed. the potential complications of a radical prostatectomy include the risks of anesthesia local bleeding impotence (loss of sexual function) in 30%-70% of patients and incontinence (loss of control of urination) in 3%-10% of patients. great strides have been made in lowering the frequency of the complications of radical prostatectomy. these advances have been accomplished largely through improved anesthesia and surgical techniques. the improved surgical techniques in turn stem from a better understanding of the key anatomy and physiology of sexual potency and urinary continence. specifically the recent introduction of nerve-sparing techniques for the prostatectomy has helped to reduce the frequency of impotence and incontinence. if post-treatment impotence does occur it can be treated by sildenafil (viagra) tablets injections of such medications as alprostadil (caverject) into the penis various devices to pump up or stiffen the penis or a penile prosthesis (an artificial penis). incontinence after treatment often improves with time special exercises and medications to improve the control of urination. occasionally however incontinence requires implanting an artificial sphincter around the urethra. the artificial sphincter is made up of muscle or other material and is designed to control the flow of urine through the urethra.	what is the surgical treatment for prostate cancer?

there are techniques for penile enlargement surgery what that involves you really don’t enlarge the penis but what you really do is change perception. there is a ligament that holds the penis up and when you cut it drops down and it can actually increase in length a quarter of an inch or half an inch not enough to even be significant. but there’s risks with that. then there’s techniques where they can inject fat along the penis to try to make it look bigger. but even if you look at interviews with hundreds of men who have these penile enlargement procedures almost all of them are disasters they’re unhappy they don’t like how it turned out and time and again the interviews almost always ended with the man saying “i wish i never did this ” avoid it at all costs it’s not what you think. complications are horrible imagine if you get an infection down there -- the scarring the misery chronic pain curvature that can’t be corrected. most men that opt for penile enlargement surgery using current technologies are very very unhappy. it’s really not a wise thing to do.	do penile enlargement surgeries work?
most helpful answer not having a fallopian tube can indeed decrease your chances of getting pregnant. assuming your right ovary is still working the lack of a fallopian tube on that side means any egg put out by the ovary has nowhere to go. that means you can only get pregnant when your left ovary is putting out an egg. obviously you can't control which ovary puts out an egg in any given month. your best bet is to consult your gynecologist for specific information about your case. he or she may be able to refer you to an infertility specialist for some kind of treatment. i wish you all the best!	i'm trying to get pregnant from last 3 months. i dont have right felopian tube does it affect to get pregnant? wt do i do?

relationship issues need to be settled down before it starts disturbing you. you have to fully understand what will it lead to and how will it affect your life in long run. when you get into any relationship for more than a year you start associating and sharing your feelings with that person which is quite obvious. in any breakup the reason for breakup is very important to deal with. you have not mentioned it here. if you had mentioned it would have been even more helpful in suggestions. suggestions: it seems that you have not yet accepted that you had a breakup. the reason for it must be challenged and accepted on your part. once you deal with that it will be easier for you to move on. try journaling or writing to an unknown friend (or to yourself) and share your emotions and feelings honestly. do not avoid recalling your memories because the more you avoid the more you get into it. go through it with the help of a counsellor and it will make you feel much better. follow up with the details of your relationship issue for the better management. consult a psychiatrist online --> <link>	Hi,One year ago I had a serious breakup with my girlfriend.

getting your blood sugar under control quickly is very important. the damage to your body starts well before your blood sugars are in the diabetic range. that's why once we know you have diabetes (or even prediabetes) it's very important to act quickly to get things under control. even once you start medicine it's also very important to continue to work on your weight and exercise. it's wonderful that you're focused on that! once you start medicine it doesn't mean you have to be on it forever. most people with diabetes can actually go off medicine if they get their weight down enough and make the right lifestyle changes. i would encourage you to discuss this issue further with your doctor as only he knows your health as well as you do. but it is important to get your blood sugar under control as quickly as possible and your best bet is probably to take the medicine as your doctor suggests remembering it can be just temporary.	my dr told me i was in diabetic range he perscribed me some medicaion and i refuse to take it. . i want to know what are the risks of not taking medicine when i am looseing weight and on a regular exercise plan.

you seem to have a smart pa. general anesthesia is very shocking to the body. here are the suspected reason for hair loss after receiving general anesthesia: hair growth is dependent on cell division which is interfered with while under general anesthesia. without the necessary and required frequent cell division hair follicles lack the nutrients necessary for production; additionally while under anesthesia for longer periods of time the patient's head may be in a fixed position causing pressure and reducing blood supply to hair follicles; thirdly blood loss during surgery causes the body to divert blood to vital organs while reducing it to more non-essential areas such as hair follicles; the good news is that normal hair growth should be restored within 3 months of surgery.	does anesthesia cause hair loss? . i had cervical spine surgery from the back. and after surgery my hair started to fall out. not clumps but all over. mt pa said it could be from he anesthesia. if so how long does this last? . thanks

"hepatitis means ""inflamed liver. "" as you probably know there are many different things that can cause the liver to become inflamed. we use the letters a b c and so on to denote several known bacterial and virus infections that cause hepatitis. hepatitis c is caused by a virus and cannot be cured. therefore it's important to know how you can get hep-c. you get hepatitis c through direct contact with infected blood. the typical ways this happens is: sharing needles used to inject illicit drugs getting a tattoo with a needle contaminated with hep-c getting a piercing using equipment contaminated with hep-c having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant prior to 1992 receiving an injection with a needle that was previously used to inject someone with hep-c you get the idea. hepatitis c is of particular concern to baby boomers because they may have become infected back in the summer of love (late 1960s) and not even know it. that's why the centers for disease control recommend all people born between 1946 and 1964 get tested for hep-c. hepatitis c can live in your body for years without causing symptoms. if you think you may have been exposed to hepatitis c you should see a health care provider. a simple blood test can tell you if you have the virus or not. wishing you well!"	hepititis c how do you get it?
no. that’s not right. the provision of the health reform law that allows adult children to stay on their parents’ health plan applies to all insurers. the right to keep your adult child on your insurance plan until age 26 is a federal law that went into effect last year as a result of health reform. though there will be aspects of the new law with which self-funded plans will not be required to comply this provision is not one of them. by law you are allowed to keep your adult child on your health plan. other provisions with which self-funded plans will need to comply include preventive services with no cost sharing and no lifetime or annual limits on coverage. if you are a young person looking for health insurance or a parent looking on behalf of your child check out this previous post about finding health insurance for young adults. and for more information about extending insurance to young adults here’s a helpful question/answer write-up by the u. s. department of health and human services.	my company said our plan is self-funded and kids can't stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26. are they right?

this morning it was cold foggy and drizzling. i lit a fire while i was making breakfast for my daughter. we talked about how it was the perfect stay-home-and-have-hot-chocolate-watch-a-movie day. my restaurant is closed on sunday. so the driving force of my day is to clear my mind free of business stress and enjoy the comforts of home. while zoning out a bit on a reality show about bridal dresses i let my mind wander to what i should make for dinner tonight. i like to keep our sunday dinners easy to prepare comforting healthy and delicious. on the menu for tonight will be a version of my tuscan chicken soup from mom-a-licious. i love this soup because it is so satisfying can be prepared in under 30 minutes and provides leftovers that will last through the week. i am going to take on the more lengthy preparation because i have the extra time today. i will cook a whole natural chicken to make the broth and the meat for the soup. the smell that fills the house as the stock simmers through the afternoon is pure heaven and aromatherapy that brings about memories of childhood and my grandmother. i boil an entire chicken in a large pot without cutting or quartering the chicken. i cover the chicken with two inches of water. i bring it to a boil and then turn down to a simmer. i cook mine with cut up onion carrot and whole pieces of garlic for extra flavor. i leave it simmering for 1-2 hours depending on the weight of chicken. when the chicken is done you can pour all the broth through a strainer. let the chicken cool for a few minutes. if you prefer put on kitchen gloves and pull the meat off the bones (it comes off very easily) and discard the skin and bones of the chicken. after the broth is done i will add the pulled chicken rinsed canned italian white beans and kidney beans (you can add any type you like) and a can of crushed organic tomatoes. fresh basil and dill will be added. i’ll stir in finely chopped carrot and celery toward the end (so it retains a bit of a crunch). then i’ll serve it with freshly grated parmesan cheese and warm bread. i’m going to go curl up on the couch with a good book and my daughter wait for the approaching dinner hour and smell the delicious aromas that promise a hearty healthy dinner.	how can i make an easy chicken soup?

both carbamazepine and flunarizine have side effect of memory loss. you should take tablet vasograin. it is most effective at the onset of migraine. once migraine starts though it reduces some symptoms but not so effectively. so along with it take tablet diclomol (combination of diclofenac and paracetamol) twice a day for three days. it is very effective to control migraine. if headache is very severe you can also take injection voveran intramuscularly. you also need to take tablet razo (rabeprazole) 20 mg twice a day to prevent acidity. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am 26 years old. I am suffering from migraine for the last 15 years. There is a throbbing pain on one corner of the head and generally the next day it almost definitely shifts to the other corner. This cycle continues. So, the frequency is around 2 headaches per week. I used to take Paracetamol  and Aspirin though the medicines were not very effective. If the medicines are taken within the first half an hour of the beginning of pain, it gives reasonably good results. Two years back, my family doctor prescribed Sibelium 10 mg to be taken once every night. It gave me good results for a while but it increased my hours of sleep and resulted in weight gain and then the migraine attacks also started. My doctor prescribed Zen 200 mg to be taken every morning over and above Sibelium 10 mg in the night. This gave me very good results. Migraine attacks almost stopped. I stopped taking Sibelium and Zen 200 mg was enough to control migraine unless I am travelling by car for over 3 hours. My doctor told that the clinical dose of Carbamazepine is 1600 mg per day and 200 mg is negligible. I gradually reduced the dose to 100 mg per day and then 100 mg twice or thrice a week. Later, though Carbamazepine is not considered as a pain abortive medicine, it worked for me. I used to take 100 mg tablet whenever required. For the last 6 months, I am feeling that I am suffering from memory loss. I used to have a very sharp memory. But, nowadays I forget names. Though, I do not forget events that much but my memory power of remembering names has become miserable. I even forget the name of a person I meet a week or a month ago. I have stopped taking Carbamazepine since June and I am taking Sibelium 10 mg whenever required, approximately twice a week, with good results. But, my memory especially in remembering names has become dull. Please advice.
fever in a child (not sure what age) does not cause stunted growth so i am unclear as to the medical justification of the x-ray unless the doctor wanted to get a chest x-ray to rule out a subtle pneumonia. tylenol can be given every 4 hours but ibuprofen is every six hours. fevers are not harmful. they are the body's normal response to fighting off infections (usually viruses) so if a child is over 3 months old medical provider rarely get excited about routine fevers.	can a fever in an infant cause stunted growth? . my month old daughter had a fever of 102. 5 for a week straight. we called our pediatrician everyday and they just advised us to give her motrin/tyleon every 4 hours until it broke. they now are wanting to do x-rays of her to confirm that her growth has not been stunted. i just am not sure why i need to expose her to the radiation when we are able to measure her and compare her numbers to the growth charts.
this is gingivitis that develops during pregnancy. the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy -- especially the increased level of progesterone -- may make it easier for certain gingivitis-causing bacteria to grow as well as make gum tissue more sensitive to plaque and exaggerate the body's response to the toxins (poisons) that result from plaque.	what is pregnancy gingivitis?
as you lose weight your caloric intake will decrease. meaning your body will need less calories to function as you lose weight. you could not be eating enough calories as well. if we do not eat enough calories to function our bodies will move into a starvation mode and we will conserve the calories stored and this will prevent weight loss. the bmi calculator tool (found here ) is very useful in deciding how many calories to eat a day. when you exercise you might require a few extra calories. so yes eating more might help with your weight loss.	i have negative calories every day like 1k. is that why i am not losing weight? . i am using the food/fitness counter. i eat about 5 times a day but end up with a negative 1000 calories a day because of my exercise and activities? is this why i am not losing weight? how do i overcome that? it would seem weird to eat more an additional 1000 calories a day to actually lose weight. according to the tool on webmd that is what i should do. thank you for your help.

over the years high blood sugar slowly causes damage to blood vessels throughout the body. this is especially true in the heart and brain. as a result heart disease and stroke are two of the most important health risks for people with diabetes. if you or someone you love has diabetes here are some of the statistics you need to know about heart disease and diabetes: heart disease strikes people with diabetes almost twice as often as people who don't have diabetes. people with diabetes tend to develop heart disease at a younger age than people without diabetes. two out of three people with diabetes die from either heart disease or stroke. compared to people without diabetes people with diabetes are at about two to four times the risk for stroke. stroke is a serious health risk for people with diabetes. but it affects fewer people overall than heart disease.	does having diabetes increase the risk of heart disease?

your husband is probably suffering from postherpethic neuralgia as a result of the herpes zosters virus. pain management is often mediated with painkillers specifically designed to deal with nerve pain. antidepressants such as amitriptyline or anticonsulvants are effective in this area. although paracetamol and nsaid's do work to. if all else fails mild opiates or opiate likes.	what medication is best for shingle pain after rash is gone its been going on for three months. has tried lyrica for short time and on tegretol now but not working which is best for the pain. my husband is 72 and also has leukemia

unfortunately i do not know the medical details of this gunshot wound to comment specifically. some wounds are sutured and some are not. if the clinician knows that there are absolutely no foreign materials (pieces of cloth dirt bullet fragments etc. then it may be closed. if a wound is sutured with even the tiniest piece of foreign material it is highly likely to get infected so many surgeons will leave it open to drain. if a sutured wound becomes infected it may need to be opened. if the wound is in an area that is cosmetic (face neck etc. ) then it should be closed. antibiotics are often appropriate since wound infections will complicate healing. i am not sure what type of specialist that is being seen now but since they have the ability to examine the person they are the ones who can best comment on the quality of care.	why would a gunshot wound in the arm not be stitched or sutured? . we took my son to the specialist 48 hours after the gunshot was treated in the er at a hospital. the specialists office was shocked that they left both of the wounds unstitched or sutured. he bled badly when the bandage was removed at the doctor. there was no evidence of iodine/beta dine on the wounds either. is this common because all our sources say it was not proper procedure. please advise us. he now has to be kept on antibiotics for an extended period of time. too late to stitch now!

"the answer to your question is a bit more complex than it might seem. the first question is: how did you take your daughter's temperature? is it an oral temperature? armpit? ear? forehead? each of these methods produces a different ""normal"" temperature range. for example we expect to see a temperature around 98. 6 with an oral reading but an armpit temp will be lower than that. a rectal or ear (tympanic) temperature may be higher than 98. 6. secondly if you took your daughter's temperature orally did you do so shortly after she'd had something cool or cold to drink? if so this can lower the thermometer reading significantly. an oral reading should be taken at least 20 minutes after eating or drinking anything. try taking a second reading to see if the number changes. if you're taking an oral reading be sure to do it properly. have your daughter lift her tongue then place the tip of the thermometer well under your daughter's tongue up against the midline ""frenulum"" (the tissue that divides the underside of the tongue). have your daughter gently close her mouth while you hold onto the thermometer in order to keep the probe well-seated under the tongue. the thermometer should stay at about a 45-degree angle. third are you sure the thermometer is accurate? cleanse the thermometer and take someone else's temperature. do you get a relatively accurate reading? if your daughter's oral or rectal temperature really is 95. 2 and she has other symptoms such as: sluggishness paleness difficulty speaking or responding to your questions mental confusion. then you should seek immediate medical attention. it's not common but certain types of serious illnesses or infections can cause a drop in body temperature. and since your daughter is just 5 years old you don't want to take any chances. i hope this helps!"	my 5 year old daughter has been sick and now she has a temperature of 95. 2. is this too low? should we be concerned? . please help any way you can. thank you in advance.

so sorry to hear you're going through this. i can think of few things worse than a sinus headache! your best bet is to make another trip to the doctor for a re-evaluation of your symptoms. it sounds like you're doing everything right in terms of taking your prescribed medications checking your shower for mold and mildew etc. since your symptoms have continued after finishing the antibiotics you were prescribed you'd be well-advised to go back for further evaluation. your health care provider may want to try a different type of medication to help manage your symptoms. in the meantime you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers as directed on the bottle. this may help some with the pain. good luck to you. feel better soon!	after getting sick (step i believe) a sinus issue developed. has persisted and i'm having pressure headaches now. i took amoxicillin when i got sick. sinus issue persisted and developed into pressure headaches between the eyes. i went back to the doctor and was prescribed clarithromycin. it seemed to help a bit but after finishing my prescription i'm still having pressure headaches. the drainage is going into my throat and is mostly clear/white sometimes yellowish. changed the shower head and continually spray my shower with anti-mold (though dark mildew keeps seeping through caucing). what can i do?
did you know that nearly half of all children have tooth decay by the time they reach kindergarten? to prevent early tooth decay get into the habit of wiping your baby's teeth and gums every night before bed. limit your baby's intake of juices and sweetened foods and drinks. finally one main cause of cavities is the transfer of decay-causing bacteria from a parent's mouth (usually the mother's) to the baby's mouth so avoid putting things like pacifiers into your own mouth before putting it into baby's mouth.	how can i help prevent tooth decay while my child is a baby?
hi here’s a list that may help you. many arrhythmias occur as a complication of a heart condition. for example ischaemic heart disease (which causes angina and heart attacks). this reduces the blood supply to parts of the heart which may include parts of the conducting system. a damaged section of heart muscle (following a heart attack) can trigger an arrhythmia or block electrical impulses. heart valve diseases can cause the heart muscle to enlarge which can trigger abnormal electrical activity. for example af is a common complication of mitral valve disease. high blood pressure can put strain on the heart and cause arrhythmias. age-related degeneration (ageing) around the conducting fibres is one cause of complete heart block. cardiomyopathy (a disorder of the heart muscle) can sometimes cause arrhythmias. some arrhythmias are due to abnormalities in the electrical pathways which are present from birth. one example is an extra electrical pathway which sometimes develops between the atria and ventricles. this can cause a type of svt. (however symptoms may not first start until you are a young adult. ) some congenital heart defects are associated with certain arrhythmias. inflammation of the heart and other less common heart disorders are other possible causes. your should find out that sex is not the bad fro what your asking a good orgasm does release some good things around our body’s as for exercise as long as its not to herd or fast you should be ok swimming would be good for you its gentle and less stressful and also low impact. hope this helps you. good luck	can arrhythmia be caused by extreme exercise or sexual activity?

based on your income and family size you should qualify for a substantial subsidy with monthly payments well below $1 000 per month. in fact your plan shouldn't cost more than a few thousand per year. as you likely know there have been many different problems with the functionality of healthcare. gov and one of them is the accuracy with which it determines subsidy eligibility. i suggest you pick up the phone to speak with someone directly at healthcare. gov to get personalized assistance walking through the process. you might also try working with an insurance agent certified to sell through healthcare. gov. you can find one at nahu. org by searching for an agent in your state.	i'm self-employed with a family of 5. my projected income for 2014 is no more than $50 000. yet the aca site offers me insurance plans with monthly premiums of $1 000 or more. shouldn't i qualify for a hefty subsidy?
age spots are sun spots (brown spots) that come from sun damage. many people don't realize that sun damage comes out years after the sun exposure. so they don't bother to wear sunscreen on a regular basis. it's important to wear a broad spectrum sunscreen everyday as sun damage is cumulative and 10 minutes everyday adds up.	what are age spots?
the medication has fda approval however if the fda didn't approve it for the exact reason you're using it your plan may deny coverage. there could be other reasons they won't cover it. maybe you need prior authorization or there are limits to the amount you can buy or the particular brand your doctor prescribes isn't covered. insurance policies impose a wide range of rules we must follow to have our care or prescription drugs covered. i would go further with your health plan and push to speak with someone who can give you a clear understanding of why you suddenly can't get the patches so you have a better idea of how to proceed.	is lidocaine patch approved by fda for sugical nerve trauma. surgical trauma of nerve tissue treated by lidocaine patch approved by fda? i have been using them for at least 3 years and they work for me. however now medicare part d is saying they are not fda approved for this condition. i have other articles saying differently. please explain.

although it is hard to say if you have the flu or not if you are still feeling ill please call you healthcare provider and ask their advice about treatment for your illness if you get the flu pumping your breast milk and having a healthy adult give your baby the breast milk is a good way to protect your baby. the flu virus is not transmitted through breast milk. maternal antibodies are transmitted through breast milk which may actually help protect the child if s/he was already exposed to influenza. it is ok to take antivirals to treat the flu while you are breastfeeding. if there is no one else who can take care of your baby while you are sick try to wear a face mask at all times when you are feeding or caring for your baby. you should also be very careful about washing your hands and taking everyday precautions to prevent your baby from getting flu. using a cloth blanket between you and your baby during feedings might also help. if you think your baby has developed flu-like symptoms please call your healthcare provider quickly so your baby may be examined.	is the flu virus transferable through breast milk? . i think i have the flu or a virus of some kind was violently ill yesterday morning; vomiting fever chills body aches and joint pains stomach cramps headache fatigue. i still don't feel well nothing like yesterday though. i just wanted to know if my 9 month old whom i am still nursing will catch the same virus and have the same symptoms through my breast milk?
"well it's hard to say. a number of conditions could be causing the pain you describe. unless you're running a fever you probably can safely take a ""watchful waiting"" approach to see if the situation improves. if you begin to run a fever you definitely should seek medical attention. lower-right quadrant pain frequently is associated with appendicitis. by the way appendicitis is considered a medical emergency so if you spike a fever and the pain gets worse you've won a ticket to the er. however many other non-emergency things could cause the pain you're describing. for example a piece of hard stool could be stuck in the intestine temporarily. this is a frequent cause of abdominal pain of all kinds. in this case the stool eventually moves on and the pain goes away. even a pocket of intestinal gas could cause the symptoms you describe. as always my usual advice in any medical situation is this: if things start moving toward ""worse"" instead of ""better "" see your health care provider. meanwhile get a thermometer (don't rely on whether or not you feel hot to the touch or anything of that sort) monitor your temperature (every four hours is fine) and just keep close tabs on the situation. chances are it will clear up on its own. wishing you well!"	i am having right lower abdominal pain that increases with standing and taking deep breaths in. what might this be?

an allergy to your own urine is not possible. your labial itching may eventually help you overcome your fear of being examined since this may be the only way you can have this problem properly diagnosed. this is not something that can be done blindly over the internet based solely on a vague description. having a sympathetic female physician pa or nurse practitioner should ease your discomfort and fear especially if you disclose it prior to your visit. have a trusted friend go with you. your doctor can even provide you with a short-acting anti-anxiety medication to help you overcome your fear. in most cases a yeast infection is the underlying cause but since the labia is covered in skin and skin can have hundreds of dermatological conditions that cause itching it would likely be futile to try and treat a condition that is not even diagnosed.	my labia itch intensely especially after i urinate. no other symptoms. is it possible to be allergic to my urine? . i took a home test for a uti - negative. i took a 3 day course of monistat thinking it might be a yeast infection but that made no difference. i am 56 and celibate for several years but this itch has been going on for about 2 months. vagisil soothes the itch nicely but don't want to live on vagisil. obvious answer is to go to a doctor. problem is i have profound latrophobia - fear of doctors. an exam is out! i have allergies to everything so i tried new tp and detergent. no help. any ideas?

i would be reluctant to use medical marijuana on an elderly person who may have problems with memory and mental processing as it is. however a pain managment specialist may have different ideas. this 95 year old should really see a pain specialist so that his/her pain can be pharmaceutically managed taking into account all of there medical history. personally i have never prescribed it for these reasons. as a former pain pill addict and current medicinal user of cannabis i must respectfully disagree with the doctor. new research is showing that marijuana does not effect the memory in the ways previously thought. however i will admit the effects of marijuana on an elderly patient especially one that has never used it before may be a bit overwhelming. are you in a state where it is legal medicinally because it would be best to do under the care of a doctor considering the age factor. marijuana is a much safer form of pain control than traditional narcotics. it is also being shown to have benefits on numerous other conditions. you can always do the research if you have any doubts or concerns. also to answer your original question marijuana does not come in pill form there is a synthetic pill called marinol but it is not exactly the same as cannabis and is usually only prescribed for cancer patients. there is a variety of ways to reap the benefits of marijuana. i would suggest cannabis oil. a little bit placed under the tongue can go along way. there is also edibles such as cookies cakes and brownies but those tend to have a more psychoactive effect and may be a bit too overwhelming. smoking it is an option but with the patients age i would advice against this. if you are in a state where it is legalized for medicinal use talk with a doctor about your options. if unfortunately your in a state like me where its not you can always find all the information you could ever want or need online. just be careful and make sure you check the sources of the information your reading. also be careful of the law as i can personally attest to even if your just trying to use a safe alternate to treat your pain they will still treat you like a criminal. order 100% legit n safe medical marijuana pain relievers cbd oils dabs and more. for more info text (505) 807-7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com medical marijuana is good for your health top medical strains for all patients suffering from depression glaucoma anxiety and tension headaches chronic pain and nausea mental and physical fatigue and for calming aromatherapy then you are in the right place to look in our meds all top grade aa+ with high level of cbd and thc contact for your supply and good health. pain killers medical marijuana act. lean ***(( no prescribtion is needed))) bud seeds harsh oils dabs & other m. m treatments. we also sefely and securely deliver all sorts of generic medication and syrup nationwide at very good prices. no prescribtions needed. legit verified and reputed plug. available in the u. s canada australia and the uk. for more info text (505) 807-7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com. thank you.	does a person get a high from capsule medical marijuana? does it dull pain or just make the pain tolerable? . could this help a 95 year old who is in severe pain from spinal stenosis and arthritis? does it really have any long term effects on memory?

cerebral palsy can be so variable that without knowing the details of his particular cp involvement it would not be possible for me to offer you a specific answer but generally a teenager with cp can play sports. i admire you for being concerned and cooperative. it was be best for his medical provider to sign a medical clearance -- someone who knows his case. many kids with cp perhaps because of the muscle involvement with this disorder may become more fatigued. if he has some underlying respiratory or cardiac problem then this will need to be evaluated by his medical provider before clearing him for sports participation. kids with cp should be supported and encourage to do many activities so if he can make the team i don't think you will need to worry about his safety any more than the other kids.	is it safe to allow a tennager who has cerebral palsy to play basketball? . i coach a basketball team for high school aged kids and one of my players has cerebral palsy. he played on the team last year but we were very concerned about his condition and his safety but his parents seemed to have no problem with him playing. my coaching staff and i were very concerned about how safe it would be to allow him to play again this year as last yer he could not stay on the court very long without looking very exhausted. is it safe to continue to let him play?

this is a really good question and actually they can take methylprednisolone on an empty stomach or while they are fasting. it's okay. sometimes we recommend it to be taken with food because people complain of abdominal pain or an upset stomach with it. and it is okay to take with the other two medications if they are using to help with their breathing as it might work with copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. if you ever have any questions like this though whether or not you can take something with or without food or other opportunities where you may not be sure about it come and talk to the pharmacist. ask us we'll be more than happy to help you. we are the medication experts.	is it safe to fast while taking methylprednisolone? i also take advair and spiriva.

"osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become fragile and break easily. when someone has osteoporosis it means his/her ""bank account"" of bone tissue has dropped to a low level. if there is significant bone loss even sneezing or bending over to tie a shoe can cause a bone in the spine to break. hips ribs and wrist bones also break easily. the fractures from osteoporosis can be painful and disfiguring. there is no cure for the disease. osteoporosis is most common in older people but can also occur in young and middle-aged adults. optimizing peak bone mass and developing lifelong healthy bone behaviors during youth are important ways to help prevent or minimize osteoporosis risk as an adult. factors affecting peak bone mass peak bone mass is influenced by a variety of factors: some that you can't change such as gender and race and some that you can like nutrition and physical activity. gender: bone mass or density is generally higher in men than in women. before puberty boys and girls develop bone mass at similar rates. after puberty however boys tend to acquire greater bone mass than girls. race: for reasons still not well understood african-american girls tend to achieve higher peak bone mass than caucasian girls and african-american women are at lower risk for osteoporosis later in life. more research is needed to understand the differences in bone density between the various racial and ethnic groups. however because all women regardless of race are at significant risk for osteoporosis girls of all races need to build as much bone as possible to protect them against this disease. hormonal factors: sex hormones including estrogen and testosterone are essential for the development of bone mass. girls who start to menstruate at an early age typically have greater bone density. those who frequently miss their menstrual periods sometimes have lower bone density. nutritional status: calcium is an essential nutrient for bone health. in fact calcium deficiencies in young people can account for a 5% to 10% lower peak bone mass and may increase the risk for bone fracture in later life. a well-balanced diet including adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals such as magnesium zinc and vitamin d is also important for bone health. physical activity: physical activity is important for building healthy bones and provides benefits that are most pronounced in the areas of the skeleton that bear the most weight. these areas include the hips during walking and running and the arms during gymnastics and weight lifting."	what is osteoporosis and how does it affect children?

diarrhea is troubling in 10% of people who have their gallbladders removed. the diarrhea is believed to be due to the fact that following removal of the gallbladder the intestines contain more bile acids than under normal conditions in which bile acids are stored for much of the day in the gallbladder. bile acids cause diarrhea by promoting the secretion of fluid by the intestines and perhaps by stimulating the intestinal muscles to contract. there are no good studies of treatment of this type of diarrhea but two treatments have been proposed and appear to be effective. the first are medications (for example cholestyramine) that attach to bile acids in the intestine and prevent them from interacting with the intestine. the second are fatty acid medications (for example oleic acid) that may act by slowing down the intestinal muscle and perhaps by reducing secretion of fluid although the exact mechanism of action of oleic acid in these patients has not been studied. it is also important remember that there are many other causes of chronic severe diarrhea such as celiac sprue ulcerative colitis crohn's disease microscopic colitis and many more. it is important to work with you doctor to arrive at a firm diagnosis for best treatment results.	is there any treatment for chronic severe diarrhea after gall bladder removal?

i cannot find any evidence showing that rapid weight loss causes blood pressure to rise. in general weight loss typically helps to reduce blood pressure. it's important to remember that other factors can affect blood pressure such as genetics age stress and certain medical conditions. i suggest making an appointment with your healthcare provider to help you figure it out. its unlikely that dehydration or not cooling down could be the cause. here's an article with more common causes of high blood pressure (hypertension).	"can rapid weight loss actually be causing me to have higher blood pressure? . my bicycle is my main transportation. i live in az and i ride an avg of 8 miles a day and have lost over 50 lbs in the last 10 wks. i have been overweight all my life and always had high blood pressure. my blood pressure has been lower than it has been in over 20 yrs until about 2-3 wks ago. it is trending back up with no dietary change or decrease in exercise. can dehydration or not enough ""cool down"" time from physical activity be to blame?"

the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis can be similar to rheumatoid arthritis with morning pain and stiffness along with fatigue. you may have pain and stiffness in the hands wrists elbows shoulders knees ankles feet and spine. arthritis that affects many joints symmetrically is common with psoriatic arthritis. this symmetrical pattern is almost the same as rheumatoid arthritis. yet sometimes psoriatic arthritis joints are less tender than rheumatoid arthritis joints so you may have joint deformity with psoriatic arthritis without significant pain. with psoriasis you may have thick inflamed red skin patches (called plaques) covered with white or silvery scales usually on the elbows knees or other areas. in addition more than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have nail involvement with pitted discolored or thickened nails. psoriatic arthritis can cause a sausage-like swelling of fingers and toes which usually occurs when the fingernails are pitted or discolored. in some people with psoriatic arthritis only one joint is affected yet not the other (one knee only for example). sometimes the spine is affected or just the fingers and toes. about 1/3 of patients with psoriatic arthritis have eye problems such as conjunctivitis or pink eye.	what are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?
"i am an avid biker and there are many solutions that translate from actual road biking to stationary biking: first start off by wearing proper clothing yes a good pair or two of biking shorts (with padding) are just as beneficial on a stationary bike as well as the ones that move. also make sure that you clean your shorts after each ride since residual bacteria can cause irritation. yes biking shorts are expensive but a couple of good pair makes a huge difference. make sure you have a good fitting seat. now if you are a health club you cannot change it but if this a home stationary bike you can change the seat. not all seats are made the same and since a seat might be large and comfy it does not always translate into being good for reducing chaffing. as far as creams or ointments this is where you may have to experiment. using petroleum jelly is fine but i would add some shea butter to the mix. some people use k-y jelly instead and of course there are tons of commercial products like ""brave soldier"" which i have used. changing riding positions also helps simple changing your lateral position on the seat every now and then you can reduce continuos contact on the seat. i hope this helps and keep it up!"	i exercise with a stationary bicycle. i have been chaffed in the groin area. how do i protect my groin from this?
from the description provided it seems that you may be having a condition called as glue ear or serous otitis media. serous otitis media describes a collection of fluid in the middle ear. this may be acute (not lasting for a long time) or chronic (lasting for a long time). chronic (long standing) otitis media as in your case can occur due to long standing eustachian tube blockage or thickening of fluid due to which it cannot be absorbed or drained down the tube. symptoms can range from ear discomfort pain slight reduction in hearing and irritation. treatment of the condition can be done with medications including antihistamines and decongestants and nasal sprays. in long standing cases a small surgical procedure involving placement of a ear tube in the ear drum (tympanic membrane) may be required to facilitate drainage of the fluid. you might consult with your primary doctor or a ent doctor who can examine you and provide specific advice and treatment. i hope this helps.	for about two years now i have been having a problem with my ears. i know this will probably sound really weird but here's what's been happening. i have had muffled hearing and my ears have felt stuffy. both ears the biggest issue is that when i place my finger just inside my ear canal and apply some pressure and release. there is a very loud crackling and popping sound. it last for 1 or 2 seconds then stops. in both ears the same. i can even feel it bubbling inside my ear. it sounds and feels like some type of fluid.
it depends on the medication that's why it's really important and that you call your pharmacy and ask your pharmacist. some medications you are to take it as soon as possible but other ones you shouldn't be doubling the dose. you take it on your next regularly scheduled time that you're supposed to. but every drug is different. so once again call your pharmacist stop into the pharmacy and ask say this is what happened. we're more than happy to help you figure out that's not a problem at all.	what if you miss a dose you pick it up the next time?

doctors will do an infertility checkup. this involves a physical exam. the doctor will also ask for both partners' health and sexual histories. sometimes this can find the problem. however most of the time the doctor will need to do more tests. in men doctors usually begin by testing the semen. they look at the number shape and movement of the sperm. sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones. in women the first step is to find out if she is ovulating each month. there are a few ways to do this. a woman can track her ovulation at home by: writing down changes in her morning body temperature for several months writing down how her cervical mucus looks for several months using a home ovulation test kit (available at drug or grocery stores) doctors can also check ovulation with blood tests. or they can do an ultrasound of the ovaries. if ovulation is normal there are other fertility tests available. some common tests of fertility in women include: hysterosalpingography (his-tur-oh-sal-ping-gogh-ru-fee): this is an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. doctors inject a special dye into the uterus through the vagina. this dye shows up in the x-ray. doctors can then watch to see if the dye moves freely through the uterus and fallopian tubes. this can help them find physical blocks that may be causing infertility. blocks in the system can keep the egg from moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. a block could also keep the sperm from reaching the egg. laparoscopy (lap-uh-ros-kuh-pee): a minor surgery to see inside the abdomen. the doctor does this with a small tool with a light called a laparoscope (lap-uh-roh-skohp). she or he makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. with the laparoscope the doctor can check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems. doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy. during this surgery doctors use a tool called a laparoscope to see inside the abdomen. the doctor makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. using the laparoscope doctors check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems. doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy. finding the cause of infertility can be a long and emotional process. it may take time to complete all the needed tests. so don't worry if the problem is not found right away.	how will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?

individuals afflicted with social anxiety tend to worry about being judged by others (especially peers). there may be feelings of being rejected coupled with a lack of self-esteem. as a young child this trait is probably rooted in our genetics and protective in nature. it is part of the normal growth and development process. children in this stage may be referred to as being shy. most young children and adolescents outgrow this condition as they enter into adulthood. where you go to meet friends is wide open. depending on your age some places to meet friends may include: school clubs sporting activities the work place and church to name a few. volunteering to help others is a great way to meet new people while contributing to the community. think about joining a speech club. many members of these clubs start out feeling nervous about engaging in public speaking activities and possibly to speaking in smaller social settings. these club members are usually very supportive and enjoy helping newer participants overcome their speaking fears by developing overall self-confidence. take a personal inventory to determine outside- of -the- house activities that you enjoy and look for an opportunity to participate. many local newspapers dedicate column space to advertising upcoming neighborhood events and meetings. yes some individuals with social anxiety tendencies may best respond to talk therapy and/or medication. but overcoming social anxiety disorder is a process that involves having a small number of interpersonal interactions triumphs and building on their success. practice looking people in the eye and greeting them warmly. say good morning to neighbors colleagues at school and work and even to people at the grocery store while waiting in line. the risks are worth the rewards. these positive experiences tend to promote a sense of confidence. from that added confidence we tend to develop more competence in our social exchanges. the pay-off of your risk taking is that a nice positive circle of social interactions should occur. your self-image and self-esteem will improve resulting in a more enriched life.	social anxiety. i want friends where do i go? i have such bad social anxiety when i first get to know someone but then it lessens

“why did i wait so long? ” over my many years of highly specialized practice i have heard that comment very often nearly word for word. patients can procrastinate and delay having elective procedures because their need is not related to serious medical illness or dangerous consequences. if you broke your arm you would need an orthopedic surgeon to set the fracture. if your appendix burst you can’t dilly-dally and put off having a general surgeon perform your appendectomy. but cosmetic plastic surgery is always elective. what that means is that you “elect” to have it done when you want to have it done by whom you want to have it done and how you want to have it done. it is all a matter of choice — not necessity. however what we have learned from patients is that often they waited too long. they could have enjoyed the benefit of the surgery much earlier. one patient said “for years i didn’t like my nose and i couldn’t breathe through it. why i waited so long to have it corrected makes no sense. ” another patient who was having the chemical skin peel a non-surgical process to permanently remove wrinkles age spots and other facial imperfections said “all these years i spent a fortune on makeup and skin treatments both prescription and non-prescription and they didn’t do a darn thing. i should have just gone ahead and had the right procedure done. ” here are the five most common reasons people delay defer and procrastinate: 1. they have more pressing issues in their life. certainly a sick child a divorce or a parent who needs help are reasons that come first. 2. finances. not everyone has the discretionary funds to do it at a given point. often there is a right time and a wrong time to do it depending on how much money you have in the bank. i never recommend doing cosmetic elective surgery with “your last dollar. ” 3. patients have an unrealistic fear of anesthesia. today anesthesia is safer than ever. cosmetic elective procedures are done under very light anesthetic techniques with rapid recovery and very little chance of nausea and vomiting. 4. “i was always afraid of what i would look like. ” well that shouldn’t be a mystery. with computer imaging you can see the predicted results of your procedure on a computer screen even yours at home. and if you have seen surgical results that don’t look right to you just don’t go to the surgeon who showed you those results. if patients look unnatural over-done with a too-tight face lift or an overpinched and scooped nose just stay away from that doctor. 5. “i was afraid of what other people might think. ” to me that is a weak reason. you do it for yourself. not for your parents not for your friends not even for your spouse. you do cosmetic plastic surgery because you want it.	when is the right time for elective plastic surgery?

colds are not the cause of cold sores. cold sores are caused by the herpes virus and yes they can be transmitted if your girlfriend has an active herpes lesion on your lip and you have never had them before. if you yourself had cold sores in the past you already have the herpes viruses in your system so it is unlikely that a new exposure would reactive it.	i kissed my girlfriend when she had a cold for about 1 week and a half i have never had a cold sore will iget them now. have i contracted herpes even though i haven't had symptoms for about 6 months
the only way to make a determination if you have a sprain or a fracture is to have an x-ray of your wrist. there are not home self-exams that could rule out a fracture simply based on symptoms. you will need to see a medical provider. there are many degrees of fractures and sprains (and you can actually have both) so an x-ray is needed to offer a definitive answer.	broken or sprained wrist. i tripped and fell. i don't know if my wrist is broken or sprained. it doesn't hurt much if i leave it resting on my leg or even typing this but if i try to carry something like my laptop or notebook which i usually do with no problem it hurts badly. also i can move it left to right with minor pain but up and down causes the same pain as holding something. also i can move my thumb pretty well with barely any pain. is it broken or sprained?
hi your find that 126/65 is on the lower side of hbp found you this from avogel. co. uk high blood pressure may be a symptom of the menopause. however there is also debate as to whether hrt raises blood pressure. either way if you are or suspect you are suffering from high blood pressure it is worth speaking to your doctor to get to the root of the problem. your blood pressure is the force that your blood exerts on the walls of your arteries. high blood pressure rarely has obvious symptoms and therefore many people are unaware that they are suffering from it. however it is important to keep a check on your blood pressure level because it can develop into serious health conditions such as heart attacks or strokes. so have you been through the menopause yet? if not it could be your answer see your doctor a blood test will tell all form how your hormones are doing. hope this is it. good luck	iam a 54 year old female and never had high blood pressure is 126/65 an acceptable range?

so sorry to hear you're going through this! how unpleasant. many conditions could cause the symptoms you're describing. anything from food poisoning to the flu could be at work here. if you spike a fever (over 101 degrees) then it's time to seek medical attention. if you don't have a thermometer for taking your temperature i recommend you get one. it's impossible to determine whether or not someone has a fever by simply feeling their forehead or judging by whether they're sweating or things like that. you really need to get a thermometer and measure your temperature accurately. if you're not feverish then you probably can take a wait-and-see attitude. drink plenty of fluids and don't try eating anything while you're actively vomiting or nauseated (sick to your stomach). if the symptoms continue to get worse if you get a fever or if you get sharp pains on the right side of your abdomen then it would be a good idea to see a health care provider. i hope you feel better soon! also i keep rotating between overheating and overcooling. have been keeping my sweater on anyways.	i have sharp pains in the stomach and upper intestine areas nausea throwing up and dizzyness should i be concerned? . it's been five hours and it's only getting worse. it started slightly about the belly button then spread to my sides and up.
you're only guaranteed a medigap plan within the first six months of becoming eligible for medicare. after that insurers can take the state of your health into consideration when deciding whether or not to sell you a plan and for how much. that's why experts often suggest people think carefully before switching from traditional medicare to medicare advantage. it's the one part of medicare that doesn't guarantee coverage beyond the initial eligibility period. i would suggest you contact your state health insurance assistance programs for free unbiased help. people there will be familiar with the specific plans available in your state and help walk you through the selection process.	are there any medigap insurance plans in nyc that cover pre-existing conditions with no 6-month waiting period? . 81 years old i would like to switch from my current coverage medicare advantage plan (aarp) to traditional medicare plus part f medigap plus part d during open enrollment but was diagnosed with peripheral t-cell lymphoma in september. will my age and pre-existing condition affect my premium?

baby : your baby measures 5 to 5. 6 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 5. 25 ounces. the rapid growth spurt is tapering off but reflexes are kicking in. it can yawn stretch and make facial expressions even frown. taste buds are beginning to develop and can distinguish sweet from bitter tastes. the baby will suck if its lips are stroked and it can swallow and even get the hiccups. the retinas have become sensitive to light so if a bright light is shined on your abdomen baby will probably move to shield its eyes. mom-to-be : your uterus about the size of a cantaloupe can probably be felt just below your navel. you're most likely feeling the baby move by now. a mid-pregnancy ultrasound may be performed between now and 22 weeks to assess fetal growth and development and to verify the due date. if the baby is in the right position the ultrasound may even be able to determine whether it's a boy or a girl. your heart has to work 40 percent to 50 percent harder now to support your pregnancy. tip for the week : suggest that your partner go with you for the ultrasound. it's a chance to catch the first glimpse of your baby together as well as provide a snapshot to show friends and family later. sonograms still don't guarantee a healthy baby but they can provide reassurance and spot some problems.	what can i expect during week 18 of my pregnancy?
hi this is from the uk’s nhs. athlete’s foot is a common fungal infection of the foot. an itchy red rash develops in the spaces between your toes. the affected skin may also be scaly flaky and dry. the medical name for athlete’s foot is tinea pedis. harmless bacteria and fungi live naturally on your skin but if these organisms multiply your skin can become infected. a group of fungi called dermatophytes is responsible for athlete’s foot. dermatophytes live in and feed off dead skin tissue. your feet provide a warm dark and humid environment – ideal conditions for the fungi to live and multiply. athlete's foot spreads very easily. it can be passed from person to person through contaminated towels clothing and surfaces. the fungi can survive and multiply in warm and humid places such as swimming pools showers and changing rooms. but then who wears socks in these places? do hope this helps you. good luck	can a person wearing socks in a place like a gym or a home prevent them from picking up athlete's foot? . i am opening a daycare and children like to take off their shoes and some even like to take off their socks. i am trying to find out if wearing socks is enough of a barrier to prevent someone from picking up the fungus somehow and transmitting it.

an ear infection happens when germs such as viruses or bacteria get into the middle ear. this can often happen during or after your child has a cold or runny nose. middle ear infections are very common and occur a lot in kids under 4 because of their ear tubes being smaller. many of these ear infections go away by themselves and some may need antibiotics. because the ear infection is in the middle ear it is not contagious. if the infection is in the outer ear the part closest to the ear lobe it is called an outer ear infection. outer ear infections can occur after kids swim. these are not contagious either and usually just need some antibiotic eardrops to make them get better. if you think your child has an ear infection see your doctor. but remember it will get better soon!	are ear infections contagious?

if you have significant blockage in the carotid arteries in your neck you may need a carotid endarterectomy. during this surgical procedure a surgeon removes plaque buildup in the carotid arteries to reduce the risk of transient ischemic attack (tia) or stroke. the benefits and risks of this surgery must be carefully weighed because the surgery itself may cause a stroke. your need to have carotid endarterectomy depends on whether you have had a tia and how much your carotid arteries have narrowed. you are most likely to benefit from surgery if you have had a tia in the past 6 months and you have 70% or greater narrowing in one of your carotid arteries. carotid endarterectomy may also be appropriate if your carotid arteries are moderately or severely blocked (50% to 70%) and you have had one or more tias. 10 talk to your doctor about whether a carotid endarterectomy is right for you. a relatively new procedure called carotid artery stenting is another option for some people who are at high risk of stroke. this procedure is much like coronary angioplasty which is commonly used to open blocked arteries in the heart. during this procedure a vascular surgeon inserts a metal tube called a stent inside your carotid artery to increase blood flow in areas blocked by plaque. the surgeon may use a stent that is coated with medicine to help prevent future blockage. carotid artery stenting is not as common as endarterectomy. each person must carefully weigh the benefits and risks of surgery and compare them with the benefits and risks of using medicine to reduce the risk of tia or stroke. the success of either treatment will depend on the amount of blockage you have and which medicine you use. risks of surgery depend on your age your health status the skill and experience of the surgeon and the experience of the medical center where the surgery is done. surgery choices carotid endarterectomy what to think about carotid endarterectomies are most successful when they are done by a surgeon who is well trained in the procedure and in a hospital that is well equipped to take care of any complications that may occur during or after the procedure. if you are considering carotid endarterectomy ask the hospital or state medical board about the number of times complications have occurred in people that your doctor has treated with this surgery and the complication rate at the hospital where the surgery is to be done. the american heart association stroke council recommends that surgery be performed by a surgeon who has complications in less than 3% of those treated and that the hospital rate of complications be just as low. 10 while carotid endarterectomy is often not done until several months after a tia a large study showed that people benefit most from the surgery if it is done within 2 weeks of a tia. delaying surgery longer than 2 weeks increases the risk for stroke because people are more likely to have a stroke in the first few days and weeks after a tia. these results also point out why it is so important to see a doctor immediately if you have any signs of tia. 11 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for transient ischemic attack tia?

the symptoms of heart failure are related to the changes that occur to your heart and body and may be moderate to severe depending on how weak your heart is. the symptoms can include: congested lungs. fluid back up in the lungs can cause shortness of breath with exercise or difficulty breathing at rest which is often worse when lying flat in bed. lung congestion can also cause a dry hacking cough or wheezing. fluid and water retention. less blood to your kidneys causes fluid and water retention resulting in swollen ankles legs and abdomen (called edema) and weight gain. symptoms may cause an increased need to urinate during the night. bloating in your stomach may cause a loss of appetite or nausea. dizziness fatigue and weakness. less blood to your major organs and muscles makes you feel tired and weak. less blood to the brain can cause dizziness or confusion. rapid or irregular heartbeats. the heart beats faster to pump enough blood to the body. this can cause a fast or irregular heartbeat. if you have heart failure you may have one or all of these symptoms or you may have none of them. in addition your symptoms may not be related to how weak your heart is; you may have many symptoms but your heart function may be only mildly weakened. or you may have a more severely damaged heart but have no symptoms.	what are the symptoms of heart failure?
in general it is best to keep the focus on healthy eating and activity. it sounds like you are already doing a great job of emphasizing healthy habits. physical fitness basically how well your child's body works as she plays and learns (for exampler her energy level endurance strength) and not size is key. combatting the media's and society's biases about physical appearance is not easy. offering counter-examples of healthy (and realistic) body types might be something to try if she is a fairly mature 5-yr-old. also maybe showing the graph of bmis on the growth chart to your daughter might allow you to show her that she is tracking along just fine and that she is in the healthy range. i think this sounds like something that should be explored in depth with your pediatrician or a counselor. here's a few body image related articles for parents who might be facing this situation with older children. eating and body image: a troubled relationship moms kids and body image	my daughter is 5 years old and obsessed with her weight. is she developing an unhealthy body image?
typically when you are taking a medication that makes you more sensitive to sun sunscreen alone is not going to be enough. you really have to have sun smart behavior. what this means is trying to stay in the shade as much as possible and you can follow the shadow rule. the shorter your shadow the more dangerous the rays of the sun. so when you look down and there is no shadow; typically that's around noon you look up chances are the sun is right above you and that's when those uvb rays are very harmful. most medications that make you sensitive to the sun are really making you sensitive to the uva rays so it doesn't always have to be a sunny day in order for you to have increased risk for burning. so don't be fooled by whether or not it's sunny or cloudy. one is you can follow the shadow rule but two is you really have to be sun smart. wear a hat when you can wear sun protective clothing if possible. apply a sunscreen of an spf 30 or higher up to an spf 50 after that it doesn't make much difference and reapply that sunscreen regularly and then avoid being in the sun as much as possible.	i am taking a medication and my pharmacist says that i have to be careful in the sun. isn't wearing sunscreen enough?

what a foolish thing to do. unprotected sex with prostitutes puts you in the high risk category for just about every std on the planet. you must definitely be tested. and re-tested (since some stds are not immediately apparent). prophylactic medications may not give you the reassurance since not all stds can be treated with simple antibiotics.	i had unprotected sex with 2 bar girls in the phiippines. should i get tested for stds and/or take any prophylactic meds

"a ""drug test"" could mean many things but most employers are checking for common drugs of abuse such as opioids cannabis alcohol and certain prescription drugs. unless your employer specifically wants to test for steroid use this would not usually be included in a drug screen. you would have to ask ""what are they testing for? "". the real issue here is a concern that you may be the worried steroid-user. if this is true you need to do some in-depth investigation on the long-term use of steroids. the short-term gains that you may experience is not worth the long-term medical issues that steroid can cause."	will steroids show up on a random drug test given by an employer? thanks a lot guys.
it would not be wise to self-diagnose yourself as having a secondary bacterial infection from your recent viral illness and self-prescribed ampicillin. it would be advisable for you to be properly examined and diagnosed first by a medical professional. ampicillin is not used very much any more so it is unlikely that even if you did have a bacterial infection this would not be the antibiotic of choice. signs of secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia as a result of a respiratory virus would be a high fever a worsening cough with expectoration of dark phlegm chest discomfort rapid respiration and lethargy. a mild sore throat or runny nose does not necessarily indicate a need for ampicillin.	how can i know if my cold/flu has become bacterial? so i can take a ampicillin? . i am aware that ampicillin does nothing if my cold/flu is a virus but i have been sick for a week now and although my body isn't sore/weak anymore i still cough up alot of mucus and coughing hurts my chest a bit and i have a sore throat also runny nose with alot of mucus as well.
hi getting pregnant after implanon seems a bit of a hit and miss some have got pregnant within 2 months others well let say the time span just gets longer. then for some women getting pregnant is all down to timing. i would give it a couple of months then seek help but even then you may be told to just wait. do hope this helps. good luck	i had the implanon removed five months ago an i still can't get pregnant. what should i do to help me. i had implanon for 3yr an now had it out for 5 months. i got a bleed right after that lasted 3 days then went to a 28 day cycle. but for the last 2 months i've been a couple of days late. so i thought i was pregnant then i start. is there something i could do to help? or does it always take a long time for women to get pregnant after implanon?
in the past there was little evidence one way or the other on how well condoms lowered the risk for specific stds. anti-condom forces used that fact to argue that condoms don’t protect. but now findings show that condom use can lower the risk of infection -- not only of hiv/aids but of many other stds. a 2006 study by university of washington researchers found that women whose partners consistently used condoms were half as likely to be infected with human papillomavirus. for hiv/aids consistent and careful condom use can lower the risk of infection by a whopping 90%. when researchers from the national center for chronic disease prevention reviewed results from 45 studies looking at gonorrhea and chlamydia infection they found solid evidence that condoms reduce the risk of these two stds as well. the bottom line: condoms don’t offer 100% protection but they can certainly lower your risk -- and the risk of your partner.	how well do condoms prevent stds?

if you have routinely taken your birth control pills with no lapses it would be very rare indeed to become pregnant. but not impossible. you should see a gynecologist immediately for a serum pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant. no one who is pregnant should take birth control pills but you do not give any indication of being pregnant other than your perception that your abdomen looks larger. normally this is not a sign of very early pregnancy. under typical circumstances a woman's pregnancy doesn't start showing for at least four or five weeks. again though just to be safe you should get to a doctor's office as soon as possible to find out for sure what's going on. wishing you well!	is it dangerous to get pregnant while taking yaz contaception. i have been taking the pill continuously for two years. i have never been late and i have no pregnancy symptoms except my stomach looks bigger. . i had a pap smear in mid november two regular periods in december and january. my last regular period was two weeks ago. . i took a pregnancy test in mid december that was negative. i just took another one and it came up positive immediately. i am now concerned that the baby may have birth defects due to taking yaz?

most helpful answer you can get an infection from any scratch. a dog a stick a fingernail etc. a dog is really no more risky than any of those things. basically anything that breaks the protective integrity of your skin has the potential of causing a secondary infection. you have done the proper thing by immediately washing the wound using an antiseptic and a topical antibiotic. changes are good that you will not get an infection but if you see progressive redness swelling or pain at the scratch site this could be a sign that the wound is becoming infected.	can you get an infection from a superfical dog scratch? . the scratch didn't bleed and it was cleaned with hydrogen peroxide and applied neosporin after.

if you have symptoms of a stroke it's important to seek immediate medical attention. one-sided weakness can be a sign of stroke. here are other common symptoms: sudden vision changes sudden problems walking sudden severe headache sudden inability to speak most of the time the symptoms of stroke come on suddenly but this is not always the case. if your one-sided weakness has developed gradually and seems to be getting worse you should see a doctor. i can't think of any reason why anxiety would cause one-sided weakness. i suppose it's possible it could be a medication side-effect but this still deserves to be checked out. i suggest you call your doctor as soon as possible. best wishes to you!	diagnosed with anxiety have stroke symptoms weakness onleft side leg and arm is this normal?
i don't know. i never had the opportunity to reach a personal limit (which in most cases is considerably less than what your mind creates). sex like any physical activity can border on being addictive. i have known runnersand cyclists that were so addicted to the high from running/cycling that the could not stop even for a day. if your sexual activity is interfering with your daily activities or the activities of your partner(s) then it could be a problem for you. people can be obsessively hypersexual for sure like a nymphomaniac. if your hypersexual activity is risky (multiple partners unsafe practices etc. ) then you may need some professional help. if you are just having a active sex life with a willing partner then consider yourself a very lucky person.	is it possible to have too much sex?
pregnant women with genital herpes should be careful about passing the virus on to the baby but not overly worried about it. a mother can infect her baby during delivery often fatally. but if a woman had genital herpes before getting pregnant or if she is first infected early in pregnancy the chance that her baby will be infected is very low -- less than 1%. women with genital herpes are examined carefully for any symptoms before giving birth. if sores or signs that an outbreak is coming show up at the time of delivery the baby may be delivered by cesarean section (also called a c-section). the risk of infecting the baby is high (30% to 50%) when a woman is newly infected late in pregnancy however. that's because the mother's immune system has not developed protective antibodies against the virus. women with an older herpes infection have antibodies against the virus which help protect the baby. if you are pregnant and you think you may have been infected recently tell your doctor right away.	what happens if a pregnant woman has genital herpes?
hi found you this answer from netdoctor. co. uk it should interest you as its all about your little problem. inverted nipples are quite common but women are not often aware of this because it is not a popular topic of conversation. inverted nipples are sometimes regarded with a degree of embarrassment although there is no reason for this. i don't think your own situation is going to be too much of a problem because your nipples are capable of 'coming out' (becoming everted). this is probably more noticeable when you are cold or aroused. your nipples contain some erectile tissue that causes them to become more prominent. the biological reason for this is to aid breastfeeding. although your nipples may be flat or inverted a lot of the time when the erectile tissue is stimulated they stick out. you can encourage them to be more permanently erect by rolling the nipples between thumb and forefinger frequently perhaps several times a day over a period of time. also gently pulling on the nipple when it is erect can help make this state more permanent. you can also buy nipple shields to use. these are designed really for women in pregnancy who want to improve their chances of breastfeeding but there is no reason why non-pregnant women can't use them. they consist of a circular plastic disc with a central hole. the disc exerts pressure on the tissue around the nipple and encourages the nipple to protrude through the central hole. they can be worn at any time. in pregnancy many women find their flat or inverted nipples become everted anyway in association with the breast changes and enlargement of pregnancy. i certainly would not advise surgery for this benign condition. yours sincerely the netdoctor medical team do hope this helps you. good luck	i don't know if my nipples are inverted are not. (13 yo started period) they aren't like most girls. i started my period not that long ago and i realized that my nipples aren't normal. they're just puffy/smooth with no bud. when i'm cold they look stiffer or slightly more tighter? there still wouldn't be a bud. i did the test where you pinch the areola and it worked but i still don't know if it's effective because i'm young. this makes me very self-conscious no matter how much people say i shouldn't be. is this a part of puberty? will they stay this way? if so how can i change them? help!

"i would need to ask this patient what they have been taking and if their problem is falling asleep or staying asleep. over-the-counter sleep aids try to help you fall asleep but not stay asleep. in some cases if you have taken products too long you can end up with a condition called ""rebound insomnia""-- which means you get another episode of insomnia possibly worse than the first. if the problem is staying asleep i would advise that you see your doctor or healthcare provider for further evaluation and possible prescription medication."	why can't i sleep even when i take a sleep aid?

i believe that marjuana is a great pain reliever if used in moderation very little side effects save giggles. those who suffer liver disease and chronic back pain would be served much better by this drug. i hsve little to no appetite pills are pysically addictive and i would much rather smoke a joint than drink. i can no longer drink i quit drinking before my liver went cirrhotic and while everyone drank in the bar i would smoke out back with other non-drinkers sitting around a bonfire. i lost my urge to drink and drank coffee instead. when i got in trouble for marjuana psession i was forced to do random u/as thus making me quit. so to kill the pain i drank again now i'm sick.	what are advantages/disadvatages in taking med marijuana. i have chronic daily headaches (chronic headache syndrome) ptsd anxiety/frequent anxiety attacks which lead to twitching and convulsions depression migraines convulsions and more. i have been taking zoloft for my depression and i have 4 different therapists/psychologists/psychotherapists which i all frequently see. i don't like taking mainstream medications because i don't like putting harmful chemicals in my body and i don't like the way they make me feel sometimes.
as a man ages his prostate can grow larger. when a man reaches the age of 40 his prostate gland might have increased from the size of a walnut to that of an apricot. by the time he reaches the age of 60 it might be the size of a lemon. because it surrounds part of the urethra the enlarged prostate can squeeze the urethra. this causes problems in the passing of urine. typically these problems passing urine don't occur in men until they are age 50 or older. they can though occur earlier. an enlarged prostate is also called benign (noncancerous) prostatic hyperplasia. it is common and cannot be prevented. age and a family history of bph are risk factors. eight out of every 10 men eventually develop an enlarged prostate. about 90% of men over the age of 85 will have bph. about 30% of men will find their symptoms bothersome.	what is benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) or an enlarged prostate?
