answer	question
cerebral palsy can be so variable that without knowing the details of his particular cp involvement it would not be possible for me to offer you a specific answer but generally a teenager with cp can play sports. i admire you for being concerned and cooperative. it was be best for his medical provider to sign a medical clearance -- someone who knows his case. many kids with cp perhaps because of the muscle involvement with this disorder may become more fatigued. if he has some underlying respiratory or cardiac problem then this will need to be evaluated by his medical provider before clearing him for sports participation. kids with cp should be supported and encourage to do many activities so if he can make the team i don't think you will need to worry about his safety any more than the other kids.	is it safe to allow a tennager who has cerebral palsy to play basketball? . i coach a basketball team for high school aged kids and one of my players has cerebral palsy. he played on the team last year but we were very concerned about his condition and his safety but his parents seemed to have no problem with him playing. my coaching staff and i were very concerned about how safe it would be to allow him to play again this year as last yer he could not stay on the court very long without looking very exhausted. is it safe to continue to let him play?

bodily movements are regulated by a portion of the brain called the basal ganglia whose cells require a proper balance of two substances called dopamine and acetylcholine both involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. in parkinson's cells that produce dopamine begin to degenerate throwing off the balance of these two neurotransmitters. researchers believe that genetics sometimes plays a role in the cellular breakdown. in rare instances parkinson's disease may be caused by a viral infection or by exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides carbon monoxide or the metal manganese. but in the great majority of parkinson's cases the cause is unknown.	what causes parkinson's disease?

co-sleeping isn’t recommended because of what we know about sleep safety. there’s more of a risk of smothering sudden infant death syndrome and of falls off the adult bed when there’s bedsharing. if you’re breastfeeding often and you want the baby close one option is to use a bedside co-sleeper. it looks like a crib with a missing side and you can put it right next to the adult bed and raise it up to the bed’s height but an adult can’t accidentally roll over on the baby. if you’re feeding baby often you can also consider putting a bassinet cradle or crib nearby.	is bringing my baby to bed with me -- co-sleeping -- safe?

dizziness can occur anytime during middle to late pregnancy. here's why it happens: the hormone progesterone dilates blood vessels so blood tends to pool in the legs. more blood is also going to your growing uterus. this can cause a drop in blood pressure especially when changing positions -- and that can make you dizzy. if your blood sugar levels get too low you may feel faint. recommendations: move around often when standing for long periods of time. lie on your left side to rest. this helps circulation throughout your body. avoid sudden movements. move slowly when standing from a sitting position. eat regular small meals throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar.	how can i manage dizziness or feeling faint during pregnancy?

your bmi - body mass index is 30. 4 kg/m2. generally we perform bariatric surgery to achieve permanent weight loss for any patient whose bmi is 30 kg/m2 or above. liposuction is not a treatment option for weight loss. it is a cosmetic procedure for body shaping. there is a set point for fat storage for everyone. this is not altered by liposuction. weight loss by liposuction diet control exercise naturopathy amway herbalife etc. is temporary as all these methods do not have any effect on set point for fat storage. so any fat that is removed in liposuction will reaccumulate over a period of 6 months to two years. those who can reduce weight by diet control and exercise does not need liposuction and those who cannot reduce weight by above methods will not reduce even after liposuction. bariatric surgery provides permanent weight loss as it lowers set point for fat storage. if you are looking for permanent weight loss then bariatric surgery is the only scientifically proven method for that. for further information consult a general surgeon online --> <link>	"Hi doctor,I am planning to go for liposuction to lose weight.

it starts with communication with your doctor and pharmacist. make sure you know why you are taking all of your medications. this way you can try to minimize redundancy. ask your doctor for recommendations regarding when to take each medication – it might make sense to take your “water pill” earlier in the day so you aren’t woken up at night by the urge to go the bathroom. ask you doctor if routine liver or kidney laboratory testing is appropriate. bring your medication list with you to every doctor’s appointment or emergency room visit. one of the biggest causes of medication errors or side effects is when doctors prescribe people medications that they don’t tolerate or when similar medications are already being prescribed. remember that supplements can have side effects and may interact with your medications – know what you are taking and why you are taking it. when making changes in your medications it’s best to make one change at a time – that way you can identify the likely cause if a side effect occurs. take advantage of the pharmacist’s offer to counsel you regarding new medications.	what steps can i take to reduce my risk of serious drug side effects?

knowing when you are about to release your egg can help decrease stress and increase the effectiveness of trying to conceive. while sperm can survive for up to 6 days in the female body eggs survive twelve hours. therefore most pregnancies occur when sperm are waiting for the egg. while babies have been conceived with acts of intercourse up to 6 days prior to ovulation the hightest chance of conception is within the two days prior to ovulation. learning to interpret your body's signals can help you find your fertility. cervical mucus. as the egg approaches ovulation increasing amounts of estrogen are produced and cervical mucus becomes sticky or stringy like egg whites. consistency changes as the water content of the mucus increases making penetration by sperm easier. cervical mucus changes can be identified up to 6 days prior to ovulation. timing intercourse when you notice your cervical mucus changing can be effective in helping you to conceive. ovulation predictor kits. opks detect luteinizing hormone (lh) or both lh and estradiol. as the egg moves closer to ovulation estradiol rises. while estradiol rises lh is released in increasing quantities then drops creating the lh surge that precedes egg release by 24-48 hours. to use an opk you urinate on the wick daily and look at the test kit window. with most kits one line means urine made it into the kit and two lines means lh is detected. kits that detect both estradiol and lh read low peak when estradiol only is detected and high peak when both estradiol and lh is detected. if you are able to detect the surge on the kit intercourse the day of the surge and the day after the surge should provide sperm for the arriving egg. basal body tempteratures once the egg is released progesterone is produced. progesterone increases body temperature. therefore your temperature goes up after ovulation. the best time to take your temperature is before you get out of bed in the morning. if you chart your temperature daily you should see at least an 0. 3 degree rise in the baseline temperature the day after ovulation. temperature should stay up until shortly before the period. if you have conceived your temperature will stay up during pregnancy. unlike cervical mucus changes and ovulation predictor kits basal body temperatures do not let you know that you are about to ovulate. rather they tell you that you have. so if you want to use them to time intercourse you need to chart for a month to see when you ovulated and then plan to have intercourse in the cycle days prior to the temperature rise during the next month. since menstrual cycles can be different from month to month this method can be frustrating to some. once you have seen that there is a temperature rise and that your temperature stays up for approximately 2 weeks you may wish to stop checking daily temperatures to decrease the stress of trying to conceive. if however you find the daily temperatures reassuring feel free to continue. don't worry. not all women can detect all of the signs of ovulation. follow whichever of the signs works for you. if you are unable to detect any of the changes discussed here you may not be ovulating. see your physician to make the final determination with a blood test for progesterone timed one week after the surge on your opk or rise in temperature which should be one week before your period. if you are not ovulating your physician can try to determine the cause and give you medications to help you release your egg. if the thought of testing for ovulation is frustrating to you intercourse two to three times a week should cover your fertile window.	how can i tell when i am most fertile?

"there can be many reasons but night terrors would be the most likely. he may be having vivid dreams so real to him that it can frighten him. he may not remember having these dreams but he will wake up (some times) and need comfort. some children can just cry or scream in their sleep without fully waking up. some will get out of bed and come to you. night terrors can last a while and their may be little that can be done to prevent all of these episodes assuming that the does not have any underlying medical reasons for these awakenings. read to him before he goes to bed. read a nice story; a fun story. get his little mind focused on bunnies not scary things. be careful what he sees on television including commercials for movies that can be frightening to him. try to explain dreams to him (it may be difficult at this age) but do what you can to encourage ""sweet dreams"". a night light may be helpful in his room soft music or white noise (waterfall sounds rain sounds babbling brooks) are also helpful. there are white noise machines that are relatively inexpensive. this may help him to rest better. before he goes to bed to quiet activities. don't chase him around the house and get him all excited. these things will pass in time with love and support. for more information and other suggestions on dealing with ""night terrors"" an internet search will be very fruitful."	why is my 20 month old waking up during night crying uncontrollably?

current home pregnancy tests (hpts) are advertised to be sensitive on the first day of a missed period—or perhaps a few days before. in the most recent review of accuracy of hpts published in august of 2011 such claims were tested. one brand first response® detected 97% of pregnancies on the first day of a missed period. the ept® manual (54%) and digital (67%); and the clear blue® manual (64%) and digital (54%) tests all detected fewer actual pregnancies. these results may reflect that the first response® could detect as little as 5. 5 miu/ml of hcg in the urine while the other two brands could detect 22 miu/ml. generally speaking a reliable pregnancy test in a doctor’s office should be able to detect a level of 22 units of hcg or higher. remember it takes an implantation to produce hcg to trigger a test. in a study where day of implantation was documented with a sensitive blood test it was determined that 10% of viable pregnancies were not yet implanted by the first day of the missed period! having read all this you can now understand why a gyn may recommend using a hpt twice if the first instance is at the time of missed flow. about 97% of viable pregnancies will have implanted by seven days after the first day of missed menses. taking a second reading can also enhance accuracy where your hpt is not one of the super-sensitive brands.	had sex on fertile days when should i check if pregnant?

your alternating dry-peeling beard area sounds more complex than one might expect on first glance. first use a simple non-irritating shave gel such as nivea or aveeno oatmeal. always shave with a nice sharp fresh blade. if your skin is peeling it is dry and irritated you may actually have a skin allergy. i would suggest you definitely see a dermatologist to set up a proper skincare regime. in the meantime avoid any scrubs with glycolic or salicylic acids as these will dry you further. when all else fails for dryness and flaking good old-fashioned vaseline may help. .	my skin is scaly especially with shaving. it is also becomes very dry from sun. is there a cream that can help this?
the infection is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). after hiv is in the body it attacks and destroys cd4+ cells which are the part of the body's immune system that fights infection and disease. when hiv weakens or destroys the immune cells it may lead to certain illnesses or diseases such as some types of pneumonia or cancer that are more likely to develop in someone who has a weakened immune system. these conditions are a sign that hiv has progressed to aids. hiv is spread when blood semen or vaginal fluids from an infected person enter another person's body usually through sexual contact from sharing needles when injecting drugs or from mother to baby during birth. hiv is rarely spread by blood transfusions or organ transplants in the united states because of improved screening procedures. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection?

simply eating a balanced healthy diet will support your body in building white blood cells. there are no specific foods you can eat that will speed up the process. making white blood cells requires a supply of nutrients including amino acids and purines. beans peas spinach and lean protein (like chicken and fish) are rich in these nutrients. however even relatively poor diets provide adequate material to make a normal white blood cell count unless something else is wrong. a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) is not due to inadequate nutrition except possibly in cases of extreme starvation. people with leukopenia have either a high rate of destruction of white blood cells or the body is limited in making them for some other reason. eating a healthy diet won’t build white blood cells faster but does have many other health benefits.	how can i build white blood cells with food?
although i cannot see your scar first hand as a wound heals it may produce more scarring tissue. this can often dissipate in about a year. in some cases the scar tissue can become quite prominent forming a keloid. if you are concerned about the current appearance of your scar you will need to see a medical provider to examine it first-hand.	what is happening to my scar? . between 3-4 weeks ago i cut under my eye which i had steri strips to close the wound it seemed to be healing well however now there is a lump on the scar which is slightly bigger width than the scar was itself. it is the same colour as the rest of the scar and also painless.

technically yes. if sperm from the cowper's gland i see no logical reason why sperm wouldn't also survive traveling on fingers. sperm are not fragile. they are extremely tough. the journey they take to reach the egg is like running a marathon but with toxins traps & fluids rushing at you. they can also live up to 5 days after ejaculation. you can watch the journey that sperm take on youtube. it's incredible. the risk of pregnancy is very low and the semen needs to still be very moist too be alive but yes you can get pregnant.

go see a doctor. he or she will talk to you and take a history of your health problems. many people have lupus for a long time before they find out they have it. it's important that you tell the doctor or nurse about your symptoms. this information along with a physical examination and the results of laboratory tests helps the doctor decide whether you have lupus or something else. a rheumatologist (room-uh-tall-uh-jist) is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases that affect the joints and muscles like lupus. you may want to ask your regular doctor for a referral to a rheumatologist. in some cases a dermatologist a doctor who specializes in treating diseases that affect the skin may be involved in diagnosis and treatment. no single test can show that you have lupus. your doctor may have to run several tests and study your medical history. it may take time for the doctor to diagnose lupus.	how do i know if i have lupus?

the mainstay of treatments are still oral and or topical antibiotics along with benzoyl peroxide washes and topical retinoids. in severe cases a type of surgery called marsupialization can be done to more definitively treat the condition; however there is often scarring from the procedure so it is often reserved for the worst cases. oral isotretinoin is also used with some benefit in getting the condition under control; however topical treatments are needed to maintain clearance over time.	i have had hidradenitis. are there any new treatments?
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this and experiencing such anxiety. i'd suggest you make a phone call to get an appointment with a gynecologist as soon as possible to set your mind at ease. many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe from a vaginal yeast infection to a urinary tract infection to a sexually transmitted disease. the only way to diagnose this properly is through a physical exam by a medical professional. what you're describing does not sound like a medical emergency so please do not run to the emergency room. just get an appointment with your gynecologist or with a women's health center as soon as you can. best wishes to you!	what can cause vaginal discharge and pain? . im having vaginal pain not only when i pee its all the time and im have the sensation that i am peeing my pants. i ahvent had sex in at leadt 5 days and the pain just started 2 days ago im just really concerned on whats going on with me
"you will need to see your health care provider or gynecologist for a proper examination to determine the true nature of this ""lump"". your description is just too vague for me to be able to narrow down the several possibilities but one common lump could be a bartholin gland cyst. you can do a little research to see if that fits the bill. the fact that this lump is bigger and more painful emphasizes the importance of medical intervention."	i have a lump on my vagina that came back after it went away for a week it came back alot more painful and alot bigger

women are at greatest risk for depression around puberty post partum and around menopause statistically. . these are times when estrogen levels falter; i think serotonin and neurotrophic factors (brain growth and health chemicals) also falter. this likely conveys some risk for depression. let's face it these times are also stressful for women which raises depression risk. given the recurrence of your depression i would suggest that whatever med you take next that resolves your depression stick with it much much longer to hopefully prevent future depressions.	i have a history of depression and am entering menopause. i was diagnosed with major depression. are hormones to blame?
pre-existing conditions will no longer prevent you from being sold a health plan. insurers are now prohibited from taking a person's health into consideration. you also cannot be charged more for your plan because of the state of your health. given your situation you may qualify for medicaid because many states are expanding the program's eligibility. otherwise you can look to your state's health insurance marketplace for a private insurance policy. you're likely to qualify for financial assistance that will lower the cost of your plan.	how will someone like me receive coverage that actually covers me? . i am unemployed but not poverty-stricken and have two pre-existing conditions. how am i going to be covered for these types of pre-existing conditions?

probably what happened is what’s called a penile fracture. it really isn’t a break like the break of a bone. but there’s two chambers within the penis that hold the blood the corpora cavernosa. and it’s a very thin-walled structure that becomes very distended very tense and that’s where the rigidity of the erection occurs. in certain rare circumstances the torqueing the stretch on that is enough to pop and crack one of those chambers. classically the man will experience severe excruciating pain sudden disappearance of the erection horrible pain with blood the penis will become purple cracking sound and close but almost excruciating pain and that’s a surgical emergency. they have to stop what they’re doing and go immediately to the emergency room. it may require surgical intervention. the risk of that is because of the risk of the scar from the healing of the tear men can end up with curvature and even permanent impotence. the good news is it’s fairly rare almost always occurs in very aggressive wild sex usually women on top what happens is the penis comes out vaginal vault but goes back in and misses hits the pubic bone in the woman and that’s enough for the organ to pop.	i heard a crack while having sex and now i’ve lost my erection.
firstly let me tell you that sonography is not always suggestive of adenomyosis. it cannot diagnose it. for diagnosis you have to send biopsy of the uterus. in adenomyosis there is pain before during and after menses. there is also focal and diffuse type of adenomyosis. whatever you read on the internet is about diffuse or generalized adenomyosis. a few things on focal adenomyosis are available because most of the time it goes undiagnosed or has very mild symptoms that do not hamper routine. so just focus on the present and start trying for pregnancy. in fact if you get pregnant and pregnancy goes up to term or near term then there is a chance of cure from adenomyosis theoretically. if you do not have the symptoms of clear adenomyosis then there is a chance that it is not adenomyosis. so do not worry and take chance for a year. if you do not get pregnant then consult a gynecologist as normal people. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --><link>	Hello doctor,I am 29 years old.

"it's tough to use the term ""cure"" for any chronic medical condition whether it's bipolar disorder (or as you put it ""manic depression"") or osteoarthritis. as you point out these conditions often can be managed through medication. when i say ""managed "" i mean the symptoms of the condition can be minimized. however these medications do not ""cure"" the condition because if you stop taking the medication then the symptoms return. with bipolar disorder it's important to take medications daily and to check in with your psychiatrist or psychologist on a regular basis. while a person with bipolar disorder may need to take medications for the rest of his or her life the dosage may need to change or the medication itself may need to be changed. new medicines are always coming on the market and often new-generation drugs not only work better than older ones but have fewer side effects. if anyone tries to convince you there's a ""cure"" for bipolar (""manic depression"") you should politely ignore them. do not allow anyone to talk you into going off your medications. there is no cure for bipolar. you should keep taking your medicines and rely on your doctor's expertise and advice. wishing you well! there is no cure for manic depression but there are very effective and natural way for managing the symptoms such as mood swings and helping you get back to a normal routine. learn more from the mr. mahendra trivedi at ""the trivedi effect"" about natural and effective ways and options for manic depressive disorder."	is there a cure for manic-depression? . besides controlling it's effects with medication on daily basis.

assuming you're not allergic to ibuprofen the answer is yes. by all means take some for the pain of strep throat. ugh! ibuprofen doesn't interact with antibiotics so it's ok to take everything at the same time (if you also were given oral antibiotics). if you are an adult you should not take more than 2400mg of ibuprofen in a 24-hour period. you can divide that up in different ways but you should never take more than 800mg of ibuprofen at a time. children's dosing for ibuprofen is significantly different from adult dosing. if you weigh less than 95 pounds you should consult a pharmacist for directions on how to take ibuprofen. wishing you well! yes you can 2 ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed	i was given an antibiotic shot for strep throat. can i also take ibuprofen? . i was given the shot at 8:30 this morning. i forgot to ask if i could take ibuprofen for the pain.
aerobic exercise and resistance training are both beneficial for diabetes and lower the hemoglobin a1c levels. structured exercise programs typically produce better results than “exercise advice” simply because the structured exercise programs achieve greater intensity and duration and greater compliance than when patients are left to their own devices to get the recommended exercise. in fact studies with “exercise advice” typically produced no improvement in the hemoglobin a1c (due to poor compliance) unless dietary improvements were also made. the best combination is always simultaneous dietary improvement plus exercise (cardio and/or resistance) and the more “structured” or “formalized” the better. in fact while patients who achieve the standard recommended “2. 5 hours per week” see greater improvements in hemoglobin a1c than those who do not meet this standard; those patients who exceed the standard get even greater improvements!	what kind of exercise is beneficial for people with diabetes?

at age 19 there is a very good chance that you have stopped growing. your growth plates may have already closed so the chance of you achieving more height may be futile. our height is genetically-determined for the most part so the day you were conceived your dna was already been programmed for your adult height. you can see an endocrinologist and get an x-ray to see if your growth plates have closed. if they have you are at your adult height now. there is nothing medically that can change this so don't waste money on unproven treatments or quackery. there are no rules that state a son will follow the height pattern of the father. you may end up splitting the difference between your parents. my mother was 61 inches tall; my father was 74 inches tall. i am 70 inches; my youngest brother is 63 inches and my oldest brother is 73 inches. my son is 75 inches.	i am male born in 1994(19). my height is 163 i wanna grow atleast 173. is that possible for me if yes than please tell? . my father and younger brother having height of around 170. my mother is having height of 157.

routinely the root canal treatment has three steps in total. pulp extirpation. root canal preparation. root canal filling. since you have mentioned that pulp removal was done under emergency there are more chances of remnants of pulp along with bugs to be left behind in the roots inside. in your first visit most of the pulp and pus should have been removed and that is why you got no pain until now. the maximum time usually allowed to start up root canal preparation is four weeks but it does not mean that you will lose the tooth waiting long. however it is best when the treatment is finished in short time frame unless it is medicated in the case of severe infections. there are high chances of root canal treatment attempted tooth when left untreated to get broken down because of no strength and no proper protection such as a cap. hence i advise you to get your next appointment as soon as possible and go ahead with the treatment plan. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I recently had an extirpation of pulp as an emergency on one of my teeth.

ear ringing and fatigue. i started amoxicillin the next day and the sinus pressure went away but the rest of my symptoms remained and i was absolutely miserable. i stayed on the antibiotic for four more days with no improvement - in fact i lost my voice around this time. i went back to the doctor and started levaquin. i was on that for four more days with no improvement and actually started coughing up/blowing my nose and producing this unnatural bright solid yellow mucous. i've seen much mucous in my day i'm a nurse. i've never seen mucous this color. it wasn't a seethrough yellow it was a solid bright yellow and when i blew my nose i could feel it pulling out of my sinuses by my nose. it was miserable and i could hardly breathe. at this point i went to the hospital where they gave me hour long breathing treatments solumedrol iv and put me on omnicef (another antibiotic). after a full week of this antibiotic i finished it. now (two/three weeks later) my mucous is clear/red (from all the irritation) i still have laryngitis (no voice) coughing from the tickle deep in my chest apparently have asthma now new symptoms last 4 days i've had joint pain and am seriously dizzy. i shouldn't be getting worse should i? i mean for crying out loud i quit smoking 4 weeks ago i'm using daily breathing treatments of albuterol ventolin inhaler as needed. i'm so exhausted that i just want to go to sleep and not wake up. what is going on? why am i not better? i've been to the doc 3 times and the er twice. they say there's nothing they can do for me but i'm concerned that something more serious is wrong. i'm scheduling an appointment for the ent doctor but around here physicians are really. lets just say i want an opinion from this online community before i go. please please please give me opinions?	i've been sick for 6 weeks with what the doctors say is a viral infection but i'm getting worse not better. normal? . it started with normal cold like symptoms which was ok. i made it through about two weeks of that just fine and was getting better. i was late picking up my narcolepsy medications (aderrall) and went through about 3 days of withdrawal which i'm sure made my immune system crash. i got my medication back but became seriously ill with what the doctors told me was a sinus infection. i concur. severe sinus pressure hacking wet cough dyspnea . . . to be continued

well that's kind of weird isn't it? i'm sorry you're going through this. the shoulder and arm area is an odd place to get a rash or a breakout of something like atopic dermatitis. if the rash is happening only on one side it's probably worth having a health care provider look at it though it's probably not any sort of emergency. if the rash is occurring on both shoulders/arms then you might consider causes such as laundry detergent (mild allergy or reaction) dryer sheets wearing new clothes before washing them a change in the type of soap you use (again possibly a mild allergic reaction) or something along those lines. if the rash/blotchiness doesn't clear up on its own or if it gets worse spreads or your begin having swelling of the face/mouth and/or shortness of breath then you need to seek medical care. best wishes as you try to solve this mystery!	i have skin redness/scratchlike rashes around my shoulder and arm area not from scratching but it looks just like it. . it does not itch. no bumps or soarness. just red scratch like rashes and blotchy arm redness.

most helpful answer not having a fallopian tube can indeed decrease your chances of getting pregnant. assuming your right ovary is still working the lack of a fallopian tube on that side means any egg put out by the ovary has nowhere to go. that means you can only get pregnant when your left ovary is putting out an egg. obviously you can't control which ovary puts out an egg in any given month. your best bet is to consult your gynecologist for specific information about your case. he or she may be able to refer you to an infertility specialist for some kind of treatment. i wish you all the best!	i'm trying to get pregnant from last 3 months. i dont have right felopian tube does it affect to get pregnant? wt do i do?

"hi my friend studies have shown a very strong correlation between a lack of physical activity and the development of anxiety disorders. this relationship isn't entirely clear but many of the proposed causes of this include: unused energy – one of the most frequently cited reasons for anxiety is unused energy. your body was made to move and unfortunately when it doesn't move it creates tension. we see this actually with dogs often – dogs that don't get their daily walks often become anxious and high strung because if they don't work out their energy that energy turns first into physical tension and then into mental tension. increased stress hormone – when you feel stress your body releases a hormone known as cortisol. there's evidence that movement is what depletes cortisol bringing it back to normal levels. this makes sense because anxiety itself is the ""fight or flight"" system. when your body experiences it it expects you to fight or flight. inactivity is essentially doing nothing and that may cause your body to start misfiring your stress and anxiety hormones. immune system malfunction – exercise is also necessary for a regulated immune system as well as maintaining a healthy hormone balance. there's reason to believe that inactivity prevents these important things from occurring. there may also be secondary components as well. those that are often inactive are also often enjoying less experiences and positive experiences are good for anxiety. those that aren't working to improve their health may develop small problems that create anxiety on their own. these may all be contributing factors. so please go ahead with your plan for exercising! good luck on everything! dhammika abeygoonawardhane sri lanka"	i am full time college student want to lose some weight been having anxiety attacks. is it still okay to exercise? . when i told my parents about it my mom asked me if i am getting enough air through my ribs. i did not know. . . the best discriptions to descripe what i was feeling is that it felt like my ribs are crushing in me. . . i am way over weight and want to have a better lifestyle and start exercising. . i am wondering if it would be okay to exercise consider my past with anxiety attacks. . . my record of anxiety attacks counts as 4 or 5 from august to december
most helpful answer see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. you may not know the reason(s) you are crying and not feeling well but a medical provider would likely have more insight. this complicated matter cannot be solved blindly over the internet so please do the right thing and see a medical professional.	18 years old crying for no reason i'm sick. this morning i woke up to take a shower and there was no hot water so i started crying? i also have a headache and i feel like throwing up. this has happened the last couple of sundays at work. i always feel this way in the morning when i do feel it. on top of that i've had a stuffy nose and bad cough for 4 weeks. it's gotten better but it won't go away. and my ears are clogged. then last night i notice that certain smells get me light headed.

if she is in her ovulation period then better to take an emergency contraceptive pill. ovulation occurs 14 days prior to the expected menses. imagine her periods is of 28 days then unsafe days are from 11th day of menses to 20th day. ovulation is unpredictable as the cycles of menses. so such a long unsafe period for extra safety. if you had sex before 11 days and after 20 days of first menstrual day then chances of pregnancy are very less. you need not take i-pill. if not then take i-pill at the earliest. for further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I had unprotected intercourse this morning.

or. call the doctor again. i am not sure of the reason for the antibiotic if the strep test was negative. that usually indicates a virus and viruses (including mono) do not respond at all to any antibiotic. the reason for the continue fever may also indicate that an antibiotic may have been unnecessary but of course i wasn't there and can't see his throat. with that said if he is in pain not swallowing having another examination is prudent. he could still have mono since some early tests are false negative and not as accurate. 48hrs is recommended [ for adults in good health] if fever is over 103 or greater er would be suggested if ibuprofen is not reducing fever? drink lots of fluids high temps can dehydrate you and that can cause fevers to	on antibiotics for over 24hrs. fever wont go below 100. er trip? . went to dr and was tested for mono and strep. both came back negative. pain in ear and throat are making it difficult to swallow. been taking ibuprofen 800 and cold medicine but the fever will not break. when should we head to the emergency room?
even in people with chronic hepatitis b the immune system is working to suppress the virus. medications that suppress the immune system allow the virus to reproduce in large numbers and may cause the hepatitis to flare. examples of medications that suppress the immune system are: prednisone: used to treat many diseases including asthma inflammatory bowel disease and certain types of skin disease and arthritis. methotrexate (rheumatrex trexall): used to treat certain types of skin disease arthritis and cancer. cyclophosphamide (cytoxan): used to treat some cancers. if an immunosuppressant drug is stopped the body's immune system's activity may rebound and cause severe inflammation of the liver.	what are the effects of immunosuppressive medications on hepatitis b virus?

no you can safely sleep with commercial earplugs. homemade ones perhaps not. earplugs made with a wad of cotton can become trapped in the ear but those inexpensive foam ones designed to block ambient noise are fine to use. have a good night's sleep. as long as the ear plugs are well fitted to your ears you should be fine. you obviously don't want them to be able to get inside the ear canal where they could be difficult to remove.	is it dangerous to sleep with ear plugs in?
i had an extremely high metabolic rate and was an athlete competing in martial arts. i had to gain weight to compete with stronger opponents in a heavier weight class. let's keep it simple 3 key elements will allow you to gain muscle mass/weight. 1. rest - get two days/week of rest to recover from training. you grow when you're resting. you can split up the 2 days or have it simultaneously. take it easy on those days and don't do anything too physical. 2. train - lift heavy weights with low reps for 1 1/2 hour and then do another 30 min of plyometrics. next day do it in reverse. repeat this cycle throughout the week. if you're an athlete you'll need to extend training time up to 3 hrs in one day. when running do sprints. do high impact high intensity exericises. do not perform long-distance endurance training. if you have to run don't go over 3 miles. 3. eat - consume a lot of carbs from veggies and fruits. 3/4 of your meal should be carbs to give you energy and pack on necessary fat. 1/4 of your meal should be protein to build muscle. contrary to popular beliefs you need plenty of fat storage in order for the body to be healthy and build muscle. consuming protein volume based on your body weight is not accurate for everyone some bodies will not utilize extra protein. you want that carb for energy to push harder and grow bigger/stronger. eat pasta rice and potatos with every meal. you will bulk up in size/strength adding 10 lbs of muscle like me within a month. if you get too bulky and need to trim down to make weight for athletic competition then reverse the diet eat more protein and less carbs. always drink a ton of water! find people with similar goals to train with! it's not just about building your body it's also about building a community. good luck!	i have a very high metabolism and i can't gain weight. how can i lower my metabolism while exercising more? . i'm 20 years old 6' tall and weigh only about 150-155. i'm also not very active. i want to start running and lifting weights but it's tough for me to gain muscle because i have a very hard time putting on weight. what can i do to lower my metabolism enough to start putting on weight and getting bigger? i also don't eat very well but tend to eat a descent amount of protein every day.

we have a patient here who has two very serious medical conditions; diabetes and high blood pressure. most likely too as a pharmacist i am going to ask on what medications they're on and i guarantee they're on quite a few. with acai berry we don't have any data on whether or not it interacts with medications and when you have something like cardiovascular disease and diabetes it's probably better to be safe than sorry. we have patients who end up taking these products because they think that they're natural and they're safe and they're not going to do anything. well most cases end up in the emergency room.	is it okay to take acai berry while having diabetes and high blood pressure?

dry skin is a frustrating condition and winter makes it even worse. if you have a moisturizer that does not burn then you should stick with that. here are a few more dry skin tips for winter: * take warm showers not hot. when possible rinse in cooler water. this helps your skin to not over-respond to the hot water by becoming more dry and red. * after showering washing your face or hands be sure to dry your skin completely with a dry towel. i'm not sure why this is but we tend to only partially dry our hands during the winter and this will contribute to the development of really dry skin that is prone to cracking and breaking. * use a humidifier in your room. winter air is dry and your skin suffers from this. raising the humidity in your home will help your overall symptoms. * obviously you want to stay well hydrated so drink plenty of water and water-containing beverages eat fruit and vegetables. stay away from caffeine and alcohol because they dehydrate you.	last winter my skin started to get excessively dry and crack overnight. this year it's back. what can i do?
i have delt with bi-polar disorder my entire life. my mom was severely bi-polar and i was diagnosed at age 13. my mother attempted suicide over 50 times. i have one brother and two sisters who refused to deal with my mom due to the fact they thought her suicide attempts were just ways to get attention. my mother passed away in 2005. non-suicide. so now i am basically on my own with this disorder as my siblings not really wanting to have anything to do with me because they couldn't deal with my mothers bi-polar. i realize this is off topic but i would like to thank kymi84 for her earlier response. i experience alot of the same symptoms she does and until i read her response i thought it was just me. thanks for being so open and honest. as far as the main topic the illnesses or other symptoms you might have due to your bi-polar vary from person to person. aches pains headaches migraine. the list can go on and on.	what illnesses often co-exist with bipolar disorder?
you have mentioned numbness in the inner part of the left foot as your main symptom. most commonly numbness is a manifestation of a nerve involvement it can be compression of the nerve at an anatomical site like in back or anywhere along the course of the nerve or it may be a manifestation of a systemic disease like diabetes or any condition that leads to what we call as neuropathy. now your trigger has been the yoga courses which you do on a regular basis every year but you have done may be for a prolonged period this year. being an orthopaedic surgeon i may not be able to guide you anything regarding yoga and its usefulness but it is logical to stop all these postures till your condition settles and improves. my guess is that there has been some prolonged compression during your classes or there could be an entrapment somewhere along the course of your nerve. i need to know from you: whether you have any back pain? is there any radiating pain from the spine region all along the course of your limb? apart from numbness are there any other symptoms of neurological involvement like weakness paresthesias burning sensations etc. also present? if the answers to above questions are no my suggestion to you will be to wait for a few days and start with medications for neuropathic symptoms like pregabalin or gabapentin along with vitamin b 12 supplementation and it is a good possibility that your symptoms may subside over next 4-6 weeks because there might be nerve neuropraxia (mid nerve injury). in case your symptoms do not improve or if they increase then i suggest you to get few blood tests done and nerve conduction studies to look for any compressive pathology. get back to an orthopaedician and traumatologist online for further queries --> <link>	Hello Doctor,I am a 39 year old male. My height is 6 feet and I weigh 81 kg. Right side of my left foot is having numbness though it is not 100% numb. The left side of the foot has little pain. I get a feeling that there is some blockage in the blood flow though it might not be the case.I am a regular vipassana meditator and I have been going to 10 day courses regularly for the past 6 years. This time I decided to do a 30 day course. This numbness started happening on the 10th day and continued for 20 more days. A typical vipassana requires sitting for 13-14 hours with small breaks at regular intervals. I thought I will get better once I start doing activity after coming back home (though I used to walk for 15-20 minutes daily during the course also). I never had such problem in the past courses. There was no improvement in the condition even after 15 days after coming back. I have done alternate hot and cold water treatment but did not see any improvement. I also tried doing massage using rheumatic oil.  In case it helps, my family has had cases of diabetics (my grandmother and my father's brothers). What would you recommend?

"losing weight is a challenge. although it seems that you're doing every right your body thinks that it's being starved and goes into a metabolic slowdown. i suggest the ""weight watchers"" website as a good place to start your dieting process anew. their website has meal planning and dieting hints. the cost to join is reasonable and all tasks necessary to be successful can be accomplished on-line. their foods are available in most larger supermarkets and have literally hundreds of food choices. weight watchers has a point system assigned to different foods which makes even dining out in restaurants possible. books new and used are available on- line for weight watcher (including books that detail point values for many foods) to ensure that you're following the program correctly. i have no personal interest in weight watchers except to share the best dieting information that is available. of all the major diet plans weight watchers consistently has the highest satisfaction ratings. even my doctor whom i have known for 25 years recommends weight watchers to his patients. as far as pills and medications go most seem to be just fads that ultimately fail the dieting individual. one newer supplement garcinia cambogia shows some promising results from anecdotal accountings by its users. - your exercise time seems to acceptable for weight loss and ultimate weight maintenance. i would obtain some information on exercising to lose weight through books and pamphlets available on - line. even though you're investing what appears to be the correct time to exercising it is important to do the exercises that will work best for your dieting objectives. walking is a great way to burn calories. walking also has the additional benefits of viewing spring flowers the sky and the birds. don't forget to stop and talk with the neighbors. it is therapeutic to forge new friendships that will support your dieting program. - my first step before starting any dieting program would be to receive medical clearance and recommendations from my doctor. - you may also consider joining a support group to bolster your knowledge about dieting and hear success stories from other people just like us that lost weight. it can be done."

crohn's disease cannot be prevented because the cause is unknown. but you can take steps to reduce the severity of the disease. medicines taken regularly may reduce sudden (acute) attacks and keep the disease in remission (a period without symptoms). most experts recommend acetaminophen ( tylenol for example) for pain relief rather than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. nsaids have been linked to flare-ups. 3 do not smoke. smoking makes crohn's disease worse. eat a healthy diet. never use antibiotics unless they have been prescribed for you by a doctor. get regular exercise. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	how can crohns disease be prevented?

plaques from atherosclerosis can: stay within the artery wall. there the plaque grows then stops. they don't block blood flow so may never cause symptoms. grow in a slow controlled way into the path of blood flow. eventually they cause significant blockages. pain on exertion (in the chest or legs) is the usual symptom. in the worst case they can suddenly rupture allowing blood to clot inside an artery. in the brain this causes a stroke; in the heart a heart attack. the plaques cause three kinds of cardiovascular disease: coronary artery disease: stable plaques in the heart's arteries cause angina (chest pain on exertion). sudden plaque rupture and clotting causes heart muscle to die. this is a heart attack or myocardial infarction. cerebrovascular disease: ruptured plaques in the brain's arteries causes strokes with potential for permanent brain damage. temporary artery blockages can also cause transient ischemic attacks (tias) warning signs of stroke; however there is no brain injury. peripheral artery disease: narrowing in the arteries of the legs caused by plaque. that causes poor circulation pain on walking and poor wound healing. severe disease may lead to amputations.	how does atherosclerosis damage the cardiovascular system?

it's possible yes. if you get your insurance at work the affordable care act does require that young adults up to the age of 26 remain covered. however your company may not be required to cover maternity. though maternity coverage is part of the essential health benefits that individual and small business plans must cover many large employers are exempt from having to comply with this part of the law for dependents.	can my health insurance deny maternal/prenatal care to my dependent if the coverage started in january of 2014?

unfortunately retiree health insurance plans are exempt from a number of affordable care act provisions including limits on annual and lifetime payouts. unlike with an offer of affordable employee health however as a retiree younger than age 65 you are eligible to shop for coverage through the exchanges set up under the law. and if your income qualifies you may be able to get financial help to lower the cost of your plan. it's worth checking out your options now during open enrollment at healthcare. gov. none of the plans sold there are allowed to impose lifetime or annual limits and they offer a host of other protections your retiree plan may not. you have until february 15 2015 to sign up for a plan for next year.	i will get retiree insurance in 2015 that has a $100 000 lifetime limit is this legal? . i will get retiree insurance in 2015 that has a $100 000 lifetime limit and a $7 500 lifetime prescription limit is this legal?

you will probably be just fine. hand-washing and intact skin (on your hands) is an excellent defense against the transmission of viruses. that was a nice act of kindness (the money not the lighter). it would be highly highly unlikely that this brief touching of the hands would result in you contracting any disease. don't be bummed out (pun intended).	can you kill an uncaught hepes viruse by washing your hands? . i was walking in town today and there was a bum at the gas station very dirty and it look as though he had oral herpes. he asked for change so i gave him some plus my lighter our hands touched briefly so i went home and washed my hands. i don't want to give herpes to my fiancé so i'm a little skittish about sex now.
carbon monoxide poisoning happens when you breathe too much carbon monoxide. carbon monoxide is a gas produced by burning any type of fuel-gas oil kerosene wood or charcoal. what makes carbon monoxide so dangerous is that when you breathe it it replaces the oxygen in your blood. without oxygen cells throughout the body die and the organs stop working. you can't see smell or taste carbon monoxide. but if you breathe too much of it it can become deadly within minutes. so it’s very important to know the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning what to do if you have the symptoms and how to keep it from happening. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what is carbon monoxide poisoning?
"sorry you're going through this. it may as your pediatrician says be entirely normal for your child to sleep so little but it's obviously disturbing for you. one thing you can do to help your child develop good sleep habits is to maintain an evening routine. this is called ""sleep hygiene. "" you can approach sleep hygiene in different ways but a few things i'd suggest are: stop water intake an hour or so before bedtime avoid letting your child drink any caffeinated beverages after noon (this includes ice tea soda etc. ) go to bed at the same time each night don't use the bed for anything but sleeping (except to read a bedtime book or something) if your child has not gone off to sleepland within 30 minutes of going to bed allow your child to get up and read or enjoy some other quiet relaxing activity try going back to bed again make sure your child is getting plenty of exercise during the day if your child doesn't seem to have symptoms related to lack of sleep try not to worry too much. every person has different sleep needs and our sleep requirements vary with age. by the time she's a teenager you'll be asking for advice on how to get her out of bed before noon! good luck to you!"	what can i do to help my four year old sleep. my four year old has never slept more then five hours a night. i've tried having light dinners and she never was slept with any object. her doctor just tells me it is natural for some kids but i'm still worried

shortness of breath is an early symptom seen in congestive heart failure patients. swollen ankles and feet is a more serious symptom and may be evidenced by swollen extremities (especially the ankles) and by weight gain. i have known some congestive heart failure victims to gain as much as fifteen pounds in one day. one individual in particular stands out in my mind. she was much younger than 85 years old and took lasix (diuretic) every day to release excess fluid. when swollen extremities and weight gain of at least seven pounds occurred metolazone (known as the turbo pill) was added to the daily regimen for a very short period of time until the acute water build up was under control. although gaining six pounds of weight in two weeks is not in itself a medical crisis it is a sign of fluid retention and justifies being assessed in person by a physician. being 85 years old with overt congestive heart failure symptoms puts this person in a potentially life threatening situation. despite the upsetting emotions that a trip to the e. r. may evoke in this person it is better to be safe than sorry. i suggest that you phone her physician first and then take this person to the hospital for treatment. best wishes for this lady's speedy recovery.	swollen feet and shortness of breath are new symptoms of a 85 yr old who has congestive heart failure. however her oxygen levels are 100%. she has gained 6 pds over the last two weeks and has difficulty eating. we were advised by her physician to observe her (she has a pending appt nxt wk) and she has been taken her medication regularly and has strictly followed her diet. . should this warrant a visit to the e/r? i am trying to avoid additional stress on her since she has alzheimer's and dementia and the goings to the hospital get her confused and she comes back home more fragile than ever.
thank you for your question on ehealthforum. com dysmenorrhea (pain during periods) associated with back ache is common in some women especially young women in their initial years of sexual life. meningitis can produce headache due to interference with cerebrospinal fluid circulation by altering the intracranial pressures. if your meningitis was uncomplicated with no csf blockage it is unlikely to cause any problems. neurological examination will help in identifying any sequelae of meningitis suffered earlier. eye examination will show signs of increased intracranial pressure like optic disc edema. in an instance of raised intracranial pressure person suffers from headache (chronic) visual disturbance and even loss apart from other neurological symptoms depending on pressure related damage. if you do not have any of those mentioned than it is very unlikely that you have any symptoms related to meningitis sequelae. thank you.	i had melingtis when i was a baby and i was wondering if there are any effects that i could have 18yrs on? i also suffer with really bad back pain when it is the time of the month. i was wondering if you can help me?
you can see a rebound weight gain with any of the stimulants but it really happens for a short time and doesn't usually continue indefinitely. on the other hand we have seen compulsive binge eating in those with untreated adhd. eating disorders are common in adhd and are the result of untreated symptoms of impulsivity and distractibility. stimulants not only decrease appetite but also decrease the urge to binge in these cases.	i took adderall for nine years but quit because of the side effects. now i'm gaining weight like crazy. what can i do?

calorie needs are individual and depend on age gender lean body mass and your level of activity. since you are not overweight i wonder why you count calories at all. it seems to me if you eat well balanced regular meals and let hunger and fullness guide your eating you will get the right amount for your body type. emerging research shows that young adults who eat this way (often called intuitive or mindful eating) have lower bmis -- and disordered eating -- then those who don't. it may be that you started counting calories to lose weight 5 years ago. but i say ditch the calorie counting and learn how to trust and nourish your body instead. read more. healthy eating: recognize your hunger signals	"i eat 1 200-1 500 calories a day. is that enough? . i'm 19 5""3' female and weigh 120. for the past at least five years of my life i've been eating 1 200-1 500 calories which leaves me feeling satisfied energized and maintaining my weight. i've been eating a very healthy vegan diet and have eaten pretty healthy my whole life. i feel like i'm eating enough and i'm maintaining my weight but our ""experts"" say i need to eat more. i feel like if i ate more i would just gain weight but i'm at a healthy weight now. i exercise moderately."

"do you wonder whether disposable incontinence supplies are cheaper in the long run than reusable types? do you worry about putting all of those disposable items into the environment? if you are using incontinence products of any kind (pads adult diapers undergarments etc. ) you need to evaluate the types of products available based on what is most important to you — convenience or economy. there is no research to tell you which type of product is better for the skin. disposable products are convenient. purchased in quantity they can be always available when needed and require no labor other than putting them on. underwear and pads come in a wide range of sizes (waist extenders are available for some briefs) and they all are available in light medium and heavy protection levels. disposable incontinence products are more expensive than washable products in general and can cost anywhere from $200 to $400 per month depending on the amount of urine loss. this is a large expense for a person on a fixed income. some people are forced to make their own homemade pads from tissue paper towels and other materials. unfortunately medicare hmos and insurance companies don't tend to cover the cost of absorbent products and their disposal adds to environmental pollution. at the same time reusable products may not be as ""skin friendly"" as disposable ones. washable/reusable products are economical. studies have shown that some washable pads are equivalent in cost to 100 disposable pads of the same absorbency. washable underwear is available in basic styles in styles that mimic regular underwear and in styles that are elegant and indistinguishable from fine lingerie. if you are caring for someone who needs many underwear or pad changes daily the labor of washing these products is a factor to consider. incontinence garments (sometimes called adult diapers) that are washable usually have an outer layer of plastic rubber or synthetic material for protection and can be pulled up snapped on the side or open down the front. they are usually less expensive to use over time than disposable garments. because of their waterproof outer layer many women find washable garments uncomfortable because they don't ""breathe"". such women often prefer cotton underwear with a perineal pad in the crotch to collect urine leakage."	how should i choose incontinence products?

birth control pills are out of your system in a day or two after you stop taking them – which is why you need to take them every single day in order for them to be effective. the injectable forms of birth control such as depo-provera are designed to provide contraception for three months. but it can take up to nine or 10 months to be completely dispelled. after three months since your last injection this form of birth control can no longer be guaranteed as an effective contraceptive.	how long does it take for hormonal birth control (pills or injections) to leave your system once you stop using them?
people vary in their reactions to mosquito bites. most people develop itchy raised bumps on the skin that last several days. no treatment is necessary but calamine lotion or over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream can reduce itching. a few people have a significant allergy to mosquito bites. the bites can result in what’s called a large local reaction: swelling blistering itching and pain affecting a wide area of the body (such as an entire arm or leg). oral antihistamines like cetirizine (zyrtec) diphenhydramine (benadryl) or hydroxyzine (atarax vistaril) can help ease itching. topical hydrocortisone may also help. rarely people with a severe allergy to mosquito bites develop anaphylaxis a whole-body life-threatening allergic reaction. symptoms of anaphylaxis include: • itching or rash especially hives in areas of skin away from the bite. • hoarseness or shortness of breath. • lightheadedness. anaphylaxis requires emergency medical attention. people who have had anaphylaxis-like symptoms previously should always have injectable epinephrine (an epi-pen) nearby. antiseptic will help get rid of the pain from the bite. antihistamine cream or lotions will help to keep any reactions to that bite away (best to go to doctors or take precautional measures either using epipen e. t. c. if you do have allergic reactions) i would sugest to go to the doctor straight away telling him its urgent if you have any of these symptons: fever rash joint pain or conjunctivitis muscle pains or headaches especially if the bite hole gets enlargens. shaking chills that can range from moderate to severe. high fever. profuse sweating. headache. nausea. vomiting. diarrhea. anemia. thank you for asking.	how do i treat mosquito bites?

tsh is thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. tsh stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormone into the blood. thyroid hormone maintains normal metabolism growth body temperature and many other essential bodily functions. blood levels of tsh and thyroid hormone are maintained in a tight balance. high levels of thyroid hormone cause the pituitary to reduce the release of tsh. low levels of tsh lead the pituitary to release more tsh. this in turn stimulates the thyroid gland which produces more thyroid hormone which reduces the tsh level. this relationship is called a negative feedback loop. doctors use the blood tsh level as a screening blood test for thyroid function: high tsh usually means an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). low tsh is usually due to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). in people being treated for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism tsh also provides information on the success of treatment.	what is tsh?

it's true that antioxidants will break down over time once you open it to the air. but they do have preservatives that help stabilize them to prevent that breakdown. if you start to see the color change of those products that's a sign that they are breaking down. keeping the jar closed tightly or keeping it in the refrigerator will help somewhat but i often find that when i keep something in the refrigerator i am too tired or lazy at the end of the day to go get it from there so i don't end up using it and then it does no good at all. so if you are very motivated and you will go to the refrigerator every time you want to use it that's fine. but chances are you will use that product up before it breaks down if you are using it enough so you don't have to worry about it.	i read that open jar packaging oxidizes the anti-aging ingredients in moisturizers. will it last longer in the fridge?

i know it's hard to justify when you get a new medication and it's expensive. but this medication might be the right medication and in the long run might actually save you money. this is a once-a-day medication it's used for depression. and if it helps you and it makes you feel better then that's a good price to pay. when you don't feel well with depression and you don't take these types of medications and you take some that have to be taken more frequently or might have more side-effects you forget to take them. therefore if there is a price on your quality of life and then also you are going to see the doctor more often which means that your overall healthcare costs are actually going up. so there are patient assistance programs available through the manufacturers patients may want to look into that as helping offset the cost of that medication. at the end of the day it might be the right fit.	my doctor has given me a really expensive medication pristiq. are there any ways to reduce those costs?

these bacteria are spread through direct contact with mucus from the nose or throat of persons who are infected or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. ill persons such as those who have strep throat or skin infections are most likely to spread the infection. persons who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. treating an infected person with an antibiotic for 24 hours or longer generally eliminates their ability to spread the bacteria. however it is important to complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. it is not likely that household items like plates cups or toys spread these bacteria.	how are group a streptococcal bacteria spread?
constipation is a common problem that pregnant women have. and there are some things that they can do to help ease the constipation. the first thing is to probably change their diet. i am sure it's not something that a pregnant mom wants to hear because they want to have certain foods but by increasing your fibre intake having more fruit juices fresh fruit more water. water is a great substance that can actually help you ease your constipation. a lot of times pregnant moms are dehydrated because of the fact that they are not drinking enough during the day. so by making these little changes it will help. some minimal exercise. walking around a little bit more actually does a lot of great in helping constipation. there are stool softeners that are available. the common product is docusate sodium and that can be used by pregnant women but i would definitely recommend as a pharmacist that a pregnant woman check with their ob/gyn or healthcare provider first before starting that type of therapy.	how can i deal with constipation during pregnancy?
hi here’s a list that may help you. many arrhythmias occur as a complication of a heart condition. for example ischaemic heart disease (which causes angina and heart attacks). this reduces the blood supply to parts of the heart which may include parts of the conducting system. a damaged section of heart muscle (following a heart attack) can trigger an arrhythmia or block electrical impulses. heart valve diseases can cause the heart muscle to enlarge which can trigger abnormal electrical activity. for example af is a common complication of mitral valve disease. high blood pressure can put strain on the heart and cause arrhythmias. age-related degeneration (ageing) around the conducting fibres is one cause of complete heart block. cardiomyopathy (a disorder of the heart muscle) can sometimes cause arrhythmias. some arrhythmias are due to abnormalities in the electrical pathways which are present from birth. one example is an extra electrical pathway which sometimes develops between the atria and ventricles. this can cause a type of svt. (however symptoms may not first start until you are a young adult. ) some congenital heart defects are associated with certain arrhythmias. inflammation of the heart and other less common heart disorders are other possible causes. your should find out that sex is not the bad fro what your asking a good orgasm does release some good things around our body’s as for exercise as long as its not to herd or fast you should be ok swimming would be good for you its gentle and less stressful and also low impact. hope this helps you. good luck	can arrhythmia be caused by extreme exercise or sexual activity?

1. be a good role model. if you want your child to eat healthfully exercise regularly and limit time in front of the tv or computer… start by doing these things yourself. 2. do a preconception visit. pre-pregnancy health affects your pregnancy and your growing baby. see your health practitioner before you are pregnant. aim for your ideal body weight (bmi) before pregnancy. 3. know your bmi. it stands for body mass index. and it tells you if you are at risk for health-related consequences of obesity. check yours and your child’s. make lifestyle changes if that number is too high. i know it is easier to say than to do. 4. trust yourself. you have the skills to be a good parent. really. 5. happy parents have happy children. take time for yourself and for your marriage. you’ll be amazed by the results. 6. vaccines are safe. they protect your child from diseases you don’t want her to have. seriously. get your child vaccinated. i wouldn’t do anything different with my own kids. 7. you are planting the seeds of discipline. do not expect a tree to grow overnight. it will take months or even years to see the results of your calm and consistent discipline techniques. don’t give up. 8. sleep is underrated. it rejuvenates the body and mind. make it a priority for you and your child. establish a healthy sleep routine and stick to it. let your baby self-soothe when he is old enough to do so (around 4-6 months of age). it’s a critical life skill. 9. it takes a family. you don’t have to do-it-all to win parent of the year. share responsibilities between your partner and your kids (as they become old enough to help out). remember happy parents have happy children. 10. floss.	what are your top ten parenting tips?

first you really need to sit down with your physician and his/her team and talk about how to manage your polycystic ovarian syndrome. some baseline labs will help direct you: fasting insulin level fasting blood glucose hgba1c and of course your testosterone. there are medications that can help if you have insulin resistance and have elevated blood glucose levels. metformin is one such medication you should discuss with your doctor. weight reduction is a challenge with pcos. you should go to the pcos association website and communicate with other kindred spirits for support and guidance. it is imperative that you are vigilant about your total carbohydrate intake each day as so many women with pcos have trouble metabolizing carb. try to keep your carb intake to about 150gr per day (as opposed to the common american with 400-600 gr/day) and avoid refined and processed sugars at all costs. stick with whole foods with an emphasis on lean protein and vegetables. combine that plan with cardio and weight training done with intensity intervals and you'll see weight reduction. just make sure you're coordinating with your medical team.	i have polycystic ovarian syndrome and gained 50 pounds despite regular exercise and healthy eating. what can i do?

the main line of treatment is with anti-epileptic drugs which are effective in controlling seizures in 70%-80% of patients with epilepsy. there are several anti-epileptic medications. since certain medications are much better for some seizures the choice of the medication should be made by a physician who is familiar with these medications. if possible the child should be evaluated in a center specializing in epilepsy. if this is not feasible usually pediatric neurologists have training in epileptic disorders and are a good source for a referral. when anti-epileptic drugs fail to control the seizures patients may improve with surgical procedures.	how is epilepsy treated?
it's true that for everybody your lips do flatten and become thinner over time. some people never have big lips and so they will notice it more and maybe at an earlier age. injections are one of the main ways to add volume back but for people who don't want volume that way there are some lip liners that you can use and some lip plumpers that help a little bit. most of these work by causing some irritation that increases blood supply that gives a temporary effect of fullness. for some people that works fine and otherwise it can be irritating. so there isn't that much that you can do. but you might be able to just work with a good lip gloss or a lip liner to add the appearance of volume. the other thing to think about is your teeth because your teeth is what supports your lip. if your teeth are in or pointing in or if you lose volume in terms of bone around the mouth that can also cause your lip to flatten and look thinner over time. so just getting something as simple as veneers can help invert your lip and give you great support of your lips and make a very big difference without doing any injections at all.	my lips seemed to be thinning as i get older. i don't want injections. are there other options for me?

1. taking the time to cook your family’s meals is probably the most important step to cutting back on the salt. processed and prepared foods usually contain substantially more salt than you’d ever add to your home prepared meals. 2. buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables. if you buy canned look for “no salt added” on the label. 3. choose alternate seasonings to flavor your food. if you use a seasoning blend select one that is salt-free. 4. be a label reader. salt will be listed as “sodium. ” select items that contain 5% of less of your daily salt intake. steer clear of food items that contain 20% or more of your daily salt intake! 5. look for hidden sources of salt: salad dressing canned soup/broth and packaged mixes. 6. love sushi? pick low-salt soy sauce (it usually has a green top). 7. avoid or limit high-salt meats - those that are smoked cured or processed. 8. don’t put the salt shaker on the kitchen table.	what are some ways i can cut back on my family's salt intake?

prenatal vitamins are very similar to multivitamins. the three elements that are most important for a prenatal vitamin are the amounts of folic acid iron and calcium. typically a prescription prenatal vitamin has more folic acid and/or iron than a nonprescription prenatal vitamin or a traditional multivitamin. it would not be dangerous for your daughter’s husband to take her prenatal vitamins by accident. depending on the product he may have consumed more of some daily vitamins and minerals than is necessary but as a one-time error this should not be harmful.	my daughter’s husband took prescription prenatal vitamins on accident. is this dangerous?

one can help to prevent atherosclerosis and reduce heart attack risks by: controlling high blood pressure and diabetes. never smoking or stopping cigarette smoking. exercising regularly. losing excess weight. lowering blood levels of ldl cholesterol. increasing blood levels of hdl cholesterol. lowering blood levels of lipoprotein a cholesterol and triglycerides. increasing ldl cholesterol particle sizes. taking antiplatelet medications (such as low dose aspirin) to prevent blood clots. consuming antioxidants to prevent blood vessel damage (however not scientifically proven to date). consuming folic acid and other b vitamins to decrease blood levels of homocysteine (however not scientifically proven to date). many of the measures that prevent coronary atherosclerosis also benefit other arteries such as carotid arteries and cerebral arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain). therefore these measures also prevent strokes.	how can coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks be prevented?
most helpful answer heating formula in the microwave will not destroy the nutrients but it is not recommended. the reason is it does not heat the milk evenly potentially resulting in milk that is hot in some areas and cold in others. a better way to warm up formula is by running it under warm water or placing it in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes. just make sure the bottle is not to hot when you give it to your baby. congratulations on your baby	does microwaving infant formula destroy all the nutrients? . my boyfriend and i have been microwaving the formula for a few seconds just enough to make it warm. i mostly breast feed but i have had problems producing enough milk so when we supplement with formula we microwave it. my mom says it kills all the nutrients i say i don't think it does but im not a doctor! please help. i want to know so that if it does kill the nutrients i can stop doing that and do it a different way that will benefit my child.
no. an itchy ear is likely to be a problem in the external ear canal not a healing eardrum. however the drainage from the rupture could have caused some inflammation resulting in some itching. keep things out of your ears especially q-tips. if you are a q-tip user removing the protective earwax can make you ears more prone to infections and yes. itching. until your eardrum is totally healed it is not a good idea to get water in it either.	is an itchy ear a sign of my eardrum healing? . i was diagnosed with a ear infection and given amoxicillin to treat it. the nexy day my eardrum ruptured and a clear yet somewhat bloody fluid drained from my ear. my ear has been a little itchy and it gives me these twitches every once in a while. by the way i'm 15.

for the majority of children suffering hair loss one of the following conditions is the cause. your child's pediatrician or a pediatric dermatologist should be able to diagnose these conditions and prescribe the appropriate treatment. tinea capitis. tinea capitis commonly known as ringworm of the scalp is a fungal infection often seen in children. it can show up in a number of ways but often as scaly patches of hair loss on the head. the patches are usually round or oval. the hairs may be broken off at the surface of the skin and look like black dots on the scalp. because ringworm is contagious your child should be careful not to share any objects that touch the head such as hats pillow cases or brushes. alopecia areata. alopecia areata is a non-contagious condition of hair loss thought to be caused by the body's immune system attacking the hair follicles. it is characterized by the sudden appearance of round or oval patches of hair loss. the patches are slick or smooth without scaling or broken hairs. about 25% of children also have pitting and ridging of the nails. while there is no cure for alopecia areata treatment can control the disease in some children. many have their hair back within a year although regrowth is unpredictable and many will lose hair again. for about 5% of children the disease progresses to alopecia totalis -- loss of all of the hair on the scalp. some of these will develop alopecia universalis -- a total loss of body hair. trichotillomania. trichotillomania is hair loss caused by pulling plucking twisting or rubbing. the hair loss is patchy and characterized by broken hairs of varying length. patches are typically seen on the side of the child's dominant hand. trichotillomania may be triggered by a stressor in your child's life such as the loss of a grandparent birth of a sibling or a divorce. if you notice your child pulling hair scolding will not likely be helpful. however counseling to help your child deal with the source of stress that triggered the habit may help stop it. telogen effluvium. telogen effluvium is a condition in which a sudden or severe stress -- such as extremely high fever surgery under general anesthesia the death of a loved one a severe injury or the use of certain prescription medications -- interrupts the normal cycle of hair growth. the hair follicles stop growing prematurely and enter a resting phase (called the telogen phase). between six and 16 weeks later hair sheds excessively leading to partial or complete baldness. there are no conclusive tests to diagnose telogen effluvium; there is also no treatment for it. however once the stressful event is over full hair growth usually returns within six months to a year. nutritional deficiency. though less common hair loss can be a symptom of deficiencies in certain nutrients including: vitamin h or biotin one of the b complex of vitamins which help the body to convert carbohydrates into glucose to fuel the body. zinc an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism. it also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy childhood and adolescence. in some cases hair loss can be a symptom of too much vitamin a. with a healthy varied diet most children will not experience nutritional deficiencies that lead to hair loss. however if you suspect a problem speak to your child's doctor before giving nutritional supplements. endocrine problems. in some children the cause of hair loss is hypothyroidism a condition in which the thyroid is underactive and is producing an insufficient amount of thyroid hormones required for regulating metabolism. a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is made by a blood test and possibly a scan of the thyroid gland.	what are the medical causes of hair loss in children?

simply put the cigarette smoke attracts inflammatory cells (white blood cells including neutrophils lymphocytes and macrophages) into the lung. then the inflammatory cells release substances called proteases. the proteases dissolve the proteins in the alveolar walls (septae) and thereby destroy the septae. as a result the alveoli join together (coalesce) to form the larger irregular inefficient air sacs. it turns out that about half of all smokers develop emphysema. mild emphysema is seen occasionally in non-smokers and may be due to passive smoking (exposure to other people smoking) and industrial air pollution. severe emphysema however is seen only in smokers or in some people with rare inherited diseases (e. g. alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency). still it takes about 30 years of smoking to develop fatal emphysema. this is because people usually don't die from emphysema until more than 60% of the lung tissue is affected.	how does emphysema happen?

you don't make new hair follicle so you won't have more hair growing back. however as the hair grows back in the tip has a different shape so it feels coarser. as that hair grows in over time the ends become a little bit more tapered down and softer so it will go back to normal the way it was before you shaved. it can be darker. because over time as that hair fades as it settles on your skin and things rub against it or even as sunlight hits it it can fade and become lighter. so it may appear darker but not darker than it would have been -- than your natural hair color. so it won't be darker than it would have been at baseline. there are lots of ways to get rid of your arm hair. if you want a more permanent solution you should use a permanent hair removal system like dm6000 pro kit. it is affordable and really does the job. there are lots of these products on the market you don't have to get expensive service done and best yet you can use a product like this for other parts of your body and for other family members.	if i shave my face or lower arms will the hair grow back in darker or coarser?

it sounds like you may have had some kind of allergic reaction to an ingredient in the shampoo. normally when someone uses a product and develops symptoms that go away when they stop using the product it means an ingredient in the product was the cause of their symptoms. it may not have been the keratin at all. shampoos contain a wide variety of ingredients from perfumes to dyes. it's possible your scalp really didn't like one of the components of that particular shampoo's formula. all that said i admit i don't know anything about keratin treatments specifically. however i certainly would be hesitant to undergo any treatment with a reputation for making people's hair fall out! take care!	why would keratin shampoo make my hair fall out? as soon as i quit using it it stopped. . i would like to get a keratin smoothing treatment but i've read similar stories where people lost their hair to the point of having bald spots. breakage i could understand but my hair fell out at the root. it doesn't make any sense.

first off you want to check for signs of dehydration including fewer wet diapers less play sunken eyes sunken fontanelle (soft spot on baby's head) loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. the fact that your baby isn't eating enough for adequate growth is another consideration. six months is also the time to start solids which is important for development and nutrition. this webmd article discusses various causes of diarrhea in babies. i would contact your doctor to find out if he or she wants you to come back in or get referred to a gastroenterologist. i think your gut is saying something isn't right -- and that is very important in my book. there may be a chance that your baby is intolerant to lactose. i would take her to the doctor and demand action. for the moment you could feed your baby cooled boiled water to ensure that she is receiving enough fluid the body can cope better without food than it can without fluid. i hope you find this useful and i hope your baby feels better soon.	my 6mth old weighs only 12. 8 lbs and has had diarrhea for 3 weeks what tests could be done to help determine the cause. after the first week i took her to the doctor and they diagnosed her with ear infections. she started augmentin a week later i took her back because she was still having diarrhea and loss of apetite and fevers ranging from 99. 0 - 102. 7 rectally. her wbc was 9. 5 and they said it was probably a virus. now another week has passed and she isn't better. no fevers that i have noticed but she is having watery bowel movements about 6 times a day and is only eating about 16 oz of formula a day.
home treatment for hair loss includes hair care and hairstyling techniques that may help you cover thinning or bald spots on the scalp. this may be easier for women because inherited hair loss ( androgenetic alopecia ) causes a general thinning that is usually not as severe as it is in men. hair sprays dyes and perms can help make the hair appear fuller. in women with inherited hair loss hair care and the occasional use of grooming products hair sprays hair color teasing permanents or frequent washing will not increase hair loss. but if your hair loss is caused by hair care then perms and dyes may contribute to more hair loss. for both men and women hair thinning and baldness increase the risk of sunburn and skin cancer on the scalp. when in the sun wear a hat or use a sunscreen with an spf of 30 or more to prevent sun damage to the scalp. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what can i do to treat hair loss at home?

no one knows what causes brain tumors; there are only a few known risk factors that have been established by research. people who receive radiation therapy to the head as a child have a higher risk of a brain tumor over the next 20 to 30 years. people who have certain rare genetic conditions such as neurofibromatosis -- a disorder of the nervous system -- or li-fraumeni syndrome -- a condition that predisposes someone to developing cancer -- are also at higher risk. but radiation therapy or rare genetic disorders are only a factor in a small number of the approximately 35 000 new primary brain tumors diagnosed each year. finally age is a factor. the rate of developing brain cancer is four times the rate each year in people over the age of 65 than in people younger than 65.	what causes brain tumors?

you seem to have a smart pa. general anesthesia is very shocking to the body. here are the suspected reason for hair loss after receiving general anesthesia: hair growth is dependent on cell division which is interfered with while under general anesthesia. without the necessary and required frequent cell division hair follicles lack the nutrients necessary for production; additionally while under anesthesia for longer periods of time the patient's head may be in a fixed position causing pressure and reducing blood supply to hair follicles; thirdly blood loss during surgery causes the body to divert blood to vital organs while reducing it to more non-essential areas such as hair follicles; the good news is that normal hair growth should be restored within 3 months of surgery.	does anesthesia cause hair loss? . i had cervical spine surgery from the back. and after surgery my hair started to fall out. not clumps but all over. mt pa said it could be from he anesthesia. if so how long does this last? . thanks

there are many causes for itchy scalps but dry skin would be high on the list as well as chemical sensitivity reactions (to shampoo) fungal scalp infections and yes even head lice. it is not possible to determine a specific cause based on itching alone. he will need to see a medical provider or dermatologist for a proper examination but in the meantime he can try some medicated over-the-counter shampoo used for dry scalp conditions to see if it helps. a pharmacist can help him chose a proper one.	the back of my head itches and is starting to have hair loss but baldness does not run in my family. what is the cause?
i think it is reasonable to wait at least six weeks and only with the consent of the patient’s obstetrician. there are changes that the body undergoes after pregnancy as it kind of “shrinks down” if you will and returns to normal pre-pregnancy physiology. typically that is going to take place in the first several weeks and just to make sure we suggest a six-week interval between the delivery and the cosmetic procedure. it is never wrong to wait a bit longer because the patient might not quite feel up to it and has other new responsibilities as a parent. as indicated above a physical examination must be done including blood counts and all the necessary laboratory tests to know that at that point the patient’s body is functioning just as it would had the patient never been pregnant.	how long should i wait after my pregnancy before having cosmetic surgery?

for common skin warts many dermatologists agree that it’s perfectly fine to try over-the-counter wart treatments for a couple of months. if your warts don’t go away during that time or if they get worse it may be wise to seek medical attention. dermatologists have a variety of wart treatment and removal techniques that are stronger and work faster than commercially available products. also remember that all warts can be “mother” warts that give rise to additional warts in your skin. so the faster you remove the wart the less likely it will spread.	when do you need to see a doctor about warts?

well unless you live in one of the states that permits the use of medical marijuana (and you have a valid prescription for it) then the law says you shouldn't be using it at all. but let's assume you do have a medical marijuana prescription. in general i wouldn't think smoking cannabis would interfere with the action of prednisone. prednisone is a steroid preparation that treats inflammatory conditions. i must add however that few studies have been done to evaluate potential drug interactions with marijuana. so the real answer to your question is: we just don't know if using marijuana while taking prednisone is harmful or not. hope that helps!	is it harmful to use cannabis while taking prednisone?
"osman the most likely cause may be anxiety related. below is a link to a webmd article that lists many possible causes of high b/p combined with a rapid pulse rate: <link> according to the american hearth association there is no direct correlation between rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. here is what the american herat association says on the subject: "" a rising heart rate does not cause your blood pressure to increase at the same rate. even though your heart is beating more times a minute healthy blood vessels dilate (get larger) to allow more blood to flow through more easily. when you exercise your heart speeds up so the blood can reach your muscles. it may be possible for your heart rate to double safely while your blood pressure may respond by only increasing a modest amount. "" other factors that are unknown may also influence a diagnosis as follows: what was your blood pressure and heart rate? what activities were you engaged in prior to being tested? how many times was the testing performed? was the testing conducted on a reliably calibrated machine? was the testing performed at various times of the day? what was your pulse pressure? that number is the difference between your systolic b/p (higher number) and the diastolic (lower number)? for example a b/p of 150/70 would have a pulse pressure of 80 which is high. as you see in this example the systolic b/p is on the slightly high side & the diastolic b/p is within a normal range but the pulse pressure is high. some experts today consider a high systolic rate along with a high pulse pressure to be a serious risk factor in predicting cardiovascular disease. it is best to see a physician and discuss your concerns. that person will be in the best position to know you conduct professional testing assess the testing results and address your questions. i hope that this answer has been helpful."	what is the relation between high blood pressure and high heart/pulse rate? . i have read that when the volume of blood is high the bp rises and the pulse slows down and vice versa however in my case the bp rises when when pulse rate increases. can you please explain this relation in bp and pulse in detail. . . . thanks. . . . osman

"there is research that shows that barbecuing can be hazardous to your health. but don't worry there is still a way to have your ""barbecued steak"" and eat it too. the health problem lies in the meat. research has discovered two cancer-causing (carcinogenic) byproducts associated with barbecuing red meat poultry lamb pork and fish. the first is a carcinogen called heterocyclic amines (hcas). the national institute of health department of health and human services included hcas on its reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen list. hcas are formed due to the high temperatures occurring when meat is overcooked or char-grilled. studies have shown that when hcas were fed in the diet rodents developed cancers in many organs including the colon breast and prostate. research is still underway to determine if this applies to humans as well. the second carcinogen associated with barbecuing is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). they are formed when fat drips onto the coal or hot surface. the smoke carries the pahs to the food. they can also form directly on the food when it is charred. the recipe for healthy barbecuing is to follow some simple tips: don't get too hot: try to avoid overcooking food by precooking it in the microwave or oven so it won't be on the barbecue as long; keep the heat down on the grill and flip the food frequently to prevent overcooking on one side; buy thinner cuts of meat so that they don't take as long to cook; and test the meat with a thermometer to see when it's ready. the usda recommended safe minimum internal temperatures are: steaks & roasts - 145 degrees f fish -- 145 degrees f. pork -- 160 degrees f. ground beef -- 160 degrees f. chicken breasts -- 165 degrees f. whole poultry -- 165 degrees f. trim the fat: go for leaner cuts of meat; cut as much fat off of the meat when possible; and flip your food instead of stabbing it with a fork to avoid the fat dripping onto the coal. take time to marinate: some research has shown the ingredients (especially vinegar) in marinades act can actually protect the meat and reduce the chances of carcinogenic compounds forming. one study found that a beef steak marinated with teriyaki sauce had a 45% and 67% lower hca level at 10 minutes than the unmarinated steak and that lower levels of hca were also observed in meat marinated with turmeric-garlic sauce. keep it clean: keep the oil and grease off your grill by turning up the heat to high and closing the lid for about 10 minutes."	what are potential health problems that can be connected to eating barbecued and smoked meats?

hi how to start a diet it would be a good thing to your dachshunds food intake by one third of its normal daily amount and this does include meals and treats. replace dog biscuits and other treats with carrots apples and oranges these last two you can do as a mix. most dogs enjoy the taste of fruits and vegetables and it is healthier for them. replace a small portion of their meal with green beans or a mix of carrots and peas. if your dachshund eats one cup of food replace one third of the meal with either of the veggies above. this will reduce the calorie amount and provide them with a healthy filler food. dogs do love a good exercise routine with your dachshund. whether it is throwing a ball to play fetch or taking your dog on a walk exercise will always help with weight loss. and dogs do love there walks even if it rains just get out there with them its both of you good twice a day is very good. think of feeding your dachshund a raw meat diet. but try talking this through with your vet first. do hope this helps you. good luck	is feeding a dachshund that is overweight half a hotdog and two teaspoons of wet dog food healthy? . my in-laws think that giving their overweight dachshund too much wet dog food will make her fatter. however they don't think feeding her half a hot dog will do that. are they right or wrong?

"it's impossible to answer your question because the answer is different for every single substance. what you're really asking is ""how long does it take the body to metabolize (break down and eliminate) various legal and illegal drugs""? the prescribing information for legal medications includes the drug's ""half-life. "" the half-life is the length of time it takes the body to metabolize half the active ingredient. thus if the half-life of a drug is 12 hours it means half of the active ingredient will still be circulating in your blood 12 hours after you take the medication. that gives you some idea of how long it takes the body to metabolize that particular drug. however we're not talking about a perfectly curved graph when it comes to drug metabolism. you should not assume if a drug has a 12-hour half life that all of it will be eliminated from your system in 24 hours. it might be. or maybe it will all be eliminated at the 18 hour mark. pharmacokinetics is a precise science. in terms of illegal drugs think of it this way: if you take no illegal drugs they will stay in your system for exactly zero hours for drug testing purposes. in other words if you avoid taking illegal drugs you need not worry about drug testing. anyway you shouldn't be taking illegal drugs. (i'm excluding marijuana from this category simply because some states have now legalized it. my exclusion of marijuana does not imply i endorse or approve of using it. ) there are a whole host of problems that go along with taking illegal drugs -- one of which is you don't really know what you're taking. there's no safe ""dosing"" level. they interact very badly with prescription medications. the list goes on. best bet: if you know you're going to be subjected to random or routine drug tests make sure you have a valid prescription for any medication that might turn up positive and avoid taking illegal drugs. wishing you well!"	how long do various legal and illegal drugs stay in your system for drug testing purposes?

surgery to remove cancer is almost always the main treatment for colorectal cancer. the type of surgery depends on the size and location of your cancer. side effects are common after surgery. you may be able to reduce the severity of your side effects at home. for more information see the home treatment section of this topic. surgery choices local excision. when colorectal cancer is discovered in its very early stages it can be removed during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. the surgeon cuts out not just the polyp but also a small amount of tissue around it. the surgeon does not need to cut into the abdomen. bowel resection. this operation involves cutting out the cancer as well as the sections of the colon or rectum that are next to it. then the two healthy ends of the colon or rectum are sewn back together. the surgery can be done in two ways: open resection. the surgeon makes a long incision in the abdomen completes the bowel resection and closes the incision. open resection is the best option for cancer of the rectum. 9 laparoscopic surgery. instead of needing a large incision in the abdomen laparoscopic surgery requires only 3 to 6 small incisions. the surgeon inserts a camera or laparoscope and other operating instruments through these incisions to perform the operation. because the incisions are smaller there usually is less pain and recovery is faster. in some cases the surgeon may make 1 or 2 of the incisions a little bigger during surgery in order to complete the procedure but the opening is still far smaller than in an open resection. open resection is best for cancer of the rectum but for other colon cancers laparoscopic surgery is equally effective. 9 but laparoscopic surgery cannot always be done such as when the cancer has spread to areas outside the colon. what to think about polypectomy or local excision is used when the cancer has been caught in its early stages. bowel resection is used when the cancer is larger. sometimes after this major operation the two ends of the colon or rectum cannot be sewn back together. when this happens a colostomy is performed. most people do not need a colostomy. for more information see: bowel disease: caring for your ostomy. colorectal cancer comes back after surgery in about half of people who have surgery to remove the cancer. 7 the cancer may be more likely to come back after surgery if it was not discovered in an early stage. even if your doctor thinks that all the cancer has been removed during surgery radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be recommended to destroy any remaining microscopic areas of cancer. clinical trials are designed to find better ways to treat people with cancer and are based on the most current information. some people who meet the criteria for participation choose to enroll in such clinical trials. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for colorectal cancer?

"well let's establish a few medical facts before we delve into the issue of whether or not valacyclovir caused the symptoms you described. first of all the flu--or influenza --can only be caused by coming in contact with the influenza virus. thus taking valacylovir and going for a run cannot ""cause"" you to get the flu. second 'nausea' is not a symptom of influenza. the flu is a respiratory virus. it affects your nasal passages and lungs. it's true if you swallow a lot of post-nasal drip caused by the influenza virus you might get nauseated. but generally speaking the flu is a respiratory virus. it's true that nausea and headache are potential side effects of valacyclovir. however i'm not aware of fever and chills being known side effects of this drug. to be fair the most common side effects of all medications are nausea and diarrhea so i tend to consider those as 'expected' side effects. if your flu-like symptoms persist you definitely should return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. enlarged lymph nodes should not be taken lightly. if your fever exceeds 101. 3f seek emergency medical attention. meanwhile drink a lot of fluids. it's entirely possible you coincidentally picked up a virus just as you began your course of valacyclovir. the onset of your symptoms may have nothing to do with the medication but the symptoms are worthy of being evaluated further if they don't go away within a couple of days. wishing you well! in response to the answer above i never said the valacyclovir caused the flu the specific term i used was ""brought on"". also a common symptom of the flue (as i found online) is vomiting. so unless people vomit without feeling nauseous i dont see how nausea isnt a symptom of the flu. thanks for your response though."	i want to know if the flu-like symptoms i'm experiencing are from the valacyclovir i was prescribed. i was prescribed valacyclovir for treatment of hsv1. i had been taking 500mg twice daily for 4 days. on day 4 i went on a 2 mile run. i noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were somewhat swollen and tender. after sleeping for 6 hours i woke with flu symptoms. tight neck headache congestion nausea fever chills etc. i read online that these symptoms are also common side effects of the valacyclovir. is it likely that the medication in combination with the run just brought on an actual flu?

"interestingly yes you can use breast milk for diaper rash. although i'm not aware of any studies that prove it works many women claim it does. it certainly can't hurt to try. my concern is when you say the rash is ""all over. "" i hope you mean ""all over"" the baby's bottom. if your baby is having a rash above the waist you should seek medical treatment. with diaper rash prevention is better than treatment. remember diaper rashes thrive in moist environments. it's very important that you thoroughly clean and dry your baby's genitals groin and bottom with each diaper change. and never leave your baby ""soaking"" in wet diapers. change the diapers regularly. instead of commercial baby wipes try cleaning with a soft cloth and plain water to make sure your baby isn't having an allergic skin reaction to something in the wipes. wishing you and your baby well!"	can you use beast milk on a diaper rash. she has a bad rash all over.
antithyroid medicine is often used for hyperthyroidism because it works more quickly than radioactive iodine therapy. radioactive iodine therapy destroys part or all of the thyroid gland depending on the dosage used. but antithyroid medicine does not cause permanent thyroid damage. you may take antithyroid medicine before you have radioactive iodine treatment or surgery-to bring your metabolism to normal to make you feel better or to reduce the chances of more serious problems. antithyroid medicine does control hyperthyroidism in many people. but the medicine does have some drawbacks. you have to take the medicine for at least 1 year. your symptoms may come back after you stop taking it. and then you have to start taking antithyroid medicine again or try a different treatment. there are some rare side effects from the medicine ranging from a rash to a low white blood cell count which can make it hard for your body to fight infection. your doctor may prescribe additional medicines to treat symptoms caused by hyperthyroidism such as rapid heartbeat or dry eyes. these medicines can help you feel better while you wait for another treatment to begin to work. medication choices antithyroid medicines additional medicines what to think about antithyroid medicine may or may not make your hyperthyroidism permanently go away. somewhere between 30% and 50% of people will have their hyperthyroidism go away (go into remission ) after taking antithyroid medicine for 1 or 2 years. 3 antithyroid medicine works best if you have mild hyperthyroidism if this is the first time you are being treated for graves' disease if you are younger than 50 or if your thyroid gland is only swollen a little bit (small goiter). it is not used for thyroiditis. antithyroid medicine is used instead of radioactive iodine if you are pregnant breast-feeding or trying to become pregnant. children are treated with antithyroid medicine because experts do not know if radioactive iodine treatment is safe for children. treating children with antithyroid medicine is challenging. it is hard to know how much medicine they need when they are growing so quickly. your doctor may prescribe low doses of thyroid hormone medicine to take with your antithyroid medicine so that your thyroid hormone levels do not get too low. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat hyperthyroidism?

no sepsis itself is not contagious. sepsis is an out-of-control infection due to bacteria viruses or other invading organisms. when an infection becomes uncontrolled localized symptoms (like diarrhea from e. coli food poisoning or coughing and sneezing from influenza) become serious whole-body symptoms like a rapid heart rate low blood pressure and confusion. although a person’s infection itself may be contagious (you’d have to know the specific organism to say) sepsis is a complicated response to infection that varies widely between individuals and is poorly understood in general. however it’s clear that most people with sepsis don’t transmit their infection to anyone else and most people with infections (from any cause) don’t get sepsis.	is sepsis contagious?

My height is 5'5"", and weight is 69 kg. I have been suffering from acne, redness and often small, red, pus-filled bumps on my face since I am 14. I visited a lot of dermatologists, but they never able to identify the reason. I have got prescriptions and that never really helped me. The conditions worsened a year ago, and I got them on my cheeks, forehead and nose. I thought that it was a normal acne until I finally visited an experienced dermatologist, who suggested that I had subtype 3 rosacea, sensitive and oily skin. He prescribed me some medicines first, and it gave me huge relief. I got rid of all the acne within 10 days. Three months passed and as the winter season came nearer, they again started appearing all over my face and then gone after some time. I visited dermatologist again who suggested me to take regular peels. I started taking sittings of peeling and after one or two peeling my face started improving and got clear in some time. Peeling worked like magic. It was superficial face peel, but do not know about the acid content and the type of acid he used to apply. He used to say that he was giving me mild peel. I stopped taking peeling as I had to leave my place and shift to the different location due to the job change. It was good for a couple of months until the temperature change. I started getting rosacea symptoms again though at this time rate of acne and bumps was low, still, it bothered a lot. Currently, I am on medication which my old dermatologist suggested. It is Papulex face wash for summer, non-drying cleanser for winter, Fisioativ cream for the night to moisturize the skin and Fix Derma UV protection, which I still apply daily thrice a day. The only thing I notice is that in my case rosacea comes back when there is a temperature change and also some stress. But, peeling is the only real magic for me. Please suggest the best possible peeling solution available. Can I use it at home probably once in 15 days?"

you can have both medicare and va coverage though they don't work together. medicare won't pay for any care you receive at a va facility. but va benefits can be used to help pay for services that medicare doesn't cover. there's no cost to enrolling in medicare part a so you may as well do that. the possible advantage of enrolling in medicare part b coverage (which pays for outpatient care and does come with a monthly cost of about $104) is that you'll gain access to services outside of the va system. when it comes to covering the cost of prescription drugs the va coverage is in many cases more generous than that of medicare part d so it may or may not be beneficial for you to purchase a part d plan. the best thing to do is talk with someone who can help walk you through your options and help you determine the best course of action for your medical and financial needs. you can get free assistance with medicare by contacting your local state insurance assistance program which you can find by visiting www. medicare. gov/contacts or by calling 1-800-633-4227.	i am covered by the va with a rating of 100%. would i still benefit from medicare or medicaid?

no. the drainage from the sinuses is quickly contaminated from nasal mouth and throat germs so you cannot diagnose sinusitis by this method. sinusitis is typically diagnosed by an array of characteristic symptoms (sinus pressure pain) coupled with corresponding examination findings (tenderness decreased light with transillumination - shining a bright light into the sinus area in a darkened room) or by x-ray or ct scan findings. most cases of sinusitis are viral and will be self-limiting but some require antibiotics or allergy mangement. see your medical provider.	can a lab test be done on coughed up mucus to determine if i have a sinus infection? . 10 days of coughing up thick yellow mucus facial pain all around sinus . antihistimines and mucinex seem to just mask symptoms but don't take away

the typical fertile window is 3-5 days long and it is just before you ovulate. ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before the next menstrual period starts. so in a 30 day cycle ovulation should occur around day 16 and your fertile period is between cycle days 11-16. the fertile window is determined when the cervical mucous becomes more elastic and receptive to sperm. some women notice that is is more slippery when they wipe during this time. men need to ejaculate once within a week of the fertile window to increase the number of younger sperm that will be in the ejaculate during the fertile window and have intercourse at least once during the fertile window. the day the opk turns positive is probably the last day of the fertile window so i would try a little earlier. don't worry about the semen leaking out of the vagina. that is normal. only about 10% of the sperm are expected to get into the cervical canal which is a reservoir and will release sperm slowly for days after intercourse to ensure that sperm are present when the egg is released.	if i am trying to get pregnant when should i have sex if the ovulation predictor kit tells me what day i ovulated? . and what can i do keep the sperm inside me longer?

i don’t think that there is quite enough research yet to justify the claim that red peppers can treat hypertension. the simple answer is that there never is one “super food” that should be emphasized more than any other to treat any health condition. i would suggest looking into the dash diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). the dash diet emphasizes fruits vegetables fat-free or low-fat dairy products whole grain products fish poultry and nuts. it’s also lower in red meat sugars and sodium. this diet has been shown to lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people. a healthy eating plan such as the dash diet along with a consistent cardiovascular exercise routine can be part of an effective treatment and management plan for hypertension. consult with your doctor further and please visit the following website for more information: <link> hi yes your right google cayennepepper do it as one word it will take you to a site all about cayenne pepper look down the left hand side its all there. good luck	is red pepper a good supplement to treat hypertension. i have read that a ingrediant in red pepper is very good at treating hypertension

it's starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot. in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast. i don’t always do well with things that are slow. however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you don’t have to think about it again until it’s time to eat. here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock-pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush. the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients. this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat. these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken. (by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats. so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that — or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat. ). when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily. and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone. if you’ve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely you’ve participated in the biggest mistake: do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker. period. ever. using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie. canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can. cooking them for another 6-8 hours will disintegrate them. potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker. using canned tomatoes is fine — mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well. absolute no-nos: canned green beans canned corn and canned peas. actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it. under-seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time. since the food is cooking there for so long — the equivalent of a long slow boil — there needs to be a few levels of flavors. there are a couple ways to do this. if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest sautéing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot. the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step. also add fresh-cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly. add ingredients that are high in flavor. for example fire-roasted tomatoes or fire-roasted chilies. another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat. a half piece of bacon has about 1. 5 grams of fat depending on the size. not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor. can you tell i’m a fan of bacon? here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup. take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken. for every four cups of water throw in a 1-2 inch piece of ginger root and about 4 whole garlic cloves. then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high. at the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon. the slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldn’t experience if it was cooked quickly. and not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone. you can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast. throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night. you can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots — these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor. yes it’s slow but worth the wait. enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us. i want to see crock pot what it looks like most foods that are cooked in hard bottom in covered pot can be cooked fast with high heat according the type of food	how can my crock pot help me make fast healthy food?

gonorrhea is a sexually-transmitted disease so if you truly have an accurate diagnosis of gonorrhea involving your penis you did not get it from kissing a girl twice unless this kiss involved your genitals and she had pharyngeal gonorrhea. non-sexually transmitted gonorrhea is technically possible if you had penile contact with fresh secretions like a toilet seat or wearing someone's contaminated underwear but as you can imagine this rarely if ever happens. so if you are being 100% honest and i assume that you are then i would have no idea how you got it. if you had a throat culture that grew out neisseria (the genus of gonorrhea) then it will need more thorough laboratory testing since there can be an innocent gram-negative bacterial species of neisseria that grows in the throat that is not gonorrhea.	i am a gonorrhea patient. but i never had sex. i just kissed a girl twice. so what is the reason? i m so depressed. pls hp
it's important to use an eye makeup remover that's specific for waterproof mascara. i am not a big fan of waterproof mascara for that very reason. i think it does coat the eyelashes a little too heavily and can be difficult to remove and sometimes the eyelashes can come out with it. fortunately the eyelash cycle is pretty quick so your hair will grow back very quickly over time really within a matter of a few weeks. but it's uncomfortable if you are using it over a long period of time to keep losing lashes like that. so i would try recommending a water-based mascara except for very special occasions when you really need something longer lasting. then if you have the waterproof mascara look for something that's very specific and take your time. let it sit on your lashes for a little bit longer and then rinse with lukewarm water and then repeat the process without rubbing because it's the rubbing that can physically remove the lashes.	i am losing eyelashes when i wear waterproof mascara. what can i use to clean my face that won't damage my eyelashes?

"another ridiculous claim. all supplements including food are absorbed in the intestines. the stomach is only part of digestion. there are some pharmaceuticals that are designed to withstand the highly-acidic stomach environment by special coats or being encapsulated but i would have no idea if this company that claims to be giving you ""live stem cells"" in a capsule has this technology. stem cells -- especially those from animal sources -- are never administered orally."	is there such thing as supplement that only digest in intestine only? . in a talk i went to the presenter told me that the supplement which is a live stemcell (purtier riway) is specially made so that it will only start to break out and being absorb by the body in the intestine which through the technologies use to encapsule the live stem cell would prevent it from being dissolve by the stomach acid and later being release in the intestine so that the unharmed live stem cell to be absorb by the body and not kill by the stomach acid.

"i don't know what ""thing"" you are talking about. was it an instrument to clean out earwax and other debris or was it just the funnel-like tip of the otoscope (the instrument with the light). if your ears hurt during the exam. and still hurts the clinician most likely scratched or abraided the very sensitive lining of the ear canal. you may need some antibiotic drops so call this person tell him the story and have him call in a prescription for you. no sense in you paying for another visit unless he plans on doing it for free."	i went to an ent who put the thing used to look inside my ears too deeply inside them and they still hurt 3 days later. it was very painful at the time and i wish after the first ear i'd said something. this makes me very scared that the pain won't go away as i initially went to the doctor because my ears were getting more sensitive to certain frequencies and ringing but not in physical pain (which is now added). i just need to know if this is something that will go away in time.

"there is no convincing evidence that any herbal remedy will help people lose and maintain weight loss. here is the run down on the most promising ones. i highly recommend you spend some time figuring out why you carry excess weight and then focus on that. some people eat because they have dieted for years and feel deprived. others may eat because of stress or due to uncomfortable feelings. other simply eat very large portions and don't know when to stop which may be because they were raised to ""clean their plates"" and this habit continued. once you get a good handle on what is causing your weight you can then work on getting the help you need to deal with it. that might be seeing a therapist and registered dietitian (go to eatright. org to find one in your area). if you have significant health problems due to your weight you might even benefit from weight loss surgery or a medically supervised diet. for more tips on finding the right program for you see this article. most people can lose weight but it's keeping it off that is the hardest. if you work on the reasons you are overweight and not just the symptom of the weight itself you will be more likely to succeed. good luck! if you want to reduce your weight in herbal manner then honey will be the good solution for it. honey contains 22 amino acids and a variety of minerals essential for its metabolism and hence is helpful in preventing obesity. dissolve half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder in a cup of boiling water. stir the mixture and cover for half an hour. filter away any big particles and add a teaspoon of honey. take it in the morning with an empty stomach about half an hour before breakfast. this is the best home remedy for weight loss. one of the most effective herbal remedy i know is the apple cider vinegar. it contains a certain fiber which is known as the pectin which helps in flushing away fats and toxins. dr schweiger - <link> green tea."	which is the most effective herbal remedy for weight loss? . i am suffering from obesity and feeling uncomfortable and also demoralized because of your extra pounds

you’re right in that the 220 – age formula to calculate maximum heart rate is outdated and doesn’t hold much merit. this particular formula was developed by william haskell in 1970 and he openly acknowledges that he didn’t use a very representative sample and that it was only meant to be used as a rough estimate. there have been many other studies that have attempted to develop a maximum heart rate formula since haskell developed the 220 – age formula in 1970; the only problem is that i don’t believe there is a consensus in regards to which among those is the most appropriate formula to use. there have even been other formulas developed that attempt to distinguish between males and females and others that differentiate between athletes and non-athletes. the 220 – age is the easiest method of calculation for maximum heart rate applicable to the general population though it’s certainly not the most accurate. there are other formulas developed by different researchers but i don’t believe that there’s a clear consensus in regards to which is the most accurate or the best replacement	how was maximum heart rate determined? . your target heart rate calculator page claims to calculate the highest safe heart rate during exercise using the formula 220 minus age for maximum heart rate. i thought haskell and fox made up that formula in 1970 from 11 experimental studies of maximum attainable heart rate and no subjects were harmed in these experiments. if that's so that formula has nothing to do with safety. am i right? if not what studies were used to determine what heart rate is safe?

methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa is an increasingly common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections. mrsa has become a common bacterium causing skin infections in people that seek medical attention. most skin and soft tissue infections begin with redness irritation warmth and swelling of the infected area. because community-acquired mrsa is a virulent (aggressive) bacterium the infection may develop quickly and create a painful red swollen bump on the skin. this may be called a furuncle a boil or an abscess. itching is not one of the main features of mrsa infection. most skin itching is due to dermatitis -- skin that’s inflamed by non-infectious causes. allergies dry skin eczema or chemical irritation are some of the most common causes of skin itching due to dermatitis. dermatitis tends to be mild and come and go while often a true mrsa skin infection tends to get steadily worse without treatment. that’s not to say that an mrsa infection can never itch. for example skin that’s already irritated and itchy (as from a dermatitis) is more vulnerable to infection by mrsa or another bacterium. an mrsa skin infection by itself might be itchy at first but it would be expected to become tender or painful as the infection progressed.	does mrsa itch?

too advanced of a medical problem to identify you'd have to ask a medical professional that has studied psychiatry or a specialised nurse to get the best answer. no ordinary en or rn can answer that question so webmd is probably the worst place to come. i'd visit a psychiatrist and get examined schizophrenia is a very specific issue you could easily have something on the autism spectrum also these places are very specific the could be a drug or chemical like asbestos that could be causing this eventually wearing off when you leave. but honestly i know nothing about asbestos or mental disorders this is just my advice from a paramedics perspective.	do people with schizophrenia only hear voices while in there home or do they hear them everywhere they go. my nosey neighbors are trying to make me believe i am schizophrenic. that when i hear them speak they are not what i hear and in stead that they are voices in my head. . but i dont hear them when i am not at home! i know what i hear but its odd that few others hear it. do people with this sickness hear the voices they hear outside of there home where they generally hear them. like when at the store or the mall? because i dont have that. only when home. normal or schitzo?

i certainly understand her reluctance to seek medical attention when she doesn't have insurance. many communities offer free or low-cost clinics to people who are uninsured. maybe you can help her find one of these. i think your daughter needs to get this checked out. it may be completely benign such as a lipoma (a fatty non-cancerous tumor). but then again it could be something more serious. certainly if your daughter has a fever or is experiencing unintended weight loss she needs to be checked out as soon as possible. you might encourage your daughter also by reminding her the cost of an office visit is substantially less than the cost of an emergency room visit so why put off getting this thing looked at? i wish your daughter all the best!	my daughter has a lump on the right side of her neck. it feels hard and is tender. if you make a circle with your thumb and pointing finger it is about that size. it is literally on the side of her neck not where i would think glands are. it is noticable without touching it. without insurance she is reluctant to go to the doctor but i'm concerned.

"a number of medical associations and organizations have made recommendations on screening for thyroid disease. some of the recommendations are listed below: all women who are planning a pregnancy should be considered for screening of thyroid disease. all pregnant women with a goiter (enlarged thyroid) high blood levels of thyroid antibodies a family history of thyroid disease or symptoms of hypothyroidism should be tested for hypothyroidism. in women who are borderline or sub-clinical hypothyroid and who also have positive antibodies -- which may indicate an ongoing autoimmune thyroid destruction -- therapy with low dose thyroid hormone at the onset of pregnancy may be beneficial. there is some evidence that the antibodies that may contribute to hypothyroidism can play a role in pregnancy. data suggest that selenium supplementation may be of benefit in women with high antibody levels at the time of preconception. this should be reviewed with your doctor. women who are on thyroid hormone replacement before pregnancy should also be tested to make certain that their levels are appropriate. during pregnancy the medication dose required may increase by up to 50%. increases may be required as early as in the first trimester. dosing is dynamic during pregnancy and should be closely monitored by regular blood testing. as the pregnancy progresses many women require higher doses of hormone replacement. the dosage of thyroid hormone replacement during and after pregnancy should be carefully monitored using the blood thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) value. the laboratory ranges for normal tsh are quite wide. most clinicians like to keep women who are pregnant and on replacement in the ""hyper"" end of the normal range. this usually equates to a tsh of 2. 0. many clinicians prefer tsh in the 1. 0 range. in women with hypothyroidism before conception most go back to their pre-pregnancy dose of thyroid hormone within a few weeks to months. it must be stressed that these are only guidelines. the management of each woman's situation is considered individually after consultation with her doctor. the benefits of treatment extend not only to pregnant women with hypothyroidism but also to their children."	what can be done to avoid the consequences of hypothyroidism in pregnancy?

i would talk to my doctor about: 1 - if this is a short term side effect that over time will get better or 2 - if you can switch and try something else don't just suffer - if you have the right doctor they will work with you on this. i really hope you feel better and find something that works for you. there are more options than ever these days.	why is my birth control causing me acne? . i started getting bad acne on my last bc i asked to be switched to ocella. i have never had acne i was on something similiar to ortho tri cyclen. its been almost a full two packs and i dont notice much of a difference everytime i think its getting better i seem to get 3 or 4 new pimples in the same spots. i now have scarring all over my cheeks it makes me cry looking in the mirror and im just not sure what to do. these a deep cystic pimples that hurt then on my chin.
most episodes of diarrhea are mild and of short duration and do not need to be brought to the attention of a doctor. the doctor should be consulted when there is: high fever (temperature greater than 101f). moderate or severe abdominal pain or tenderness. bloody diarrhea that suggests severe intestinal inflammation. diarrhea in persons with serious underlying illness for whom dehydration may have more serious consequences for example persons with diabetes heart disease and aids. severe diarrhea that shows no improvement after 48 hours. moderate or severe dehydration. prolonged vomiting that prevents intake of fluids orally. acute diarrhea in pregnant women because of concern for the health of the fetus. diarrhea that occurs during or immediately after completing a course of antibiotics because the diarrhea may represent antibiotic-associated infection with c. difficile that requires treatment. diarrhea after returning from developing countries or from camping in the mountains because there may be infection with giardia (for which there is treatment). diarrhea that develops in patients with chronic intestinal diseases such as colitis or crohn's disease because the diarrhea may represent worsening of the underlying disease or a complication of the disease both requiring treatment. acute diarrhea in an infant or young child in order to ensure the appropriate use of oral liquids (type amount and rate) to prevent or treat dehydration and to prevent complications of inappropriate use of liquids such as seizures and abnormal blood electrolytes. chronic diarrhea.	when should the doctor be called for diarrhea?
you have al the signs of dehydration and hypovolemia from poor fluid intake which causes your blood pressure to go down especially when you first stand up. since you are keeping food down now then i would try to find foods with the highest protein content like eggs peanut butter beans also fruit such as blueberries strawberries bananas(which have a high potassium content that you loose with vomiting/diarrhea). i'd suggest you make some fruit smoothies and throw in some spinach to help your fluid intake too. if water gets boring for you try pedialyte in the baby section of the grocery store. it has the elcetrolytes that you loose with vomiting/diarrhea. you may also try ensure or boost which also has vitamins minerals and electrolytes. good luck in your recovery.	after vomitting and horrible diarrhea i am still nauseas dizzy and very weak 2 days later why? how can i fix this? . i had food poisoning after a day i thought i was done. the next day i felt extremely faint dizzy weak couldn't barley stand and quite nauseas again. and i woke up this morning all the same symptoms. but at least i am keeping food down. so why am i feeling like this still? how can i counteract the weakness and dizziness? i have so much to get done i need a band-aid for at least a few hours of normalcy to get stuff done.
"you did not get gonorrhea from being touched by someone's finger or ""rimmed"". you got gonorrhea from having sex (anal and/or vaginal) with a guy that had gonorrhea and passed it to you because you did not insist on him using a condom. you are not practicing safe sex so this may be the first of many serious health consequences you will be experiencing. your hiv and other std tests may have been negative this time but unless you get smart and start protecting yourself it is only a matter of time before you will be exposed to something more difficult to treat than gonorrhea."	how risky is getting rimmed and fingered? . i about 3 weeks ago got rimmed by a guy and he fingered me after about a week of this episode i got gonorrhoea. i am freaked out what if i had hiv with gonorrhoea as i am unaware of his hiv status. . i got myself fully tested as i started to have pain in my ractal area. i went to full screening and was diagnoes with gonorrohea but the rest of stds were neg i am worrying so much and feel like hiding. the test was done at about 2 week after the exposure. the test was hiv duo p24.

a lot depends on how extensive the eye bags are. if the underlying causes are medical or from lack of sleep these issues should be addressed first. next consider discussing the use of fillers with your dermatologist. properly placed fillers along the lower eyelid and cheek junction can mask the presence of eye bags. i don't know how practical this is for everyday to use but you can do this before a special occasion. lay down close your eyes and let a slice of cucumber rest on your eyes for 10 minutes.	is there any nonsurgical procedure to get rid of my eye bags?
get a second opinion from another urologist. a prostate biopsy is not a pleasant procedure so it should only be done if absolutely necessary. his psa is fine but the psa is not the definitive marker. i don't know his age or risk factors but if his prostate examination is normal. his psa is normal. i am puzzled by the recommendation. the urologist has a responsibility to justify this procedure so have a face-to-face consultation and hear has rationale. i know from personal experience the psa is a very questionable test designed to promote more tests and more expenses by the male populace. my psa is 10. 49. i have acute bacterial prostitus. this is treatable with powerful antibiotics. if you still have fear (that's what they want! ) then by all means have the dr. order a cat scan and then you will know the truth. j. ben my psa was 6-8 and had 2 biopsies no bumps no cancer but because my doctor did not like the signs he did a ( saturation biopsy) which then showed i had a gleason scale of t8 which at that point it starts spreading to the boney structures and lymph glands! the simple biopsy only hits a small part of the prostate. had he not been persistent and dependent upon my psa i would be planning my funeral. take this seriously! those who belittle the psa should have their tongues cut out.	my husbands urologist wants him to have a prostate biopsy. he has no lumps. psa was 1. 8. is this biopsy necessary? . what are the chances of cancer with a psa this low?

i don't believe that testosterone has anything to do with affection and intimacy. those emotions are between a man's ears than his legs. more than half of the people in this world do not have testosterone or extremely low levels. women and children for example. and they show plenty of affection need cuddling kissing and share lots of affection. if a man were surgically castrated for whatever reason this should not adversely affect his ability to show any of these important (and vital) human emotions. this issue is less likely to be biological and more likely to be psychological but it can be complex. while that may be difficult for a man to accept he often will need to be reminded that his biggest and most important sex organ is his brain. if he needs help a counselor can really help (if you can get by the stubbornness and get him (or you) to go).	can low t affect a man's ability to show affection (not sexually)? . showing a level of intimacy that does not lead to sex. for example touching cuddlying kissing a desire for giving and receiving affection.
you're wise to check your own blood pressure regularly after being put on medication for high blood pressure. doing this will help your health care provider titrate (fine-tune) your medication dosage appropriately. clinically low blood pressure is defined as anything under 90/60. (this can vary depending on the fitness level and age of the individual. ) if you've been placed on medication for high blood pressure you can consider a consistent reading below 90/60 as being too low. a normal adult resting pulse rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. it's not unusual for a person's heart rate to occasional go above 100 beats per minute however especially during any type of activity or exercise. if you experience sustained resting pulse rates over 120 then it would be a good idea to call your health care provider. because you feel abnormally tired and sleepy you might make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your blood pressure treatment. there are many blood pressure medications available and if this combination isn't working for you your doctor can try something else. i wish you all the best!	when is your blood pressure to low? and when is your pulse to high? . i was recently put on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. i am concerned because i am staying tired and sleepy. i keep a check on my blood pressure but would like to know what is considered to low. also my pulse rate ranges from 70's to 90's. has hit 100 and 103 a couple times. what is a safe pulse rate?

rose did you ever go to the doctor? all i can think of for you to do days later since the tylenol has already been adsorbed would be to have lab work drawn to see if there was any damage to the kidneys or liver. otherwise i am not really sure. i hope you are ok at this point.	i accidently overdosed on tylenol by taking 21 in a 12 hour period. it is a few days later and i have no symptoms. i don't know what is should do. this was regular strength 325 mg tylenol. it is 4 days later the only symptom i have is upper right abdominal pain. any thoughts? thanks

an ear infection is usually limited to the ear. you may have a runny nose & nasal congestion with it but it should go away within 10 days. if it is viral antibiotics are not needed; if it is bacterial antibiotics will help. since you have additional symptoms and it has been going on for 2 weeks it is important you see a doctor. flushing and chest tightness is not a part of an ear infection so see your doctor so she can examine you to find out why this is happening.	can a ear infection cause my face to start flushing? . after getting over a coldish sinus thing my face started flushing. it happens while im just sitting at my desk not doing much. it happens everyday and can last a few minutes or sometimes for like a hour. this has been going on for about 2 weeks now and now im back to having some sort of sinus thing. i dont have any nasal congestion but i has sinus pressure post nasal drip and now my chest feels tight like its also congested.

retin-a or tretinoin is very effective in reducing fine lines and wrinkles as well as evening out pigment and shrinking pores. it's really the only fda approved anti-wrinkle anti-aging cream that has years of scientific proof that it works. it takes several months to see the effects and should be used under the supervision of a board-certified dermatologist. it can cause dryness peeling and redness and should be used along with a moisturizer. i usually recommend cetaphil or olio lusso facial oil to mitigate the dryness. one should also apply it very sparingly at night and of course always wear sunblock during the day. it shouldn't be used with glycolic acid or other peeling agents. be patient see your dermatologist and you will see results.	how effective is prescription tretinoin. 05 on fine wrinkles and patches of rough skin? how long does it take?
running certainly does burn lots of calories and if you're running regularly you might decide not to eat as much figuring why do it if you're putting all that energy into running. but even if you ran a marathon every day you wouldn't lose weight unless you consumed fewer calories than you burned. the bottom line to losing weight is burning more calories than you consume no matter how much exercise you do. running is a great way to expend calories and boost your metabolism to promote weight loss. however i would recommend slowly and gradually building up your exercise routine to jogging. start out by walking and then gradually add more days per week or time per session. you can also try walking with intermittent bouts of jogging. eventually you can build up to where you are doing mostly jogging instead of walking. from there you can work on increasing how long you jog or your speed while jogging. a couch to 5k program might provide good direction on how to gradually transition from walking to jogging. it’s important to start a routine in this slow and gradual fashion to allow your body time to acclimate and adjust to your exercise routine and to avoid any injury. if you are considerably overweight it might be best to refrain from jogging altogether until you lose weight. the extra weight can put a high demand on your joints while jogging since it is more of a high impact exercise.	will running help me lose weight?

i'm sorry you're experiencing this. unfortunately the only way to diagnose what's going on is through a physical examination. many things could cause the bump you're describing such as a small cyst. only a medical professional can tell you what's going on. the key points here are: you have a bump where there shouldn't be one and it's uncomfortable. those two facts alone warrant a trip to the doctor. this isn't an emergency but why not go see your gynecologist to get this diagnosed and treated if necessary? best wishes to you! i have in the past had what amounted to a pimple in that area before. if you can stand it! leave it alone! use cold and heat if it helps! if not better in a few days go to the doctor! i couldn't stand it! did what you are not supposed to do! instant relief and healing. have found in my 46 years that i am not alone! very common from what i hear. good luck! best wishes.	small bump near entrance of vagina no discharge or anything hurts when wiped over not sexually active. what is it? . today when using the restroom i noticed a small bump near the entrance of my vagina it hurt when i wiped and it's pretty uncomfortable in general. there hasn't been any kind of discharge from it. i'm also not sexually active. what could it be?

it is very common for all men and women to experience small aches and pains due to muscoloskeletal issues or tissue wear and tear. the analysis of your history and symptoms do not indicate that you have serious neurological issues like als. this is true since all the tests including the mri have been found to be normal. the other possibilities would be that you have a low threshold to pain or they could be due to psychological issues. conditions like fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndromes might also be a possibility. it would be recommended that you consult a rheumatologist and a psychiatrist who can help with proper diagnosis and also proper counseling and behavior management to help you manage and live with the pain. i hope this helps.	last year my right hand often had the cramp from the shoulder until the fingertips. 4 months later my back felt slightly painful like period pain's. 3 months after that the pain went upwards until the end of my neck near to my head it was painful to raise my head up. this year 3 weeks before my chest started to feel heavy and hurtful. both of my back and chest felt as if shards of glasses were slashing along the ribs and spine. short of breath most of the time. now my right leg the calf is having some sort of muscle cramp along the bone just like how it is like with my back. i was told by friends that i walked unstably but i don't drag it though. sometimes forgetful and emotionally unstable. maybe due to the stress. cannot sit or stand or lay down for too long. i'm getting thinner and lost 5 kg i eat a lot. went for mri xray blood test urine test nothing next appointment i'm going to have brain mri and emg. any possibility of me having als? what is wrong with me?

so sorry to hear you're going through this. i can think of few things worse than a sinus headache! your best bet is to make another trip to the doctor for a re-evaluation of your symptoms. it sounds like you're doing everything right in terms of taking your prescribed medications checking your shower for mold and mildew etc. since your symptoms have continued after finishing the antibiotics you were prescribed you'd be well-advised to go back for further evaluation. your health care provider may want to try a different type of medication to help manage your symptoms. in the meantime you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers as directed on the bottle. this may help some with the pain. good luck to you. feel better soon!	after getting sick (step i believe) a sinus issue developed. has persisted and i'm having pressure headaches now. i took amoxicillin when i got sick. sinus issue persisted and developed into pressure headaches between the eyes. i went back to the doctor and was prescribed clarithromycin. it seemed to help a bit but after finishing my prescription i'm still having pressure headaches. the drainage is going into my throat and is mostly clear/white sometimes yellowish. changed the shower head and continually spray my shower with anti-mold (though dark mildew keeps seeping through caucing). what can i do?
"most helpful answer of course it is legal and yes doctors and other licensed medical providers (like pas and nps) can prescribe it. the brand name is cialis and it is used for erectile dysfunction. it should not be prescribed or used for someone who just wants to ""party"" or has erectile difficulties because of illegal drug use."	is tadalafil legal and can doctors prescribe it?

hi. i understand your concern. its actually very rare to get reinfected by chlamydia without having sexual intercourse with a infected partner. the tablet he took must have definitely worked at that time and it doesnt seem to be the issue here. the organisms do remain in dormant stage in gut but these can get active only if his immunity falls down considerably. i suggest that you should consult a doctor for sure.	Question: My boy friend and I have been diagnosed with Chlamydia..he is re infected?
as a warning to others and regarding the last responder it's a really bad idea to buy accutane or any of its equavlents from a no-prescription online pharmacy. this is because there is a lot of medical oversight needed for the safety of the patient and if you get pregnant while taking the stuff you can end up with some really serious birth defects in the fetus. it's also meant to be taken in a very specific way and it's not suited to be self administered. add this to the inherent danger of online no prescription required pharmacies and you have a very bad combination. by the way taking this without a prescription is illegal in the us and quite a few other countries and for once i agree with that.	i am 17 year teen boy. i have been getting acne on my face from last 3 years. what should i do? . well i am getting acne on my face continuously. i tried various products but none of them worked. 3 years i have been through this. i also have problem of more than average sweating. are they interrelated? what should i do to stop acne?
"yes. just stop eating. weight loss occurs when your body takes in less than it needs. how fast you lose that 10-15 pounds depends on many factors including how much you weigh right now. a pound of fat is 3 500 calories so if you ate 1000 less calories a day than you need to maintain your ideal weight (about 15 calories per pound of ideal weight) you will lose about two pounds a week. 8 pounds a month. in about 6 weeks you can safely reach your goal. you can lose it faster or slower but when you exercise you can ""reshape"" and look like you lost more. yes. definitely you can lose fat with exercise. start following slow carb diet as i did with out exercise. this diet is little strict but you can definitely follow it and get the best results. it will change your habits all together. below are few rules you can follow: #1 avoid “white” carbohydrates #2 eat the same few meals over and over again #3 do not drink calories #4 do not eat fruits #5 take one day off per week"	can i lose weight without exercising? . if u may please tell me how and how long. i'm looking at 10-15 pounds
