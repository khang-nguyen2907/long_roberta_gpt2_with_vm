i recommend that he be evaluated by an allergist (if not already done) to help determine whether he is truly allergic to eggs and milk or if these were some other type of adverse reaction. it is important because if he is allergic consumption of the food could lead to a severe allergic reaction and they should be avoided. most children with egg and milk allergy are ultimately able to eat it by age 5 and an allergist can help determine when (and how) to attempt re-introduction.	my 13-month-old gets mild hives after eating eggs and vomited after having dairy at 8 months. what can i do?
there are several effective treatments for shingles. drugs that fight viruses (antivirals) such as acyclovir (zovirax) valacyclovir (valtrex) or famciclovir (famvir) can reduce the severity and duration of the rash if started early (within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash). in addition to antiviral medications pain medications may be needed for symptom control. both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and narcotic pain-control medications may be used for pain management in shingles. the affected area should be kept clean. bathing is permitted and the area can be cleansed with soap and water. cool compresses and anti-itching lotions such as calamine lotion may also provide relief. an aluminum acetate solution (burow's or domeboro solution available at your pharmacy) can be used to help dry up the blisters and oozing. in may 2006 the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) approved the first vaccine for adult shingles. the vaccine developed by merck laboratories and known as zostavax is approved for use in adults ages 60 and over who have had chickenpox. the shingles vaccine contains a booster dose of the chickenpox vaccine usually given to children. tests over an initial four-year period showed that the vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of shingles in these older adults. the single-dose vaccine was shown to be more than 60% effective in reducing shingles symptoms and it reduced the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (phn see above) by at least two-thirds. studies are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine over a longer term. there are certain contraindications to receiving the shingles vaccine. people with weakened immune systems due to immune-suppressing medications cancer treatment hiv disease or organ transplants should not receive the shingles vaccine because it contains live weakened viral particles. there is not enough information available from researchers to decide at this point whether zostavax may be beneficial in people younger than 60 years of age. since the chickenpox vaccine is now recommended for children the incidence of chickenpox has been reduced. this is also expected to reduce the incidence of shingles in adults in the future as these vaccinated children age.	can shingles be prevented with a vaccine?

a bunion is an irregular bony prominence (a bump) on the joint where your big toe meets the main bones of your foot. the bunion causes the end of the big toe to bend toward the other toes and crowd them while the bone at the base of the toe where it meets the foot moves outward beyond the normal limits of where the bone should be. pain is caused by inflammation and the bone pressing against the shoe. bunions are more common in women and are caused by a number of reasons including shoes that are too tight years of abnormal motion (like dancers on point) poor foot mechanics bone deformities flat feet and arthritis. treatment usually includes shoes with a roomy toe box (you should be able to wiggle your toes; the toe box should be wide enough to accommodate the bony prominence) padding over-the-counter arch supports orthotics and taping by a physical therapist or doctor. surgery is an option when conservative treatment fails and you have chronic pain. as for exercises keeping your feet strong and building up the arch might help (particularly if you have flat feet). although there isn't a lot of evidence for strengthening feet as an effective treatment for bunions it's certainly worth a try. here are some exercises to strengthen your feet. do 10-15 repetitions of each two to three sets every other day. 1. towel pull. sit in a chair barefoot with your toes on the edge of a towel. start flexing (curling) your toes and pulling the towel to draw it up under your toes. 2. big toe pulls (barefoot). wrap a thick rubber band around both big toes and pull them away from each other. you can keep heels together if you like but it's not necessary. hold each repetition for two to three seconds. 3. marble or pencil grab (barefoot). while sitting or standing try to pick up marbles or pencils with your toes. consult with your doctor or a podiatrist if you have not already done so.	are there any exercises that can ward off or help bunions?

basically anytime that you have unprotected sex (the condom broke) you are capaple of getting pregnant however there are only a few days every month that you are ovulating. two days before your period is not the time you would be expected to ovulate so if you have a predictable regular cycle you are not likely going to get pregnant from this one isolated mistake. however if there were other mistakes in the last month or so then anything is possible. wait another week or so and take another home pregnancy test or see your medical provider for a more accurate pregnancy test and exam.	can i be pregnant if i had sex two days before my expected period? . i had sex two days before my expected period. we used a comdon but it broke. he pulled out. i am now four days late and have been spotting for the last 3 days. its not stress because i am not stressed. in the last four days i gained 4lbs and been nauseous. i took a pregnancy test once and it was negative. could i still be pregnant?

the key to enjoying cookouts is to know what foods agree with you. if grease bothers you stick with grilled foods or vegetables. instead of tomatoes load up your salads with carrots beans jicama or other milder veggies. burgers are ok but get the leanest cuts and dress them with guacamole or something else less acidic than catsup. if carbonated drinks lead to late-night torture stick with iced tea. if margaritas and you don't get along drink less or switch to a virgin strawberry type. watermelon can be acid-producing. consign it to a mixed-fruit salad only. eat smaller portions. your stomach detects large amounts and pumps out more acid.	what can i eat at a cookout that won't give me heartburn?
most helpful answer has your brother seen a medical professional for the symptoms you describe? he obviously was diagnosed with an enlarged spleen and fatty liver disease but has he been seen for the vomiting and weight loss? if your brother vomits up everything he eats or drinks he's at serious risk for dehydration. you shouldn't allow vomiting to go unchecked for any period of time. unfortunately a forum like this isn't a place to receive a diagnosis. it's impossible to tell what's going on with your brother without doing a physical examination and possibly some lab tests. could the vomiting burping loss of appetite and weight loss be related to the enlarged spleen? probably not. could they be related to the liver problems? maybe. or they could indicate some other illness or disease entirely. your brother needs to see a doctor to find out for sure. any time a person is experiencing symptoms like unexplained weight loss we get a little concerned. it could be something minor or it could be something serious. there's no way to tell without a physical exam. wishing you well! these all symptoms may be due to liver disease. for the clarification of spleen involvement get his blood tested for complete blood count. you need to see an expert who may examine your brother and provide proper diagnosis.	is this dangerous and what disease is this is? . my brother is suffering really bad. he got an enlarged spleen and an enlarged liver fatty liver. excessive colonic gases they are not really enlarged kind of mild. he suffers from the following:. vomiting after eating or drinking anything. vomiting solids food is not digested. it takes him 5-10 minutes after eating/drinking to throw up. burping before vomiting. nausea. loss of appetite. weight loss. what do you think that is? i need an expert to answer me. is it really something dangerous?

"no i wouldn't recommend wet wipes or anything like that for treating pinkeye. conjunctivitis is also called ""pinkeye"" and refers to inflammation (redness and swelling) of the membranes that surround the eye. usually conjunctivitis makes the white part of the eye look bloodshot and the lower lid may appear swollen. you may experience burning itching and drainage from the eye too. if you think you or your child might have pinkeye you should see a health care provider as soon as possible. there are different types of conjunctivitis some that do well with treatment. also conjunctivitis is highly contagious so you or your child should not go to school or work until the cause has been determined. be sure to wash your hands often and thoroughly if you have pinkeye. baby wipes antibacterial wipes and wet wipes should never be used around the eye. to get rid of the ""gunk"" (drainage) that often goes along with pinkeye use a wash cloth or paper towel soaked with lukewarm water and gently clean the outer eye area. cool compresses may help with the burning and itching. symptoms of pinkeye usually go away within a week. if you still have symptoms after a week it's time for a trip back to the doctor. hope this helps! sorry you're feeling miserable. absolutely not! see your eye doctor for meds. its an infection!"	does baby wipes anti bacterial wipes and wet wipes help ease the burning sensation of conjunctivitis?

your best bet for a good answer to this question is to consult your pharmacist. that said we usually tell women taking oral birth control pills to use secondary birth control (such as a condom) when taking any antibiotic (such as bactrim) because some antibiotics may reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. bottom line: if you don't know for sure if a particular drug is interfering with your birth control pills always use a back-up solution. hope this helps!	does bactrim interfere with or reduce the effectiveness of yaz (birth control) to prevent pregnancy?

while the irexis (sindafilate citrate) name is similar to that of viagra (sildenafil citrate) it is not comparable to viagra. there have been no studies comparing these two products side by side. irexis contains many herbals plus zinc. the company claims that the product will have an effect on sexual impotence. but keep in mind the product is not fda approved and a number of herbals have knowninteractions with over-the-counter and prescription medications. we do not know enough about these herbals to claim that they are safe and effective. while irexis is available without a prescri ption and may be more affordable than viagra the risk of uncertainty outweighs any possible benefit.	is the vitamin supplement irexis (sindafilate citrate) an alternative to viagra?

with poison ivy poison oak and poison sumac the sap in the leaves stems and roots of these plants contain an oil called urushiol (pronounced yoo-roo-shee-all). many people have an allergic reaction when urushiol touches the skin which produces the rash. you may be caught by surprise thinking you haven't touched any of these poisonous plants -- thinking only of the leaves -- but you may have unwittingly come in contact with their roots or stems. urushiol quickly penetrates the skin often leaving red lines that show where you brushed against the plant. from 12 to 72 hours later symptoms appear. scratching the itchy rash doesn't cause it to spread but can prolong skin healing and cause a secondary infection. the rash isn't contagious so you won't spread it to others by going to school or work. three types of transmission can occur: direct contact when you touch or brush your skin directly against the plant. indirect contact when you touch pets gardening tools sports equipment or other objects that had direct contact with the plant. airborne contact from burning these plants which releases particles of urushiol into the air that can penetrate your skin eyes nose throat or respiratory system.	what causes the rashes from poison ivy oak and sumac?

most helpful answer the important thing is that you understand why the dessert is in your meal plan. talking with your therapist is key because he or she is likely doing it to help change your relationship with food. the tendency with eating disorders/disordered eating is people give too much power to a single food instead of looking at the overall pattern of eating. as for your health no eating a sweet food everyday will not ruin your health (i do it! ) especially when your diet is balanced. it's the extremes that are harmful -- eating sweets/chips/empty calorie foods all day long or eliminating so many foods/items that it's hard to maintain a healthy weight and enjoy eating. i hope that helps. good luck on your journey!	what health consequences will i face because of my meal plan for my eating disorder and the desserts that i eat nightly? . i am currently recovering from an eating disorder and have to follow a meal plan. sadly this requires me to eat dessert every night. i have been doing so since about mid-february. i am a fitness and nutrition fanatic (this did not help in developing an) and i have a major fear of suffering health consequences due to the fact that i am forced to eat sugary desserts every night. is there any health repercussions? what should i do?
the exact cause of penile cancer is not known but there are certain risk factors for the disease. a risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. the risk factors for cancer of the penis may include the following: uncircumcision. men who are not circumcised at birth have a higher risk for getting cancer of the penis. human papilloma virus (hpv) infection. hpv includes more than 100 types of viruses that can cause warts (papillomas). certain types of hpv can infect the reproductive organs and the anal area. these types of hpv are passed from one person to another during sexual contact. smoking. smoking exposes the body to many cancer-causing chemicals that affect more than the lungs. smegma. oily secretions from the skin can accumulate under the foreskin of the penis. the result is a thick bad-smelling substance called smegma. if the penis is not cleaned thoroughly the presence of smegma can cause irritation and inflammation. phimosis. this is a condition in which the foreskin becomes constricted and difficult to retract. treatment for psoriasis. the skin disease psoriasis is sometimes treated with a combination of medication and exposure to ultraviolet light which may increase a person's risk for penile cancer. age. over half of the cases of penile cancer occur in men over age 68.	what causes penile cancer?

this is a great question. nuvigil is also a fairly new medication that is approved for two indications; it's actually approved for narcolepsy and also for sleep shift disorder. so this would be for people who work the night shift or crazy shits; during the 3 a. m. to 11 a. m. type of thing and they have a problem with sleeping. nuvigil actually works on chemicals in the brain and its intent is to keep you up. so yes it's going to keep you up but once again it's used for the treatment of narcolepsy so that makes perfect sense.	i am wondering if nuvigil has any kind of stimulant in it; i am on 150 milligrams?

often i am posed with questions about the significance of the sun protection factor (spf) number. there is an assumption that the higher the spf number the more protected you'll be from the sun. but you need not seek the highest spf available because beyond an spf of 30 you will be getting little additional protection. the american academy of dermatology recommends using sunscreen that has an spf of 30 or greater that protects against uva and uvb rays and that's water resistant. it is important to know that uvb rays are those that cause bad sunburns and are associated with skin cancer. uva rays tend to be the culprit for skin aging but can also influence the development of skin cancer just not as ambitiously. therefore i recommend using a product that protects against both uvb and uva rays. it's important to know what happens to your sunscreen when you get in the water. water will dilute sunscreen so you'll need to reapply it reasonably often. the recommendation is that a water resistant sunscreen be reapplied after 40 minutes spent in a swimming pool or the ocean. sunscreens that claim to be waterproof tend to be a little heavier and more oily and should keep you protected for up to 80 minutes. the difference between sunscreen and sun block is that sunscreen protects your skin by absorbing and reflecting uv rays. sun block reflects and scatters uvb rays and creates a barrier between your skin and the sun. remember that the sun allows the body to perform a self-conversion for vitamin d which is essential for the calcium metabolism that impacts the strength of your bones. vitamin d is very important and in fact may be critical in the prevention of certain cancers.	what do i need to know about sunscreens and sun blocks?
no there are not over-the-counter alternatives. adderall is a highly-abused drug that is often diverted sold or given to others so my skeptical eyebrows tend to raise when someone states that inadvertently threw it away. those of us in the medical profession get stories like this all of the time and unfortunately accidents can happen. perhaps he is telling the truth but if his adderall is gone. he will not likely get another prescription until his time is due. sir i am sure everything you say is true but your answer was very non-responsive. you are correct he will not get his renewed dosage for another four weeks. i stated that in my question and it is in fact the very reason i asked the question. secondly and happily his girlfriend found the bottle in one of their christmas shopping bags this morning. they had gone to the pharmacy while running christmas errands and things got mixed up a bit. thank you.	my 25 year old son lost his adderall and can't get a replacement for 30 days. is there an over the counter alternative? . my son got his new monthly prescription two days ago and inadvertently threw the bottle away thinking the bag it was in was empty. he will not be able to get his monthly dosage until his next appointment in 30 days. is there a safe over the counter alternative he can use which at the least will help to lessen the focus and concentration issues that will inevitably arise. thank you for any guidance you can give.

xeomin has been fda approved specifically for the vertical frown lines between the eyebrows. apparently this product was previously approved for use in adults with cervical dystonia a condition in which spasm and contractions of the neck muscles produce a very uncomfortable and unsightly appearance. likewise it had been approved for blepharospasm which is involuntary flickering of the orbicularis muscle which surrounds the eye. to give you the most authoritative information i am now going to quote from a review article written by yael halaas md: “botox dysport and xeomin have a lot in common but they also have some important differences. unlike its predecessors xeomin does not need to be refrigerated. this may be an advantage when it comes to distribution. what’s more xeomin is “naked. ” there are no additives – just botulinum toxin type a. this may lessen a patient’s likelihood of developing antibodies to xeomin. when your body senses a foreign invader it responds by creating antibodies and launching an attack. if this were to occur with a neurotoxin such as botulinum toxin type a it may not have its desired effects. xeomin is said to be more like botox than dysport. it takes about one week for the full effects of xeomin injections to be realized and once this occurs the results last from 3-6 months. dysport xeomin and botox should not be used interchangeably. they should also only be administered by skilled injectors such as board-certified facial plastic surgeons in sterile environments such as medi-spas or doctors’ offices. xeomin should not be injected in beauty salons malls or at xeomin parties in the home. ” always discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of each particular product. i can tell you however that so far the botox cosmetic and dysport class of drugs have been very safe and very successful.	is xeomin as effective as botox or dysport for reducing the appearance of wrinkles?
i broke my spine at l4 l5 on top of a nerve with cyst. i had surgery and decided to take jobs where i could walk. well you always seem to end up dragging heavy things around which is not good for you. also do not go bowling - that a no-brainer but evidently i do not have one. i find walking is the best and i agree it is boring so. i walk in big stores because it is more interesting. wal-mart is great because it is so big you can keep a good pace. i have a huge herniated disc and nerve room involvement just where i had the spinal fusion surgery. i am in pain right now and the nerve block did not work. i am also a little scared because i do not know what is going to happen next. i went to physical therapy because the insurance required it before my nerve block. they could not work on my back because it was too swollen - but you might benefit you. i have been to other physical therapists and they were not that helpful. i really like this one - results physical therapy. they may be a chain. they will give you exercises (that make sense and help. ) good luck - do not forget to use an ice pack because that helps (i use frozen peas wrapped in a towel. thanks denise	what types of exercise are contraindicated for someone who has had a l5-s1 spinal fusion? screws were removed. my fusion has been complete for several years but i still have chronic pain. excercise can help but i'd like to know what not to do with having my l5-s1 vertebrae fused. also which types of exercise and stretching would be most beneficial? i have tried walking which gets painful for me and bores me to tears. i also am not fond of pilates.

disinterest in sex is not uncommon but can be very complex. there can be many many different reasons -- impossible to sort out in the forum. if having a pleasurable sex life is important to you and i know that it is your first step would be to see your gynecologist to see if there is some organic reason for your lack of libido. the next step assuming a medical reason is not found would be to see a counselor -- a therapist that can help you uncover any psychological reasons for this issue. this problem can be fixed i am sure but you have to take the first step.	get bored having sex. sex has isn't very fun to me. it feels more like work than play. my boyfriend has been trying different things to help me but i just don't have fun. the first 5-10 minutes are fine but after that i'll hurry to fake an orgasm so he will ejaculate. he gets upset because he is always the one seducing me but the reason i don't seduce him is because i just don't like it! i don't know how to enhance my sex drive its really annoying.

it does not take much force at all to crush the larynx. crushing the human throat takes roughly that same amount of pressure as crushing an empty soda container. this is why a move such as a throat gouge should never be used in a fight. the only time this kind of move should be used is if it is life or death. a hit to the throat can easily kill a person and is not to joked with. i hope this clears your doubts.	hi. my name is roberto writing from italy. i write here because i'd have a question i can't resolve in my hometown. let me introduce me: i'm a karate black belt and i like to study anatomy in order to be as more effective as i can. my question is about windpipe's rings resistance to pressure and/or strikes. in short i'd like to know how much it takes to crush/to flat trachea's cartilages with a sharp strike to the cervical part of the throat. thankyou for your attention and patience.
ringworm is just a skin fungus (not a worm). as long as the skin lesion is covered and under some topical anti-fungal medications it poses no risk to others or the food service. yes he can work. keep in mind that this skin lesion has been self-diagnosed so this recommendation assumes he is correct. there are several skin lesions that can mimic ringworm so it would be wise to get it properly examined and diagnosed.	is it safe to work with ringworm? . i have a co-worker who thinks he has ringworm but he does not have health insurance so he cannot go to a doctor. we work in the food service industry and i was wondering if it was possible for him to continue working using gloves etc while it clears up or if he needs to stay home until it is gone?

hi this is from the mayo clinic. for someone who doesn't have diabetes a normal a1c level can range from 4. 5 to 6 percent. someone who's had uncontrolled diabetes for a long time might have an a1c level above 8 percent. when the a1c test is used to diagnose diabetes an a1c level of 6. 5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates you have diabetes. a result between 5. 7 and 6. 4 percent is considered prediabetes which indicates a high risk of developing diabetes. for most people who have previously diagnosed diabetes an a1c level of 7 percent or less is a common treatment target. higher targets may be chosen in some individuals. if your a1c level is above your target your doctor may recommend a change in your diabetes treatment plan. remember the higher your a1c level the higher your risk of diabetes complications. your find more at this link. <link> if this dose not show blue just copy into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck ps yes get exercising and look up what to eat to get back on track try googling the diabetes diet you should find all the help you need.	my a1c test showed my number at 6. 7 can i improve my number with diet and exercise? i do not want to take medication

a cough in a healthy 4 year old can be many things. most commonly colds from viral infections can cause coughs. other causes can be allergies post nasal drip and asthma. if your child has had the cough for several weeks it is important to speak to your doctor. if he has allergies or asthma that is causing this there are medications available to make him feel better. call your doctor.	my 4 year old has been coughing only in the late evening during the night and until mid-morning for many weeks now. . i usually give him 1 to 2 l'il critters gummy vites that have echinacea vitamin c and zinc in them every day. he doesn't cough during the day. he had a cold a few weeks ago which has since gone away except for this cough. it actually starts late in the evening right around bedtime continues off and on during the night when he changes positions and then starts to go away around mid-morning. . . i would say it's probably more of a dry hacking cough. could it be whooping cough?

i have carefully reviewed your health query and feel sorry for your father's health issues. it is a concerning disease process. i never recommend to leave it as such and do nothing much for an advanced coronary artery disease. he has got triple vessel involvement and in such circumstances the best next step is to go for cabg surgery (coronary bypass graft) especially if there is no obvious contraindication. no partial angioplasty is not a solution to the problem. although he has no obvious signs or symptoms but you should know well that the disease inside has progressed much and anytime with or without strenuous physical activity he may get a severe heart attack that can be really dangerous and lethal. i would go with the suggestion of cabg right away. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My father is diagnosed with coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease with LM.

the liver is a workhouse for metabolism of protein and fat (lipids). when there is an excess of lipid in your blood than the capacity to metabolize by the liver the excessive lipids start to accumulate in hepatic cells known as fatty liver. this is an ongoing process if not taken proper steps to prevent it. i am sure that your liver is not in bad condition at all and it can be reverted to normal metabolism by regular exercise intermittent fasting use of omega fatty acids containing oils in diet reducing fat content in diet and by avoiding alcohol. the probable causes:diet and alcohol. investigations to be done:lft (liver function tests) and ultrasonography abdomen. probable diagnosis:fatty liver. treatment plan:conservative treatment. preventive measures:1. regular exercise. 2. intermittent fasting. 3. use of omega fatty acids containing oils in the diet. 4. reducing fat content in diet. 5. avoiding alcohol. regarding follow up:for further information consult a medical gastroenterologist online. ---> <link>	"Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old male.

bph (benign prostatic hyperplasia) is an enlargement of the prostate gland. this gland surrounds the tube that drains the urine from the bladder. the symptoms of bph can be caused by a tensing of the enlarged muscle in the prostate gland which blocks the passage of urine. this can lead to such symptoms as: a weak or start-and-stop stream when urinating a feeling that the bladder is not completely emptied after urination a delay or difficulty in the beginning of urination a need to urinate often during the day and especially at night a feeling that you must urinate immediately.	what is bph?

there are certain key foods that really seem to keep you feeling satisfied for longer such as beans! i find when i have a bean burrito for example even if it's on the smaller side it really stays with me. another bean idea is edamame (green soybeans) just a bowl of these can really satisfy your hunger. basically foods with a lot of soluble fiber or protein and/or water content help make this happen. beans are rich in all three. smart fats can keep the contents in the stomach a little longer too. foods with monounsaturated fat (olive oil olives nuts) and omega-3s (fish canola oil walnuts soy and pecans). here are some foods rich in soluble fiber: beans. oats. barley -- look for soups with barley! some fruits (apples mango plums kiwi pears blackberries strawberries raspberries peaches citrus fruits). some vegetables (artichoke celery root sweet potato parsnip turnip acorn squash potato with skin brussel sprouts cabbage green peas broccoli carrots cauliflower asparagus and beets). one of the best pieces of advice for you though may be to drink some hot tea when you are feeling hungry again keep some liquid in your stomach and warm liquid tends to hang out in the stomach a little longer too. green tea is full of helpful phytochemicals so find some flavors you really enjoy (tropical green or peppermint green tea etc. ) or warm up some broth or tomato-based soups as a mid-meal snack.	any tips on finding healthier snacks that are going to keep me full?

"it's difficult to answer your question due to some key information that's lacking. for example ""laser resurfacing"" can be done any almost any body part. usually after laser resurfacing of the face we advise patients to keep the skin slathered with moisturizer at all times. that's because the laser can cause severe drying of the skin. however for some people all that goop on the face can indeed cause a breakout of pimples. i suggest you consult your provider to find out if what you're experiencing is normal and if so how to treat it. laser resurfacing of the face also can cause a flare-up of cold sores. if this is the type of ""breakout"" you're referring to then you again should consult your provider to see if you can take a prescription medication to treat the cold sores. whenever a person undergoes a procedure like laser resurfacing they should receive clear written instructions that detail post-procedure care. if you don't receive written instructions you definitely need to ask a lot of questions and take notes about how to care for your skin after laser resurfacing what the normal healing process entails and so on. hope this helps!"	is it normal to break out after a laser resurfacing procedure and what should i do

if the boy parts touch the girl parts whether you ejaculate or not there is always a small chance that pregnancy could occur. sperm can be viable in the clear mucous that emits from your penis during sexual excitation. the chance is very remote however so i think you are good. this time. if your girlfriend is also having sex with someone else that would be a different story. having a little scare like this is good practice if you continue with your risky sex-play you are eventually going to have sex. why not try and prevent it? your partner should be on an effective method of birth control and you should be wearing a condom. an erect penis is a loaded weapon my worried friend. yes absolutely. if she is worried of possibly being pregnant then its always a possibility if she has been active in sex. i would think the next best question to ask is. could she be pregnant with my baby in which case i would highly doubt the possibility. you must ejaculate. she must be exposed to some way of having sperm get into her. otherwise either she is really young and fear filled from ignorance and myths she is a manipulator trying to make you feel guilty or she thinks she really is and has had sex with someone else and is still a manipulator trying to make you think its yours. you dont give her age or experiance or other times of sexual encounter. # rod moser pa phd this is not an answer i could not find a reply button. thank you very much for your quick reply it did give both of us a scare and we told each other that we would not be doing anything like that again. do you think that the levonorgestrel will help? should she take another to be sure? i know you said that there was a very small chance but i just really want to make sure. also is levonorgestrel the same as the morning after pill? thanks luis garcia	could my girlfriend be pregnant? . so last week my girlfriend and i laid naked in bed. we didn't have sex we did touch each other and i didn't not ejaculate. my gf told me that she has missed her period and she is worried that she may be pregnant. i told here that there was no way sense i did not penetrate her and i did not ejaculate. as a precaution i went to the drug store and bought her levonorgestrel a hormone that is used to prevent pregnancy. is there anyway possible that she could have gotten pregnant?

for people with obstructive sleep apnea (osa) a cpap machine can be a life-changing device. i’ve written about the importance of regularly using your cpap machine before but there may be even more benefits to use of a cpap. most people with osa aren’t aware that they stop breathing multiple times during the night. this results in fragmented poor sleep as well as low blood oxygen levels. osa has been associated with an increased risk for myriad health problems including hypertension heart disease mood and memory problems — even difficulties driving. cpap stands for continuous positive airway pressure and cpap machines are the most effective and helpful treatment currently available for patients with osa. a new study in the journal sleep suggests that cpap therapy can do much more than improve sleep: patients who regularly use a cpap machine felt significantly less fatigue throughout the day. patients who regularly use a cpap machine also had much more energy. patients felt considerably less daytime sleepiness particularly patients who had previously been excessively sleepy or fatigued. scientists aren’t certain how and why cpap therapy can have these additional positive effects but they think that cpap may reduce inflammation which in turn reduces fatigue. whatever the reason this is great news for people who have osa — and even better news for people who are already using cpap machines to improve the quality of their sleep. i’ve said before that the cpap machine isn’t exactly the most attractive or sexy addition to your bedroom. but in addition to completely transforming the way a person with osa sleeps it also has the potential to help people feel less fatigued and have more energy throughout the day. we already knew that cpap improves the quality of sleep of many many people — and spares their partners hours of listening to the snoring and loud breathing that can accompany osa. this study just gives us a few more reasons to recommend that patients with osa use their machines every night. the amazing machine that could. i use a bipap every night and it has made a significant difference in the way that i feel - at least in the morning. unfortunately in addition to sleep apnea i have severe hypersomnolence and i often fall asleep at my desk during the day while working. i can really feel the difference when i fall asleep without using my bipap and my throat is often dry and sore. yes! i have sleep apnea. when should my bipap or cpap machine be used?	i have obstructive sleep apnea. do i need to use my cpap machine every night?

by shots i assume you mean insulin. the key to bringing down your blood sugar is to track your carbohydrates since they are what raise blood sugar. foods rich in carbohydrates include bread/grains beans fruit milk and yogurt and added sugars such as those in sweet foods and beverages. foods rich in protein and fat do not raise blood sugar like carbohydrates do. protein foods include lean meats poultry fish eggs and tofu. fats are items like butter vegetable oil nuts and seeds and avocado. vegetables are typically recommended because they are low in carbohydrates but high in nutrients. so they can be consumed in large amounts. the key is to include healthy carbohydrates in controlled amounts while including protein vegetables and healthy fats with meals. if you consume sweetened beverages switch to water. i highly recommend seeing a diabetes educator to help you put it all together. below are some articles that might help: healthy diabetes diet 6 foods that may help control your blood sugar how does my diet affect diabetes? cinnamon fenugreek garlic avocados and nuts blueberries which are also a great source of soluble fiber and a number of other important nutrients red cherry vinegar can help you in lowering the blood sugar. <link> top essay writing service	foods to bring down your blood sugar naturally. i would like to know what foods to eat to bring down my blood sugar naturally. i do not want to take any of the shots as they cause cancer and there is enough cancer in my family line now.

unfortunately my answer is: many things could cause this. floaters in the eye aren't uncommon. these tiny flecks of tissue can well float through your vision from time to time. the condition is usually harmless but in some cases can point to more serious underlying eye problems. so if this visual disturbance is a new symptom you should visit an ophthalmologist soon to get it checked out. migraine headaches also can include a component of visual disturbance called an 'aura. ' if you're experiencing the visual distortion you describe with a headache you'd be well-advised to see a medical professional for treatment. occasionally the type of symptoms you're describing can be an indicator of something serious like retinal detachment. if the symptoms are severe or you notice them getting rapidly worse please go to an emergency room. these conditions need to be treated promptly. otherwise you might start with your primary care provider or an eye doctor to see if you can get to the bottom of what's going on. good luck!	what causes moving visual distortions?

call your doctor if you notice any of the symptoms of pneumonia. in many instances you need immediate treatment to recover and avoid complications. in addition call your doctor if: your sharp chest pain does not get better with prescribed treatment; you have increased shortness of breath; or your fingernails toenails or skin becomes dark or develops a bluish tinge after diagnosis. this may mean that you are not getting enough oxygen into your blood and you need medical assistance. you cough up blood; you may need additional treatment for a worsening infection.	when should i call the doctor if i have or think i might have pneumonia?
you are correct. dark red or brown urine could be blood although there are medications and even certain foods that can change the color of the urine. this would have nothing to do with your recent hep b vaccine. one common cause of blood in the urine would be a urinary tract infection even if you are not feeling any other symptoms. just the way a nose can suddenly bleed the bladder can do the same. this would be high on my list if you were female. urinary tract infections are uncommon in men. a kidney stone can cause urinary bleeding as well. i would be advisable for you to see your medical provider today and have a urinalysis to see if you are indeed having a urinary tract bleed. if not your medical provider can search for other possibilities. two nights ago had dark red urine?	i am very concerned. i noticed today my urine if very dark and red or brown maybe blood. . the only recent change i have epericenced would be a hep b vaccine shot last week. i have no injuries. and this is a very sudden change.
most cases of atopic dermatitis can be diagnosed from a medical history and a physical exam. you will be asked about your family history of allergic conditions when the itch first started and when the rash first appeared. what the rash look likes and where it is located will help your doctor make a diagnosis. your or your child's condition is more likely to be atopic dermatitis if a parent or brother or sister has an allergic condition (especially asthma allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis ). allergy testing your doctor may recommend allergy testing to identify any factors that are related to atopic dermatitis flares. allergy testing is most helpful for people with atopic dermatitis who also have respiratory allergies or asthma. allergy testing can help identify certain allergens. but test results are often false-positive. for more information see the topic allergy tests. if a specific allergen is thought to trigger your atopic dermatitis you and your doctor will discuss how to eliminate it from your diet or environment while closely observing and recording your symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for atopic dermatitis?

"i can't blindly tell you ""what it is"" over the internet. i would need to examine you and perhaps send a specimen off to pathology. clearly the dermatologist is your skin specialist so if you lesion is bigger i would suggest that you go back. forego the steroid injection until you consult the dermatotogist again or see a different dermatologist for a second opinion."	i have a bump on my nose that has been there since sep. i saw the dermatologist and he scraped it. now it is bigger. the dermatologist said that it may be a vascular hemangioma but i don't think i agree. it started as a raised bump on the bridge of my nose after he scraped it it has grown from 3mm to 10mm and now has visible blood vessels. i saw a plastic surgeon and he wanted to inject it with a steroid to see if that would shrink it but he is not certain what it is either. the dr. said that it is uncommon for adults to have a hemangioma and i can't find anything online that is similar to me. what is it?
it certainly warrants having a doctor check it out. you could be dealing with a hematoma -- a blood clot in the tissue that could compress a nerve or cause some other problem. (not to be confused with deep venous thrombosis which is something different entirely. ) you can start with a visit to your primary health care provider. he or she may order an x-ray or ct scan of your triceps to see if there's a hematoma hiding in the tissue of your arm. if there is your doctor may wait to see if the body successfully cleans up the excess blood cells. otherwise a minor procedure may be required to remove the knot. usually these types of big bruises heal up with no treatment at all. however given that you're still noticing a lump two months after the injury it doesn't hurt to have it checked out. wishing you well!	i hit my tricep and after 2 months the lump is still there should i be concerned? . i banged it pretty bad in a minor car accident and all the bruising has went away but the lump didn't and is still a little painful.
the income used to figure out if you are eligible for a subsidy is your modified adjusted gross income (magi). that means your household income after deductions and other credits. for most people magi will be the same as adjusted gross income or agi. you can find your agi on line 4 if you file taxes on a 1040 ez form line 22 on form 1040a and line 38 on form 1040.	there are two different definitions of wages. the federal and state of florida. . unemployment insurance in florida counts dividends and wages as wages. this is unlike the federal government that splits the two. so what is our wages when determining your subsidy for health insurance?

"whenever you have a question about medications remember you can always call a pharmacist. they truly are the drug experts and are always happy to answer your questions. plus you usually can reach one at any time of the day or night. assuming you're an otherwise healthy adult with no known drug allergies then you should be able to safely take an antihistamine (such as diphenhydramine) along with flonase sudafed and amoxicillin. flonase is a steroid nasal spray designed to help relieve allergy symptoms by shrinking inflamed tissue. sudafed is a decongestant which helps dry up excessive secretions. amoxicillin is an antibiotic. be sure to take all of your amoxicillin prescription. do not stop taking it just because you start feeling better. it's very important to take all of your antibiotic pills on the prescribed schedule. do not ""save"" any antibiotics for future use. this type of behavior contributes to the development of bacteria that resist treatment by antibiotics. i hope this helps!"	i can take an antihistamine or any medicine while using flonase amoxicillin and sudafed

you are most likely better off purchasing a medigap policy than purchasing a full medical policy through the marketplace. medigap policies are designed to wrap around medicare coverage and fill in the gaps in coverage. to get help finding a medigap policy you can contact your local state health insurance assistance program ( <link> ). there is nothing to prevent you from purchasing a policy on the marketplace but you would not qualify for a premium subsidy because you already have medicare and it may not be the best policy for you given you have other coverage.	can a marketplace plan be used as a supplemental policy with medicare as the primary?
this is due to your circulation (or lack of). during cold weather the body will set priorities making sure that warm rich blood makes it to your brain and vital organs. the fingers toes and nose are often sacrificed to make sure those other organs remain warm and functioning. people who smoke tend to have peripheral circulation issues so they tend to get cold fingers more often. raynaud's syndrome is another possibility for cold white digits. cold weather or not.	why do my fingers turn white & get numb in cold weather?
it depends on the degree of damage to the scalp. if you had a severe chemical burn there is a chance that it may not grow back. however if the bald spot resulted from traumatic pulling or friction -- such as from a hairpiece or a hair clip -- the hair may grow back just fine. see your dermatologist for intralesional injections of triamcinolone to help it regrow sooner. topical minoxidil may also help it regrow.	is it true that once you develop a bald spot due to some kind of damage the hair can never grow back on its own?

hi. thanks for the query. first of all if the thrush is still present you should get treated for it with antifungal medications oral as well as topical. secondly the symptoms of slight stinging and burning can be due to recurring uti or can be related to renal stones. an ultrasound as well as urine culture should be done so that appropriate treatment can be advised to you for complete eradication of problem. as of now drink plenty of water. hope this information helps. regards.

there are physicians certified in addiction medicine at county and state facilities who are able to offer assistance at very reasonable rates for residents. you can check on this via the american society of addiction medicine: www. asam. org. in addition you can also research where 12 step meetings are held and attend or call the listed number to ask for help. if you find out that you will be responsible for paying the cost of drug detox treatment and/or rehab do not let that discourage you from getting help. talk to the detox facility and/or rehab to see if they offer any discounts or scholarships. it could be you qualify for a special program. another option for covering the cost is to see if the detox center (rehab) works with a finance company or can recommend a finance company that other patients have worked with to cover the balance. sometimes this is a good option because it will allow you to spread the balance out over several months. many facilities offer a considerable discount to patients who are able to pay cash up front as well. asking all these questions could land you some nice discounts and an more affordable rate for your budget. if you find a facility that is highly recommended to you - don't be afraid to tell them how much you want to receive their service. the seemingly most inexpensive route is a government funded detox or rehab. government funded means that the program is funded by state and federal money. as for how much drug detox and/or rehab costs for these programs it is possible to pay a few hundred dollars and under and in some cases they are of no cost – depending of funding. traditional hospital detox (or rehab) may cost from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand depending on how much funding they receive from the government or outside agencies. although there are some luxury high-end private detox facilities and rehabs where the cost can start at $10 000 per day – it is also important to know that some private treatments may cost about $1 000 per day and offer some extra amenities. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	what resources are available for treating drug addiction if you don’t have insurance?

i'm sorry you're going through this and hope you feel better soon. i strongly advise you see your primary care provider as soon as possible to diagnose what is going on. it could simply be that you're young and working a lot and don't have time to eat. or it could be a symptom of a larger condition that needs to be treated. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose something like this from the internet. you need a physical exam and possibly some blood work to find out what's going on. you deserve to be treated if appropriate and live a full life. age 22 should be the prime of your life! i hope this helps.	as of lately i noticed a sudden weight lost(13lbs) i am always tired/sleeping even after sleeping a great amount. i am a petite 22 year old female. i never had such issues until recently. i sleep great amounts and yet i still feel very tired. especially when i do eat. i lost a total of 13lbs and i have no idea how. sometimes i do not even have an appetite. i also noticed a slight numb feeling on my right toe. at night i have trouble sleeping as well.
medicines usually are the treatment of choice for ulcerative colitis. they control or prevent inflammation in the intestines and help: relieve symptoms. promote healing of damaged tissues. put the disease into remission and keep it from flaring up again. postpone or prevent the need for surgery. medication choices the choice of medicine usually depends on the severity of the disease the part of the colon affected and whether complications are present. treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis often begins with aminosalicylates (such as sulfasalazine or mesalamine). aminosalicylates relieve inflammation in the intestines and help the disease go into remission. they may also keep the disease from becoming active again. corticosteroids may be added if symptoms continue. corticosteroids relieve inflammation in the intestines. for severe cases stronger treatment with medicines that suppress the immune system (such as azathioprine [aza] 6-mercaptopurine [6-mp] or cyclosporine ) infliximab ( remicade ) and intravenous (iv) corticosteroids may be needed. if you are pregnant talk to your doctor about which medicines are safe for you to take. usually aminosalicylates and corticosteroids are safe especially when your doctor thinks that ulcerative colitis is more dangerous to the fetus than these medicines. ask your doctor whether you can take medicines that suppress the immune system. these are used only when the benefit outweighs the potential harm to the fetus. a doctor can recommend medicines based on the stage of the pregnancy and the severity of your symptoms. several studies have shown that the nicotine patch may help treat active ulcerative colitis. it is not yet known how long the benefits of the nicotine patch last or if the patch can help prevent flare-ups of ulcerative colitis. if the patch works it most likely benefits people whose symptoms began or became worse after quitting smoking. but due to the addictive power and other harmful effects of nicotine most doctors still prefer to use traditional medicines to treat ulcerative colitis before trying the nicotine patch. what to think about aminosalicylates are the most common medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis. most of the time these medicines are all a person needs to keep the disease in remission (a period of time with no symptoms). when aminosalicylates do not work corticosteroids are most often the next medicine tried. corticosteroids will only be used long enough to stop the inflammation in your colon. after the inflammation goes down aminosalicylates will most likely be used to maintain remission. if aminosalicylates are not strong enough to keep you in remission or if corticosteroids don't work your doctor may have you try different medicines. these medicines include immunomodulators cyclosporine and infliximab. all of these medicines control the immune response in your body and will decrease the amount of inflammation in your intestine. the inflammation is what causes the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat ulcerative colitis?
dehydration probably won't cause this symptom but many other conditions can. usually the cause of the hands and/or feet and legs turning blue isn't serious -- unless there are other symptoms involved such as shortness of breath or a fever. depending on a person's skin color the extremities sometimes can look quite blue. this is true of very fair-skinned people. i'd suggest your daughter get checked out for this. there are a few disorders that can cause this blueness of the extremities. sometimes these disorders actually point to other conditions that can be treated or should be watched as your daughter ages. i wish you both all the best!	will dehydration cause you skin to look blue. my 17 yr daughters hands and leg will turn blue. but it goes away after a while. will dehydration cause this. it started about 5 to 7 days ago.

1. depression may be inherited from family members. the more family you have that are depressed the more likely you will be. perhaps genetics is to blame for about 30% of depression where stress family upbringing trauma and personality style is the other 70%. 2. you may inherit genes for depression. you can also inherit the ability to respond to certain medicines that other family members respond too. so if your dad responded well to prozac your chances are good too as you likely have the same type of 'genetic' depression which was reversed by prozac in your dad. doctors should ask you if you have had a family history of depression and what meds your family took and their response to it.	can you inherit depression from your parents?

it is important to rest the stomach and yet still avoid dehydration. clear fluids should be attempted for the first 24 hours of an illness and then the diet should be advanced as tolerated. clear fluids are easy for the stomach to absorb and include: water sports drinks clear broths popsicles jello. it is important not to take too much fluid at one time since stretching the stomach may cause the nausea to worsen. one to two ounces of fluid at a time taken every 10 to 15 minutes may be all that the stomach will be able to tolerate. milk products should be avoided for the first 24 to 48 hours during an episode of nausea and vomiting. the enzyme that helps digest milk is located in cells lining the stomach. with vomiting the body can become relatively lactose intolerant. abdominal pain bloating vomiting and diarrhea may occur.	what can i do at home for nausea or vomiting?

it is possible that insurers will cover medications for off-label use. medicare for example has expanded its coverage of off-label drug use of cancer drugs. generally you would need to provide a compelling medical reason for the need backed by some scientific evidence of the drug's effectiveness and a lack of other treatment options. always check with your insurer about its rules for gaining approval for medications. and in such cases you would definitely need the participation of your doctor who will need to write a letter explaining your condition and why the medication in question is required. as far as finding information about medications being used for ailments other than those for which they've obtained fda approval you might try clinicaltrials. gov a clearinghouse of clinical trials maintained by the national institutes of health. you can also search medical journal articles that support the treatment’s use by searching pubmed a service of the u. s. national library of medicine at www. pubmed. gov.	is it possible for an insurance company to cover a medication to treat something other than the initial use? . how can one find out if medications are being tried for ailments other than the conditions approved by the fda?

surgery is indicated in a small group of children. it usually takes the failure of two or three anti-epileptic medications before a child would be considered as a potential candidate for surgery. in general this happens at least after two or three years of continuous treatment with medications. the failure might be due: to a resistance to the anti-epileptic medications that are available. to the presence of intolerable side effects to the anti-epileptic medication. to a combination of both. since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with anti-epileptic medications surgery should be considered. young age is not a contraindication for surgery and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. in fact there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. there is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain that helps with the recovery of functions that can be damaged at the time of surgery. this plasticity is higher in younger than in older children.	who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?

ultimately all hernias are caused by a combination of pressure and an opening or weakness of muscle or fascia: the pressure pushes an organ or tissue through the opening or weak spot. sometimes the muscle weakness is present at birth; more often it occurs later in life. poor nutrition smoking and overexertion all can weaken muscles and make hernias more likely. anything that causes an increase in pressure in the abdomen can then cause a hernia including obesity lifting heavy objects diarrhea or constipation or persistent coughing or sneezing.	what causes hernia?

severe psychological events can potentially cause hallucinations but i think it's rather uncommon for a panic attack to do so. it would not be impossible however for you to have the panic attack first and the hallucination to begin afterwards. it's possible that you simply noticed the visual disturbance before the physical sensation of being afraid and that coming down from the panic left you physically or emotionally tired. i would recommend that you tell someone if this happens again since a lot of other things can cause hallucinations. it's possible that this was an isolated incident but it never hurts to be sure <positive_smiley>	can panic attacks cause hallucinations? . i'm a 15 year old girl and i've always had anxiety but never any panic attacks. last night however i was sitting alone in my sunroom when a large shadow seemed to begin growing before my eyes. it kept growing and i got so terrified. i have never been that scared before. it was true fear in the pit of my stomach. my body was trembling and i could barely move. my heart was racing and i was sweating. i eventually calmed myself by singing. once i was calm i felt very very tired. what was this?
no. the hepatitis c virus is transmitted from person primarily though not exclusively in blood products primarily by the transfer of blood between intravenous drug abusers who share needles. in blood -- inside or out of the body -- the virus can live for weeks months and even years. that is why hepatitis c was a problem related to blood transfusion until tests were developed to diagnose its presence in blood so that persons or units of blood for transfusion that were infected with the virus could be detected.	is it true that the hepatitis c virus cannot survive for more than two hours outside the human body?

first if you haven't already tried to objectively talk to him about his height for weight match start there. at 7 maybe showing him a growth chart (check on the cdc. gov website) and plotting his height weight bmi <link> and show him where he fits relative to the healthiest zones (for bmi between 5-85%iles is the lowest risk). second maybe there is some teasing going on at school or in the neighborhood that is giving him this inaccurate body image. societal and cultural pressures beyond the schoolyard and neighborhood might be at play as well. media messages about physical appearance are everywhere and are capable of influencing kids this young. we sure don't want the heathy eating and activity message to turn into an unhealthy drive for thinness. lastly could there be something more? maybe. if you can't seem to make any headway on changing your son's concerns about himself then maybe a check up with your doctor can be a way to see if there is something more.	how do i handle my 7 year old son that not only thinks he is fat (only 44 lbs) but also thinks that he is ugly?
first you have to check urine for pregnancy. the pregnancy test will be positive from the next day after the missed periods. so you should get two lines if pregnant now. once confirmed have a scan to confirm the location of pregnancy. mtp (medical termination of pregnancy) kit will dislodge the pregnancy if it is intrauterine. so its location has to be confirmed whether inside uterus or not. unfortunately if it is in the tube then management is different. once intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed then you can use mtp kit any day sequentially. it is most effective up to 12 weeks of pregnancy earlier lesser the bleeding. you have a lot of time so do not be in a hurry. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My last period came before 43 days. When can I use MTP kit?
most helpful answer you're right: since the duchess of cambridge was admitted to the hospital with hyperemesis gravidarum (hg) everyone's been asking what it really is. hyperemesis gravidarum literally means excessive (hyper) vomiting (emesis) due to pregnancy (gravidarum). many women get morning sickness -- nausea and/or vomiting -- in the early stages of pregnancy so a lot of people are asking why kate middleton had to be hospitalized for what amounts to a bad case of morning sickness. hyperemesis gravidarum however is a serious medical condition. a woman with hg may lose as much as 5% of her total body weight due to fluid loss. this can not only put the baby at risk but can cause electrolyte imbalances in the mother that can lead to a heart attack. fortunately hg is a very rare condition. most women never have morning sickness that reaches the level of hg. the duchess of cambridge was simply unlucky in this respect. hope that explains things for you.	what is hyperemesis gravidarum and is it similar or different to anything. basically having a hard time founding any useful info regarding all of this. besides what i have found regarding morning sickness nausea vomiting. especially in light that catherine (kate middleton) duchess of cambridge is currently suffering from it.

this is a difficult question to answer as it will all depend on how things go. your friend may need to change some things initially during the recovery period. however there is a very good chance that she will have no long lasting effects from the surgery (though this somewhat depends on what part of the colon is going to be removed). i would recommend that your friend talk to her surgeon to be sure she knows what to look out for.	my friend is facing removal of about two feet of her colon and i was wondering what she can expect afterward?
phentermine is a central nervous system appetite suppressant. it has properties similar to an amphetamine. this medication is generally prescribed for a period not to exceed 2-3 weeks to control weight gain along with diet and exercise. your yo-yo results may be a result of taking the medication over a 5 week period. you may also be experiencing a counter-intuitive side-effect of having increased hunger. at any rate the doctor who prescribed the medication should be contacted. you should not attempt to increase decrease or stop phentermine by yourself as serious side-effects symptoms may occur. here is the positive news: during the last 10 years your weight was pretty constant at 150 lbs. to 155 lbs. based upon having a medium built along with your sex height and age the range of ideal weight for you should be 126lbs. to 154 lbs. the suggested mean weight for you is 140 lbs. that tells me that you were doing well with your weight prior to becoming injured. here are my suggestions: talk with your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program. in order to maintain your current weight of 170 lbs. your average calorie intake is about 2300 per day. i recommend that you cut back on your daily calorie intake by 500 calories. taking in 1800 calories per day will result in 1 pound per week weight loss. the 1800 calories should be divided as follows: protein- 15% or 270 calories carbohydrates- 55% or 991 calories and fats- 30% or 539 calories. losing 1 pound per week is safe and will result in a 20 pound weight loss within 5 months. by combining some moderate exercise with your diet you’ll be back to your more typical weight of 150 pounds before you know it. you may lose weight quicker by reducing your calories to 1400 calories per day and by increasing your exercise routine. to be safe and effective i recommend not skipping meals or reducing your daily calories below 1300. the internet is loaded with 1800 daily calorie menus that are nutritious filling include snacks and contain varied and delicious foods. some of these menus even come with a weekly shopping list of necessary food and ingredients along with recipes for the main courses. dieting can be more fulfilling when shared with another person. see if a friend or family member will join you in your weight loss program. reward yourself for weight losses by having your hair or nails done.	how to get off of diet pills? . i've been on phentermine for 5 weeks now. it has been a no eat binge eat exercise it off bad cycle. 1 day i'll eat 400 calories next day binge eat everything next day try to exercise for 2 hours or more? . how do i get off this nightmare? suggestions how to eat? afraiid to get even bigger. current weight 170ish @ 5'8. last 10 year weight 150 to 155. last 8 months didn't run injury and weight went out of control. help! i'm 43 year old woman.
hi i recently had the same thing happen to me. stress can do crazy things to our bodies such as missing a period which is what has happened here since your body was on a crazy schedule.	is it normal that my period is late? almost 8 days now. i've never had sex so i can't be pregnant. i'm 16 and i'm always regular. it was ramadan recently. so i fasted. and my sleeping pattern kind of messed up. i went to sleep at 4 am and woke up at 3 pm like the whole month. but before that i've always went to sleep at like 11 pm. plus i ate a lot less. everyone says i've lost weight. and i don't know if i should be worried or not. i'd reaaaaaaally appreciate your help.

first we have to talk about prevention. we can protect skin from ultraviolet light externally by using a sunblock. but you can do things like not smoking. smoking damages the elastin that helps keep facial skin flexible. sleep is important in making sure skin gets proper rest to heal itself. skin cells turn over at a rapid rate and they need time to replenish and rebuild. as for foods or nutrients that reverse aging vitamin a is certainly one of those and it comes from a variety of sources. carrots apricots nectarines sweet potatoes egg yolks [and] even some green things like spinach and broccoli. collards are a great source of vitamin a. vitamin d -- your skin converts sun into vitamin d but a lot of people have this sun phobia. you can get vitamin d from fortified foods like orange juice and milk. research is showing that the lowly mushroom is also packed with vitamin d. vitamin c is critical for wound repair -- for any type of tissue maintenance -- and that applies to your skin. tomatoes citrus kiwi -- they're all great sources. it is not necessary that every formulation gives the same effect just because these are intended for a same purpose. there are some anti-aging cream reviews that can let you know about some effective results these creams are able to produce. click here to know more details anti aging cream click here to know more details ==>> <link> i guess they can help. i am 79 years old and often asked what my secret is. people say i don't look my age. i only have one secret. i don't use any fancy skin creams just a moisturizer because my skin is dry. my secret? smile. especially when you look at yourself in the mirror. give that person the best welcoming smile you can come up with. that is your best friend sometimes your only friend. a smile makes you feel better and look younger. try it. it doesn't cost a thing. smile!	can food and nutrients reverse the aging process?
pcips which went into effect last july were set up to extend coverage for the medically uninsurable. the plans -- which cover primary and specialty care hospitalization prescription drugs and preventive care at 100% -- are intended to function as a bridge until 2014 when insurers can no longer deny coverage even to those who are sick. here is what's different about these plans: looser requirements: the requirement that you must demonstrate that you've been denied by insurers before applying has been lifted. that's a big deal and saves both time and money for people interested in applying. lower cost: the federal government runs the pcip program in 23 states and washington d. c. in most of those places the plans will become more affordable. the amount of premium cuts will vary by state with some slashing prices by as much as 40%. you can check the government's web site to see what prices are where you live. state flexibility: there are 27 states that run their own pcip program which have been granted the option by the federal government to reduce premium costs as well. check with your state's health department or pcip (visit pcip. gov or call 866-717-5826). unfortunately what's not different is the requirement that you are uninsured for six months in order to qualify for coverage. for information about how to sign up for a pcip plan visit pcip. gov or call 866-717-5826.	what are pre-existing condition insurance plans (pcip)?

most cases of female infertility are caused by problems with ovulation. without ovulation there are no eggs to be fertilized. some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods. ovulation problems are often caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). pcos is a hormone imbalance problem which can interfere with normal ovulation. pcos is the most common cause of female infertility. primary ovarian insufficiency (poi) is another cause of ovulation problems. poi occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. poi is not the same as early menopause. less common causes of fertility problems in women include: blocked fallopian tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease endometriosis or surgery for an ectopic pregnancy physical problems with the uterus uterine fibroids which are non-cancerous clumps of tissue and muscle on the walls of the uterus.	what causes infertility in women?

a hernia is an opening or weakness in the muscular structure of the wall of the abdomen. this defect causes a bulging of the abdominal wall. this bulging is usually more noticeable when the abdominal muscles are tightened thereby increasing the pressure in the abdomen. any activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure can worsen a hernia; examples of such activities are lifting coughing or even straining to have a bowel movement. imagine a barrel with a hole in its side and a balloon that is blown up inside the barrel. part of the inflated balloon would bulge out through the hole. the balloon going through the hole is like the tissues of the abdomen bulging through a hernia. serious complications from a hernia can result from the trapping of tissues in the hernia -- a process called incarceration. trapped or incarcerated tissues may have their blood supply cut off leading to damage or death of the tissue. the treatment of an incarceration usually involves surgery.	what is a hernia?

if the symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least two weeks you should schedule a visit with his or her doctor to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to make sure that your child receives proper treatment. a consultation with a mental healthcare professional who specializes in children is also recommended. a mental health evaluation should include interviews with you (as the parents) and your child and any additional psychological testing that is necessary. information from teachers friends and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. there are no specific tests -- medical or psychological -- that can clearly show depression but tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents) combined with personal information can be very useful.	how is depression diagnosed in children?

well this is an interesting question. i'm not sure there's a straightforward answer because i'm not sure anyone has studied this. here's what we know: smoking around infants and children can cause them to inhale second-hand smoke which may be linked to higher rates of certain lung problems like asthma. we also know second-hand smoke contains harmful chemicals and that this smoke (containing chemicals) can settle on surfaces such as clothing draperies countertops and so on. will coming in contact with this potentially toxic material on someone's shirt (or fingertips) cause problems for your baby? my guess (and it's strictly a guess! ) is probably not. if this were the case the entire baby boomer generation would probably exhibit symptoms because nearly all of our relatives smoked and held babies at the same time. you can reduce any possible risk by gently wiping off your baby with a damp cloth after he or she has been cuddled by someone you believe has tobacco smoke residue on their clothing or hands. you probably don't need to be overly aggressive about this. don't scrub the little one's skin off. but a simple swipe should do the trick. hope this helps!	can cigarettes smoke stain clothing and/or skin with chemicals or toxins harmful to a newborn baby? . i am wondering if anyone who smokes and then holds or is around my newborn can cause any harm from anything on their clothing or skin.

good nutrition is important for strong bones and muscles. for people with lupus bone health is a particular concern. that’s because medications used to treat it can increase the risk for osteoporosis a condition in which the bones become less dense and break easily. eating foods high in calcium and vitamin d is important for bone health. when buying dairy products choose ones that are either low-fat or fat-free. good choices include: 1% or skim milk low-fat low-sodium yogurt low-fat cheese if you cannot drink milk good alternatives include: lactose-free milk soy milk almond milk juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin d dark green vegetables are another source of calcium. if you don’t get enough calcium in your diet your doctor will probably recommend a calcium supplement.	i have lupus. how can i maintain good bone health?
"osteoporosis can be present without any symptoms for decades because osteoporosis doesn't cause symptoms until bone fractures. moreover some osteoporotic fractures may escape detection for years when they do not cause symptoms. therefore patients may not be aware of their osteoporosis until they suffer a painful fracture. the symptom associated with osteoporotic fractures usually is pain; the location of the pain depends on the location of the fracture. the symptoms of osteoporosis in men are similar to the symptoms of osteoporosis in women. fractures of the spine (vertebra) can cause severe ""band-like"" pain that radiates from the back to the sides of the body. over the years repeated spinal fractures can lead to chronic lower back pain as well as loss of height and/or curving of the spine due to collapse of the vertebrae. the collapse gives individuals a hunched-back appearance of the upper back often called a ""dowager hump"" because it commonly is seen in elderly women. a fracture that occurs during the course of normal activity is called a minimal trauma or stress fracture. for example some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while walking or stepping off a curb. hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. with osteoporosis hip fractures can occur as a result of trivial accidents. hip fractures also may heal slowly or poorly after surgical repair because of poor healing of the bone."	what are osteoporosis symptoms and signs?

i don't know if you are a teen boy or girl but there are many things that can be done to control acne. acne is mostly caused by your raging hormones and those hormones are doing some very important things right now. you need them. consider acne an unavoidable side-effect. acne is temporary but it can last years. improperly treated or managed your acne can leave permanent scars so i would recommend that you see a dermatologist. yes some topical acne medications cause dryness and other temporary skin changes. you must learn to tolerate them for the greater benefit that can be achieved by remaining on them. i don't know what you have tried but under the careful eye of a trained medical professional i am confident that you can find the right medication regime that can achieve the optimum results. many teens expect too much; too soon when under acne treatment. they want a blemish-free face overnight and this does not happen. it can take months or a year or more of treatment to control acne. only getting older will cure your acne and unfortunately many adults will still get it. don't be frustrated. you are not alone and many of the adults around you were struggling when they were teens as well. the advantage you have now is that there are effective treatments. all we basically had when we were teens was soap!	why can't i get rid of my acne? . i've tried neutrogena clean & clear & prescriptions. all of them were either too strong made my skin dry out mad my skin peel made my acne worse or were too expensive. i don't know what else to do.

we are used to thinking about the telltale signs of heart attacks based upon many years of research and clinical observation of what men have experienced -- chest discomfort arm and back pain and shortness of breath top the list. but more recently doctors and their patients are recognizing that women may experience heart attacks differently. women may certainly experience chest pain but they should also be on the lookout for less obvious symptoms like nausea indigestion and palpitations in addition to shortness of breath and back pain. in fact nearly half of the women in one study had no chest pain at all during their heart attack. fatigue and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. whereas chest pain shortness of breath and fatigue are the most typical symptoms for men these heart attack warning signs for women should be considered carefully.	what is the difference between men's and women's heart attack symptoms?

yes. a doctor can take a sample from what appears to be a herpes sore and examine it under a microscope. you can also have a blood test. the blood test looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system would have made when you were infected. hsv-2 almost always infects the genitals so if antibodies to hsv-2 are detected in your blood you probably have genital herpes. a blood test that shows antibodies to hsv-1 means you could have genital or oral herpes. that's because oral herpes typically caused by hsv-1 can be spread to the genitals during oral sex.	is there a test for genital herpes?

I really want to see a doctor, but I want to give my parents some explanation since they do not really understand how bad mental illness can be. Thank you.

"most helpful answer what kind of medication? you may have a common case of balanitis due to yeast or even a bacterial infection but unfortunately this would take an examination to definitively determine -- not something that can be accomplished over the internet. see your medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed and treated. sounds like you have an infection due to the ""white stuff"" which is actually called smegma. smegma is bacteria and needs to be cleaned out every day. wash it out thoroughly with soap and water. after it's dry apply an antibacterial penis health creme called man1 man oil. this will help you keep the area extra clean and should stave-off future infections. good luck. well well the late seanhh is here with his snake cream again 2 years late well done keep it up perhaps one day your get it right just one day. don't forget guys baby oil is just as good and way way cheaper and works just as good. hi did your mother not teach you to wash under your foreskin daily its something all guys should do and if you can straight after sex always well you never know what's going to happen next with your lover may want to give you oral sex see you should always keep your penis clean. doing all the above no guys will get balanitis its something you just don't want. if your foreskin is tight just try some simple stretching side ways and length ways just use some baby oil it will help by doing this you will loosen your foreskin so it will move up and down more freely. hope this helps you. good luck"	can medication cause problems with the penis? . penis is red swollen and painful. uncircumcised so foreskin is sore and is hard to return to cover head of penis there is some white matter under the foreskin and it is very painful to wash the area.

For some time now, probably 6 months or more, I also began feeling that my legs were heavy and just general weakness all over, not really muscle weakness. I am also a gastric bypass patient and have a history of low B12, iron saturation and low vitamin D. To complicate matters even more, I went to an orthopedic spine specialist about a month ago, due to the stiffness in my neck. I was unable to turn side to side and this has been going on for several years, like 5 or more. Also, I have a sharp pain between my shoulder blades. My cervical MRI shows moderate facet joint arthritis, small central spur on C5-C6 and some compression of the spinal cord. Even more complicated is that the MRI showed thyroid nodules and the ultrasound reported as typical of a multinodular goiter. My TSH was 4.18.I visited my family doctor and he said that the twitches were probably from low vitamin B12. He gave me an injection yesterday and took blood to measure B12 and vitamin D. My vitamin B12 is more than 2000 and vitamin D is 9. I am going insane thinking that I have some horrible neurological disorder with the twitches and tingling in my calves, general fatigue and heavy feeling of my legs when I walk. My primary care physician did a strength test on arms and legs and said it was normal. Can low vitamin B12 and vitamin D cause these symptoms? I just feel weird and scared.

there has been ongoing controversy surrounding certain childhood vaccines and their relationship to autism. many studies have looked at whether there is a link between autism and vaccines. to date there is no convincing evidence that any vaccine can cause autism. a suspected link between the measles mumps rubella (mmr) vaccine and autism has been suggested by some parents of children with autism. typically symptoms of autism are first noted by parents as their child begins to have difficulty with delays in speaking after age 1. around this same time the mmr vaccine is first given to children. therefore autism cases with an apparent onset within a few weeks after the mmr vaccination may simply be an unrelated chance occurrence. parents have also questioned whether mercury-containing thimerosal (used as a preservative in vaccines) might cause autism. today with the exception of some influenza vaccines vaccines used in the united states to protect preschool-aged children contain reduced or no thimerosal as a preservative. (influenza vaccine is currently available both with thimerosal as a preservative and preservative-free. ) according to the cdc there is no convincing scientific evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. more importantly studies have not found a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. because the exact cause of autism is not known parents may continue to have concerns despite the evidence. in these cases parents should be aware of the risks of serious disease in children who are not vaccinated. in some areas outbreaks of these dangerous diseases have occurred in people who have not been immunized. understanding the ruling on autism-like symptoms and vaccines in a recent controversy a georgia girl was entitled to compensation after developing autism-like symptoms after receiving five childhood vaccines in 2000. but what does this decision mean to your child and to other children? it's important to note that the government has not said that childhood vaccines actually cause autism. rather the division of vaccine injury compensation (dvic) at the department of health and human services agreed there is a possibility that the vaccines aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder in this young girl. the mitochondrial disorder manifested as a regressive neurological disease with some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. understandably many parents are worried about the risks that are feared to accompany vaccinations. ever since the first vaccines were developed there have been risks. most vaccine side effects are mild and severe ones are extremely rare. but the use of vaccines in children has essentially eradicated a number of major childhood diseases that kill. when parents fail to vaccinate their children the risk of serious -- even deadly -- disease epidemics extends beyond them and their families to their neighborhoods and communities. failure to vaccinate lays the foundation for new epidemics that could result in serious harm to your child. for instance a decline in vaccination rates in some european countries has led to fatal outbreaks of measles. in short whereas advocacy groups against childhood vaccines continue to take issue with immunizations cdc officials maintain that this recent ruling should not be generalized to the risk of vaccines for all children. in a statement the american academy of pediatrics reinforced its dedication to the health of all children and urges parents to fully immunize their children.	can childhood vaccines cause autism?
the lack of intimacy can be very complicated so i think it would be good to address the issue as a couple during one of her counseling sessions. you may need to convince her to do this. the cause could be related to her depression of course but can also be related to her self-image. many antidepressant medications can affect libido so a review of her medications may be in order perhaps changing some of them to a type that does not have sexual side effects. you and your wife can rediscover sexual intimacy again but it may take time patience and some sexual counseling. don't give up on her or be frustrated. this can be fixed.

diet is not the only factor that increases blood sugar. if you don't have diabetes your blood sugar will be tightly controlled either by increasing insulin to combat high carb intake or utilizing stored forms from the liver and muscles to be put back into the blood stream. so even though you take in little carbohydrates your body will aim to keep levels within a normal range. when the diet remains low in carbohydrates and the stored sources run low the body then turns fat into glucose but this also produces ketones which can have unpleasant side effects. don't forget your brain needs glucose! according to the institute of medicine individuals need 130g of carbohydrate for the brain to run efficiently. i would check with your healthcare provider or registered dietitian for the appropriate diet for your condition. if you have diabetes it's best to see a diabetes educator to help with any changes in diet as medication is also likely to change.	am blood sugar 86 - ate water 4 hamburger patties 1/4 c almonds 1/4 c cashews 1/4 cup plain yogurt next am 99 how? . i have candida and have been monitoring my blood sugar to ensure it doesn't go too high and further my problems. i don't understand how i can go from blood sugar of 86 one morning to 99 the next when i had no more than 31 carbs all day. please help me understand where i'm making my mistake. . water = carb free. 4 hamburger patties = (<1 each). 1/4 cup cashews = 8 carbs. 1/4 cup almonds = 8 carbs. 2 tblsp plain yogurt = 11 carbs in a cup

the simple answer : osteoporosis is the demineralization or thinning of bone often seen as people age. this can make them more prone to fractures (breaks) from even minor injuries or no injuries at all. scoliosis is a term pertaining to an abnormal curvature of the spine often first detected at puberty in both boys and girls however if an older person had osteoporosis of the spine this could cause an abnormal curvature (scoliosis). so a person could have both. for more a detailed explanation of these two terms a search of webmd's massive data bank will reveal several different articles and citations for each of them. osteoporosis makes your bone brittle due to lack of calcium nutrition and even aging. scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine often first detected at puberty in both boys and girls. osteoporosis may lead to scoliosis.	what is the difference between osteoporosis and scoliosis?

rh sensitization can occur when a person with rh-negative blood is exposed to rh-positive blood. about 90% of women who become sensitized do so during childbirth when their blood mixes with the rh-positive blood of their fetus. 1 once exposed a mother's immune system produces antibodies against rh-positive red blood cells. for more information about events and procedures that can put you at high risk for rh sensitization see the what increases your risk section of this topic. the minimum amount of blood mixing necessary to cause sensitization is not known. but many women become sensitized during pregnancy or childbirth after being exposed to as little as of rh-positive fetal blood. 1 fortunately rh sensitization can almost always be prevented with the rh immune globulin injection. when an rh-negative person's immune system is first exposed to rh-positive blood it takes several weeks to develop immunoglobulin m or igm antibodies. igm antibodies are too large to cross the placenta. so the rh-positive fetus that first triggers maternal sensitization is usually not harmed. a previously rh-sensitized immune system rapidly reacts to rh-positive blood as during a second pregnancy with an rh-positive fetus. usually within hours of rh-positive blood exposure smaller immunoglobulin g or igg antibodies are formed. igg antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. this causes rh disease which is dangerous for the fetus. some rh-negative people never become sensitized even after exposure to large amounts of rh-positive blood. the reason for this is not known. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes rh sensitization during pregnancy?

this is a great question. so many consumers and patients are coming with these type of products to the counter and saying hey can you help me figure out if this is right for me. once again this is an over-the-counter product they are usually in the vitamin and herbal section. we have limited data on whether or not they work. we don't know what they are active ingredients sometimes are. so we want to make sure that patients are really careful about this. one of the things encountering in the diet area is the fact that people who have cardiac conditions or high blood pressure these may not be the right choices for them. once again the physician or healthcare provider needs to see this and evaluate you based on that first before we go and choose any over-the-counter supplement. people might think oh it's just something minor because i just feel like i gained a few pounds of water weight. but that can make a really big difference especially if you have high blood pressure or certain lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd all these things kind of come into play. so i really want consumers and patients to understand that we know these products are out there but we want to make sure we make the right choices and education is the best way to go. so ask a question first. and find out if it's the right product for you. they could have an adverse reaction. the other thing is too is that sometimes they contain byproducts that people that may have allergic reactions to; a filler or a salt or a particular root that they found. like a lot of them come with more natural products like leaves or roots from trees and a lot of people are starting to break out from those because they have never been exposed to them before. so once again be really careful about the choices that we are making.	are the sleeping pill fat burner combos like liponesta safe? do they work?
"well in general this is a quite common surgery with a good success rate. this surgery usually is performed to decompress spinal nerves that are being pinched by collapsed discs in the upper spine. decompressing these nerves relieves pain and can increase range of motion in the neck. that said each individual person heals differently. smoking can greatly decrease the body's ability to heal tissue well so you can help yourself by quitting smoking at least a month before the surgery. consult your surgeon before implementing any of the following suggestions but i always suggested surgical patients take some extra vitamin c and eat a little extra protein in the weeks leading up to a procedure. unless you've been prescribed vitamin e (which is rare) you can discontinue it before surgery (it is a ""blood thinner "" which means your blood may not clot well during/after surgery). you also can discontinue most herbs or supplements. in general i advised surgical patients not to take anything that wasn't prescribed by their doctor in the weeks heading up to surgery. your surgeon will have specific guidelines for you to follow though and you should abide by them. if you don't understand what your surgery entails or why it's being done (or what the success rate is) then you should have another consult with the surgeon. it's his or her job to make sure you fully understand exactly what is being done and why. keep asking questions until you do understand. don't feel rushed. wishing you well!"	what is the success rate ofcervical c5-6 c6-7 anterior partical corpectomy disctomy fusion? . what is the success rate of a cervical c5-6 c6-7 anterior partical corpectomy disctomy fusion and instrumentation operation?

"based on my experience over the years i think fm makes our muscles more susceptible to strains or tears/injuries within the muscles. also we seem to be more susceptible to getting tendinitis and bursitis. some of this may be due to certain deficiencies that we with fibro develop like low intracellular magnesium levels low muscle energy (atp) and low growth hormone levels that interfere with the protection flexibility and recovery of the muscles and soft tissues. our soft tissues may be more susceptible to the degenerative ""wear and tear"" changes we all get with aging and overuse. also our muscles act more ""deconditioned"" when we have fm which increases our chance of an injury. fm doesn't cause/aggravate disc disease or arthritis changes but the reverse situation is true. that is disc and arthritic disease can aggravate fm symptoms. i don't believe in automatically attributing any soft tissue problem to fm. in fact most of the times something else like a trauma or a degenerative problem is ""clearly"" identified as the direct cause of the tear or bursitis/tendinitis. but we can surmise that the fm probably played a secondary role in a lot of these situations. no i dont believe so"	can fibromyalgia cause muscles to tear more easily?

i'm sorry to hear you're feeling poorly. often the best initial treatment for vomiting is to avoid taking anything by mouth (including water) until the vomiting stops. then start with small sips of water to make sure you aren't going to start vomiting again. work your way up to regular food slowly. after the vomiting stops be sure to stay as well-hydrated as you can without triggering more nausea. if the vomiting is severe or doesn't clear up within a day you should seek medical attention. also if your vomiting is accompanied by other symptoms such as severe abdominal pain or head injury you should seek immediate medical attention. if you have no allergies to medication you can probably treat the vomiting and aches with over-the-counter medications. ask a pharmacist what he or she recommends. if you did not get a flu shot be aware the flu season is already underway. wash your hands frequently to avoid spreading the flu (if that's what you have) or any potentially contagious illness. hope you feel better soon!	what to take vomiting and achy feeling. started with upset stomach

there are several types of gallstones and each type has a different cause. cholesterol gallstones cholesterol gallstones are made primarily of cholesterol. they are the most common type of gallstone comprising 80% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas. cholesterol is one of the substances that liver cells secrete into bile. (secretion of cholesterol into bile is an important way in which the liver eliminates excess cholesterol from the body). in order for bile to carry cholesterol the cholesterol must be dissolved in the bile. cholesterol is a fat however and bile is an aqueous or watery solution; fats do not dissolve in watery solutions. in order to make the cholesterol dissolve in bile the liver also secretes two detergents -- bile acids and lecithin -- into the bile. these detergents just like dishwashing detergents dissolve the fatty cholesterol so that it can be carried by bile through the ducts. if the liver secretes too much cholesterol for the amount of bile acids and lecithin it secretes some of the cholesterol does not dissolve. similarly if the liver does not secrete enough bile acids and lecithin some of the cholesterol also does not dissolve. in either case the undissolved cholesterol sticks together and forms particles of cholesterol that grow in size and eventually form larger gallstones. there are two other processes that promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones though neither process is able to cause cholesterol gallstones by itself. the first is abnormally rapid formation and growth of cholesterol particles into gallstones. thus with the same concentrations of cholesterol bile acids and lecithin in their bile patients with gallstones form particles of cholesterol more rapidly than individuals without gallstones. the second process that promotes the formation and growth of gallstones is reduced contraction and emptying of the gallbladder that allows bile to sit in the gallbladder longer so that there is more time for cholesterol particles to form and grow. pigment gallstones pigment gallstones are the second most common type of gallstone. although pigment gallstones comprise only 15% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas they are more common than cholesterol gallstones in southeast asia. there are two types of pigment gallstones 1) black pigment gallstones and 2) brown pigment gallstones. pigment is a waste product formed from hemoglobin the oxygen-carrying chemical in red blood cells. the hemoglobin from old red blood cells that are being destroyed is changed into a chemical called bilirubin and released into the blood. bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver. the liver modifies the bilirubin and secretes the modified bilirubin or into bile. black pigment gallstones: if there is too much bilirubin in bile the bilirubin combines with other constituents in bile for example calcium to form pigment (so-called because it is dark brown in color). pigment dissolves poorly in bile and like cholesterol it sticks together and forms particles that grow in size and eventually form gallstones. the pigment gallstones that form in this manner are called black pigment gallstones because they are black and hard. brown pigment gallstones: if there is reduced contraction of the gallbladder or obstruction to the flow of bile through the ducts bacteria may ascend from the duodenum into the bile ducts and gallbladder. the bacteria alter the bilirubin in the ducts and gallbladder and the altered bilirubin then combines with calcium to form pigment. the pigment then combines with fats in bile (cholesterol and fatty acids from lecithin) to form particles that grow into gallstones. this type of gallstone is called a brown pigment gallstone because it is more brown than black. it also is softer than black pigment gallstones. other types of gallstones. other types of gallstones are rare. perhaps the most interesting type of gallstone is the gallstone that forms in patients taking the antibiotic ceftriaxone (rocephin). ceftriaxone is unusual in that it is eliminated from the body in bile in high concentrations. it combines with calcium in bile and becomes insoluble. like cholesterol and pigment the insoluble ceftriaxone and calcium form particles that grow into gallstones. most of these gallstones disappear once the antibiotic is stopped but they still may cause problems until they disappear. another rare type of gallstone is formed from calcium carbonate.	what causes gallstones?
baby : your baby measures about 10 inches from crown to rump or a total length of about 15. 75 inches from head to toe and weighs about 2. 4 pounds. brain waves show rapid eye movement (rem) sleep which means your baby may be dreaming. eyelids are opening. branches of lungs are developing so there's a good chance that baby would survive if born prematurely now. mom-to-be : your uterus extends well above your navel. as baby gets bigger and stronger this month you may be experiencing leg cramps and mild swelling of ankles and feet difficulty sleeping shortness of breath lower abdominal achiness clumsiness or scattered braxton hicks contractions (hardening and relaxing of the uterus like rehearsals for labor). you may also be urinating more frequently again as the uterus continues to push on your bladder. tip of the week : even if your partner is planning on being with you in the delivery room you might want to consider hiring a doula -- a professional labor assistant who provides support but not medical aid for the mother and her partner. studies show that doulas can shorten a woman's labor and reduce the likelihood of needing pain medication forceps deliveries or a caesarean section.	what can i expect during week 28 of my pregnancy?

the threat of suicide among patients with bipolar disorder is very real -- and it can occur during either the depressive or the manic state. stress as well as personal traumatic events can also increase the risk. up to 15% of people with bipolar disorder are successful in their suicide attempts -- and many more try. although treatment reduces risks friends and family members should be on the lookout for signs of impending suicide. these include talking about suicide or death; writing a suicide note; talking about feelings of hopelessness; abusing drugs or alcohol; participating in life-threatening activities. during a crisis do not leave a person with bipolar disorder alone and remove car keys weapons or large amounts of medication. call 911 for assistance.	how real is the threat of suicide in bipolar disorder -- and what can be done to reduce the risk?

most condoms are made of a type of rubber called latex. latex condoms are the most effective condom at preventing stds. recently condoms made of polyurethane (a type of plastic) have become available. these are more expensive than latex condoms and seem to break more easily. they are mainly useful for people who are allergic to latex. there are also natural condoms which are made of animal membranes (lambskin). these are expensive and although they are effective at preventing pregnancy they do not decrease the spread of many sexually transmitted diseases.	what are male condoms made of?
i think the two most important safety questions that a patient can ask the doctor is one will there be a fully accredited anesthesia specialist in attendance anesthesia specialist being either a certified registered nurse anesthetist or a physician anesthesiologist. that’s number one. second is the facility accredited? now accreditation is kind of a broad term. for instance the facility could be licensed by the state. states do that. hospitals are licensed. the state will license a facility. the federal government does the same. in other words you cannot operate on a medicare patient and expect medicare to pay for it unless they’ve given it the stamp of approval. by the way the standards are almost identical. and some facilities for whatever reason will have both the state and the federal government come in do their evaluation and asked to be approved. but there are also private credentialing companies that do this and by the way most hospitals in the united states are accredited by essentially what is called the joint commission. it’s called the joint commission on accreditation of health facilities. this licenses hospitals outpatient surgery centers radiology x-ray clinics. so again very high standards so that there is no a or b it’s all a. if you get the right answers to those questions you’ll feel comfortable. and i would tell you also parenthetically most of the doctor anesthesiologists that i know will not work in an unaccredited unlicensed facility because they would be compromised in the performance of their work. for example if the facility didn’t have all the appropriate life support systems why would the anesthesiologist want to be in the situation where if anything goes wrong he doesn’t have the technical backup. he doesn’t want to be in that position. he wants to deliver to the patient when needed if needed as remote as that possibility is he wants to deliver the best he has.	how can i be sure my cosmetic surgery will be safe?

one of the first steps in quitting smoking is to examine the different methods to become smoke free and decide which one would work best for you. some of the options include nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) such as gum or patches; prescription medication like chantix or wellbutrin; or methods like tapering postponing or cold turkey. do research beforehand to weigh the pros and cons of each method before implementing a program. next think about how ready you are to quit smoking on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being not ready to quit whatsoever and 10 being ready to quit right now. pick a number that best represents where you stand at the moment. why didn’t you pick a number that was lower? here it may help to think about the benefits that you stand to gain from quitting smoking or your reasons behind wanting to quit. what would it take for you to be higher on that scale towards a 10 then? at this point it might help to think about what you would need to become fully motivated and put your thoughts about quitting smoking into action. it’s important to develop strategies to help you be successful. what are potential barriers that may get in the way of your success and how do you plan to overcome them? it might be helpful to tell your friends your desire to quit and enlist their support in working towards your goal. no matter what don’t give up! many people have several unsuccessful attempts before they finally are able to become smoke free because quitting smoking can be an incredibly difficult thing to do for some people. the webmd smoking cessation center would be a great resource for more information and for direction on where to get more help regarding becoming smoke free. talk to your doctor for further guidance as well.	how can i stop smoking when already i'm addicted to it.? . i have stopped smoking an year ago but again smoked once due to peer pressure. but i dont want that to continue. how can i proceed. for this.?

the first step in controlling hives is to identify the cause if possible. once you have identified the source of the problem try to avoid exposure to it in the future. a mild case of hives often disappears on its own after a few hours. a longer-lasting case should respond to the manufacturer's recommended dosage of an over-the-counter oral antihistamine. if your hives don't disappear in a few days see a doctor. if you develop symptoms of angioedema or anaphylaxis get medical help immediately. for chronic or especially troublesome outbreaks of hives your doctor will probably order a course of prescription antihistamines. treatment with oral corticosteroids will sometimes reduce swelling when antihistamines don't work but they are usually reserved for more severe cases. if you have the subsurface welts of angioedema you may require hospitalization.	what are standard treatments for hives?

sometimes the scale doesn’t accurately reflect what’s really happening with your body. keep in mind that your weight can fluctuate naturally throughout the course of a day. consider if you’ve eaten used the restroom or how well hydrated you are; all of which have a physical weight to them that can influence the number on the scale. seeing a change like loss of inches can be a great indicator of progress. see if you notice a more “toned” appearance or more muscle definition as well. also check to see if your clothes fit differently such as by dropping pants sizes having to take a belt in more notches or shirts being loose or not as tight. these changes in body composition can be viewed as more favorable than actual weight loss recorded on a scale. i wholly encourage you to not just view your progress through solely what the scale shows alone. if you do weigh yourself however it may be best to limit yourself to once per week just so that you can notice any weight loss trends but not enough to where you’re obsessing over the numbers. keep the timing of when you weigh yourself the same to establish consistency probably first thing in the morning to help take away confounding variables.	what can be causing me to not see the numbers on the scale to drop but the inches are dropping? . i have incorporated a healthy diet with regular exercise i can see the changes but nothing on the scale changes. stumped

it’s the kind of headline that generates attention: “insomnia triggers men’s death kids’ mental decline. ” that’s what the latest research published in the journal sleep is showing. in one study researchers at penn state college of medicine found: * men with chronic insomnia who got less than six hours of sleep a night were four times more likely to die than those who regularly got more rest. in this 14-year study weight and smoking habits were factored into the difference. in another study this one done in australia a group of researchers looked at the link between sleep and mental illnesses among young people and discovered that: * young adults who habitually slept fewer than five hours a night were three times more likely to develop psychiatric disorders than those that got eight to nine hours of shut-eye. that’s pretty alarming. the australian researchers surveyed about 20 000 people between the ages of 17 years and 24 years over 18 months. i’ve written many times about the importance of sleep for our youth and this further confirms my recommendation. teens need at least eight-and-a-half hours of sleep a night to function best but many aren’t getting that. if you’ve got young adults in your home you’re well aware of the challenges to changing household habits around sleep. it’s long been known that the effects of sleep deprivation are deadly. sleep deprivation raises your risk for a slew of health problems including heart disease diabetes and high blood pressure. that’s the reasoning behind the increased risk of death among men who don’t get enough sleep. you have to wonder though: did their poor sleep habits begin in adolescence? they may not have grown into adults with “psychiatric disorders ” but habits typically start in one’s youth. changing the sleep habits of a young person takes a concerted effort starting with a simple conversation about the value and importance of sleep. this may not go over too well with teenagers who prefer to stay up late but as with everyone else their morning wake-up call doesn’t usually change. so to get more sleep you have to be an enforcer: * change the bedtime routine and get to bed sooner. * set limits on things like electronics television viewing and engaging in stimulating activities. * maintain sound sleep environments. this goes for children their dads and their moms. women don’t get a free pass here. they’ll be the target of another study soon enough. and the headline will read something like “sleep: live longer stay sharper be happier. ”	why is getting enough sleep so important?
heart failure is the result of poor cardiac function and is reflected by a decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart called cardiac output. heart failure can be caused by weakness of the heart muscle which pumps blood out through the arteries to the entire body or by dysfunction of the heart valves which regulate the flow of blood between the chambers of the heart. the diminished volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) is responsible for a decreased flow of blood to the kidneys. as a result the kidneys sense that there is a reduction of the blood volume in the body. to counter the seeming loss of fluid the kidneys retain salt and water. in this instance the kidneys are fooled into thinking that the body needs to retain more fluid volume when in fact the body already is holding too much fluid. this fluid increase ultimately results in the buildup of fluid within the lungs which causes shortness of breath. because of the decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) the volume of blood in the arteries is also decreased despite the actual increase in the body's total fluid volume. an associated increase in the amount of fluid in the blood vessels of the lungs causes shortness of breath because the excess fluid from the lungs' blood vessels leaks into the airspaces (alveoli) and interstitium in the lungs. this accumulation of fluid in the lung is called pulmonary edema. at the same time accumulation of fluid in the legs causes pitting edema. this edema occurs because the build-up of blood in the veins of the legs causes leakage of fluid from the legs' capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the interstitial spaces. an understanding of how the heart and lungs interact will help you to better comprehend how fluid retention works in heart failure. the heart has four chambers; an auricle and a ventricle on the left side of the heart and an auricle and ventricle on the right. the left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and transfers it to the left ventricle which then pumps it through the arteries to the entire body. the blood then is transported back to the heart by veins into the right auricle and transferred to the right ventricle which then pumps it to the lungs for re-oxygenation. left-sided heart failure which is due primarily to a weak left ventricle usually is caused by coronary artery disease hypertension or disease of the heart valves. typically when these patients initially come to the doctor they are troubled by shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down at night (orthopnea). these symptoms are due to pulmonary edema that is caused by pooling of the blood in the vessels of the lungs. in contrast right-sided heart failure which often is due to chronic lung diseases such as emphysema initially causes salt retention and edema. persistent salt retention in these patients however may lead to an expanded blood volume in the blood vessels thereby causing fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary congestion) and shortness of breath. in patients with heart failure due to weak heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) both the right and left ventricles of the heart are usually affected. these patients therefore can initially suffer from swelling both in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and in the legs and feet (peripheral edema). the physician examining a patient who has congestive heart failure with fluid retention looks for certain signs. these include: pitting edema of the legs and feet rales in the lungs (moist crackle sounds from the excess fluid that can be heard with a stethoscope) a gallop rhythm (three heart sounds instead of the normal two due to muscle weakness) and distended neck veins. the distended neck veins reflect the accumulation of blood in the veins that are returning blood to the heart.	why does a patient with heart disease retain fluid?
got a few whole wheat hamburger buns leftover from a previous dinner? here’s a recipe that will quickly transform this forgotten bread into a savory side dish for today’s lunch or dinner. garlic cheese toast complements soup stew or a green salad. you can blend together the cheese spread and have it ready in the fridge for when you are ready to broil them. i developed this recipe with gruyere cheese because i happened to have some in my refrigerator (and it’s a high flavor cheese) but you could use other cheeses and the recipe would still work well. likewise you could use whipped butter instead of a light margarine. garlic cheese toast ingredients * 2 tablespoons light margarine (i. e. smart balance light buttery spread) * 1 teaspoon fresh minced garlic * 1/3 cup shredded gruyere cheese (sharp cheddar may be substituted) * 3 whole-wheat hamburger bun halves (or similar) about 100 grams total preparation 1. in a small bowl combine margarine garlic and shredded cheese with fork until blended. 2. spread evenly on whole wheat hamburger buns. watching carefully broil bun halves in toaster oven (or regular oven) until golden brown and cheese mixture is bubbling — about 2 to 3 minutes.

typically the recommendation for dust mite and pet allergy is decreasing exposure. for dust mites this would include washing the sheets in hot water once per week keeping his bedroom vacuumed and implementing dust mite encasements for the pillow boxspring and mattress. in regard to pet allergy whether to get rid of the animals is a personal/family decision. at the least keeping the animals out of the bedroom can decrease exposure. his allergist can make more specific recommendations in the context of the severity of your son's symptoms and test results.	my son's allergy test rast score was 642. he is allergic to dogs cats and dust mites. should i get rid of the dog?

"first off let me just clarify that not everyone who takes a diuretic (""water pill"") needs to take a potassium supplement. diuretics come in two general types: potassium-sparing and non-potassium-sparing (also called ""loop diuretics""). most of the newer diuretics are potassium-sparing which means they do not strip potassium from the body the way loop diuretics do. the reason i want to clarify this is because patients who take loop diuretics like lasix (furosemide) should always receive a prescription for potassium from their doctor. if you are taking a diuretic and did not receive a prescription for potassium they you may not need to take any extra potassium. potassium is a key mineral for heart health. but too much or too little potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat. thus it's not always a good idea to take a potassium supplement. if a person wants to make sure they are getting enough potassium they should consider eating potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauces and beans. this is a safer way to get potassium than taking a pill -- unless a medical professional tells you to take a pill. wishing you well!"	how effective is the otc potassium gluconate for copd patients on diurectics?

most helpful answer you body needs about 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight (i do not know what you currently weigh). if you eat less and burn more you will lose weight. in a chronic situation where you are losing weight your body will attempt to lower your metabolic rate to compensate for this slowing down you weight loss. in addition to calories you body needs a balance of protein (more for men; less for women) fat and carbohydrates to achieve optimum health. i don't know your sex or what your goals are but it may be best to seek the counseling of a good nutritionist.	is it possible to have too few calories in a day? . the webmd food and fitness planner suggests that for my current weight and my weight loss target i should be consuming 1880 calories per day and burning 250 leaving a total of 1630. many days i consume less than 1880 and burn lots more than 250. is this bad for me as my body isn't getting the difference of 1630 calories at the end of each day? . for example today i consumed only 1190 and burnt 608 leaving my body short of 1048 based on the chart.

so if you are not having problems sleeping on your back. it is fine and does not put any risk to the fetus. . your body will tell you when you cannot be on your back anymore. the reason many physicians tell you not to sleep on your back is due to the uterus' pressure on the inferior vena cava (a large blood vessel that takes blood back to the heart from the lower body). this decreases the blood flow back to the heart which causes all of the changes for patients. it causes a decrease in the blood flow to the heart and causes the mother to sweat increase in heart rate and nervous. the mother will need to get off of [her] back to feel better.	is it dangerous to sleep on your back when you are pregnant?

as much as i would like to help you no one can be blindly examined and diagnosed over the internet. you have had this problem for 6 months. at what point to you think it would be a good idea to seek proper medical care? there can be hundreds of reasons to account for your symptoms and it is your responsibility -- as trustee of your body -- to take care of it. the only way that you can get to the bottom of these symptoms is to see a good medical provider -- one who can take a thorough medical history perhaps run a few diagnostic tests.	i have had discomfort in my throat for 4-6 months. . the pain comes and goes and i feel a tightness in my throat. my platelet counts are low. my throat feels tight. what is this?

to diagnose a woman's sexual problem the doctor likely will begin with a thorough evaluation of symptoms and a physical exam. the doctor may perform a pelvic exam to evaluate the health of the reproductive organs and a pap smear to detect changes in the cells of the cervix (to check for cancer or a pre-cancerous condition). he or she may order other tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the problem. an evaluation of your attitude regarding sex as well as other possible contributing factors (fear anxiety past sexual trauma/abuse relationship problems alcohol or drug abuse for example) will help the doctor understand the underlying cause of the problem and make appropriate recommendations for treatment.	how is a female sexual problem diagnosed?

researchers have long known that older people are more likely to get phn (postherpetic neuralgia) the nerve pain after shingles but recent studies have found other factors that increase risks. in one study published in the journal neurology researchers -- including robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y -- looked at data from 965 people with shingles. the researchers identified five risk factors for developing phn in people who had been recently diagnosed with shingles: older female presence of symptoms before the rash appeared like numbness tingling itching or pain severe pain during the illness' initial stages severe rash. importantly the researchers found the more risk factors you have the greater the risk of developing phn. for instance 17% of women with shingles went on to get phn. 26% of people with severe pain did too. but 50% of women who were over 60 and had symptoms before the rash severe rash and acute pain went on to get phn.	what are the risk factors for having nerve pain after shingles?

yes you can but very few people do. mononucleosis is usually caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv). symptoms usually include fever swollen and painful tonsils and enlarged lymph nodes. fatigue and low energy can last for weeks or months. more than 90% of us eventually catch ebv usually during adolescence or early adulthood. in many people the illness is mild and may never be diagnosed as mono. infection by ebv generally results in lifelong immunity—you can only have ebv mono once. there’s also a less common form of mononucleosis caused by infection by cytomegalovirus (cmv). in one study of people with mono about one out of seven had mono caused by cmv; the rest had typical ebv mononucleosis. catching and recovering from ebv mono offers no protection against cmv mono and vice versa. few people get mono from cmv. most people are infected with cmv at some point in life and experience only mild short-lived symptoms. after that they are generally immune to cmv mono or other illnesses caused by cmv. i have had mono three times. all three times were medically confirmed by a doctor upon analysis of a blood test. i was shocked because i was under the impression you could not get it more than once. i told the doctor that i had already had it once so if possibly that's what was showing up in my blood test. she said they test for the active form and i 100% had it. either i am a medical mystery or you can definitely get mono more than once even more than twice! my daughter is 31 yrs old and has had mono confirmed 4 times. the first time she was 15 and was just confirmed today for the 4th time. we were told that it stays in your system forever and when you get stressed don't get enough sleep or if her immune system is low it will come back. it is hard to get some people to understand that she can't run all the time like most 31 yr olds. the doctor told her she is to just to go to work and rest as much as possible. i tested positive for mono 8 or 9 years ago. i am 49 years old and my blood test just came back. the dr. told me that i tested extremely positive for mono. both times my only symptom has been extreme fatigue. thought this stuff was for the youngsters! i have had mono twice i am 18 and i am now just getting over the second time. the first time i got mono i had chicken pox and mono and the second time i had mono strep and a absence in my right tonsil which makes your tonsil full of puss and blood and it constantly has to be drained. both times i was in the hospital for up to five days. so i am living proof that you can get mono and other infections at the same time.	can you get mono twice?
it doesn't sound like an allergic reaction but maybe a side effect of the local anesthetic that may have contained epinephrine. this is used to control bleeding and improve the anesthesia effect. epinephrine is also called adrenalin. call your dentist and inquire.	i got injected anesthetic for a dental filling. i was shaking and my heartrate increased. is that an allergic reaction?
yes its always possible if you had unprotected sex and your late you could be they say its not always a sure thing to take a hpt the first day of your peroid tests like clear blue are normaly on the money cramping can be from the egg attaching itself inside you. i would say try another test in a few days see what that tells you if still a neg. call you gyn and let her know and im sure she can tell you if its something to worry about. also bare in mind that if you did have sex and your having pain in your side you could be having a tube pregnancy which means the egg has attached itself to you tube rather than making its way into where it belongs and that can be a very bad thing so like i siad hold off a few days but if the pain worsens call your doctor asap hope this helps	lower back pain be a sign of pregnancy? my lower right side of my back right above my hip. it is a constant dull pain but with sharp intense bursts periodically. i am a day late on my period right now took a test that showed negative. could i still be pregnant?
the short answer is: no it's not safe. no one should adjust their doses of prescription drugs without consulting a doctor. in your case you're taking one anti-anxiety medication and one antidepressant. you should not adjust the dosage of either of these medications without checking with your doctor first. if you feel the prozac (fluoxetine) is not helping your depression i'd suggest you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. he or she may want to change your antidepressant medication to something else. there are plenty of antidepressants to choose from. i wish you all the best!	i am currently taking 1mg of klonopin twice a day & i would like to increase my 20mg prozac to twice a day. is this safe

doctors do not know why certain hair follicles are programmed to have a shorter growth period than others. although a person's level of androgens -- male hormones normally produced by both men and women -- is believed to be a factor hair loss has nothing to do with virility. an individual's genes however -- from both male and female parents -- unquestionably influence that person's predisposition to male or female pattern baldness. telogen effluvium is temporary hair loss that can occur within a few months after a high fever a severe illness or extreme stress and in women following childbirth. drugs that can cause temporary hair loss include chemotherapy drugs used in cancer treatment blood thinners retinoids used to treat acne and other skin problems beta-adrenergic blockers used to control blood pressure and birth control pills. hair loss can also be caused by burns x-rays and scalp injuries. in such cases normal hair growth usually returns once the cause is eliminated. ringworm caused by a fungal infection can also cause hair loss. the causes of alopecia areata a disease that often strikes children or teenagers remain unexplained. it is thought to be an autoimmune disease meaning that the immune system revs up for unknown reasons and affects the hair follicles. in most cases the hair grows back although it may be very fine and possibly a different color before normal coloration and thickness return. although shampooing too often perms bleaching and dyeing hair do not cause baldness they can contribute to overall thinning by making hair weak and brittle. tight braiding and using rollers or hot curlers can damage and break hair and running hair picks through tight curls can scar hair follicles. in most instances hair grows back normally if the source of the problem is removed but severe damage to the hair or scalp sometimes causes permanent bald patches.	what causes hair loss?
"honestly the only way to diagnose strep is through a lab test. even if all the signs (like throat redness) and symptoms (like soreness) are there it still may not be strep. even ""white spots"" in the back of the mouth are no guarantee it's a case of strep. strep throat is almost always accompanied by fever. are you using a thermometer to measure your son's temperature or are you relying on the old hand-to-the-forehead method? it's very important to use a thermometer when assessing fever. i mention this because it never ceases to amaze me how many people do not have this basic tool in their medicine cabinets. keep in mind also if you're giving your son acetaminophen (tylenol) to ease the pain of the sore throat this could cause him to register a ""normal"" temperature on the thermometer (because acetaminophen is a fever-reducer). instead of speculating about what might be going on with your son i suggest you take him to his pediatrician. since the problem has been going on for nearly a week it's not a bad idea to get medical attention. i hope your little boy feels better soon! wishing you well!"	my 7 yr old son has a sore throat. red in the back and he screams when i touch side of neck. strep? . i cant see the hanging ball well to see if there is white spots. this sore throat has been going on for 4-5 days now. he has no fever complains of stomach aches feels like vomiting and vomited once in these days.

a fracture of the spine whether from osteoporosis trauma or cancer is basically a broken bone. the usual treatment for a broken bone is to stabilize it. a broken vertebral body can be stabilized either by a percutaneous (through the skin) procedure such as a vertebroplasty kyphoplasty or by open surgical procedures. an older technique now rarely used is to remove or sever the nerves supplying the bone; these nerves are called the gray rami communicans. finally various medications for pain can be used. these would include the full range of pain medications including over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen aspirin and the various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and various prescription medications including hydrocodone morphine preparations and the fentanyl patch.	what treatment options are there for fracture of the spine due to osteoporosis besides morphine patches?

most helpful answer this is a question only your doctor can answer. sometimes doctors keep their cardiac stent patients on blood thinners like clopidogrel (plavix) for at least one year after surgery. that's because platelets can stick to the stents and cause a blood clot. you should not discontinue the plavix unless your doctor specifically tells you it's ok. so. take a trip to the cardiologist and ask him or her when you can stop taking the clopidogrel. and good luck with the kidney transplant!	2 med stents december 2011. i am currently taking a daily plavix and 81mg aspirin. when can i stop the plavix? . when i get off the plavix i can get on the active kidney transplant list!
one of the hardest parts about controlling anxiety is that severe anxiety can actually cause physical symptoms that lead to more anxiety. many of those with anxiety start to worry about their health because the symptoms can be so disabling that it's hard to convince your mind that anxiety could be causing them. this is often the case with vertigo. vertigo itself is not technically an anxiety symptom but dizziness – which is often confused with the idea of vertigo – very much is and it's actually a surprisingly common one. since vertigo is almost exclusively caused by hyperventilation the best way to stop the feeling of having vertigo is to make sure that you're not hyperventilating anymore. often this is easier said than done. in the middle of an anxiety attack it's very hard to re-gain control of your breathing. but there are tricks that make the process easier now the trick here is a nice brown paper bag this you put over you head and re-breath your output works all the time. do hope this helps you. good luck ps try getting your life together that would help cut down your problems.	can stress and anxiety cause vertigo. i took a test and my stress level was diagnosed as 74 percent when i get stressed or anxious i tent to dig in my ears i have been diagnosed with anxiety severe panic disorder and agoraphobia of which i am alone 10 to 12 hours a day 4 to 5 days a week. and lately i have been under an enormous amount of stress the last 3 to 4 weeks financial worries having enough food the anniversary of my moms death and last night i was forced to drive last night can all this cause vertigo?

there are two types of sinusitis : acute (sudden onset) and chronic (long-term). sinusitis often develops after a cold or viral infection. most sinus infections improve on their own but sometimes they develop into a bacterial infection -swelling inflammation and mucus production caused by the cold can lead to blockage in the nasal passages which may encourage the growth of bacteria. acute sinusitis whether viral or bacterial may develop into chronic inflammation or infections that may last 8 weeks or longer. chronic sinusitis can lead to permanent changes in the mucous membranes that line the sinuses. as a result of these changes you may become prone to having more sinus infections that may become more difficult to treat. complications of sinusitis (such as an infection of the facial bones called osteomyelitis ) are relatively rare. but when complications occur they may be life-threatening and often require extensive medical or surgical treatment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get sinusitis?

"psychotic disorders contain similar traits. they usually contain hallucinations and/or delusional beliefs. delusions are kind of like irrational thoughts such as ""i'm being followed by the fbi. "" they also contain disorganized thinking. people with psychotic disorders usually have trouble having conversations with people because they cannot stay on track and keep their thoughts organized. they usually go off on tangents or talk about their delusions. they may give unrelated answers to questions kind of like they didn't even hear what you asked. they also contain odd behaviors; behaviors that are out of the social norm. these can be any number of odd behaviors. psychotic disorders are extremely complicated and are often considered to be on a spectrum or a continuum. people fit along a line instead of a specific group."	how does one identify someone with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

as a breast cancer survivor i can share what i've learned from my experiences. i am not a medical professional i can only give my opinions. mammograms do not always detect everything but they have a very important role to play in diagnostics. dense breast tissue most often will obscure many things during mammography therefore many doctors will order an ultrasound or mri. each of these diagnostic tools have unique strengths that play vital roles in proper diagnoses. it seems you are in great hands and that your doctor is doing everything possible to rule everything out without causing delay which would only increase your anxiety. i believe in prevention in all things. i believe in early detection saves lives. most lesions turn out to be cysts. however should a different type of lesion be found the sooner the better. if it should turn out to be cancerous the earlier it is found diagnosed and treated then better the outcome. also the earlier a tumor is diagnosed the easier the treatment. mammograms do save lives! i found my tumor myself through self-exam. i have a very aggressive form of breast cancer which grows very quickly so the lump formed and grew large quickly between my annual mammograms. my diagnosis triggered my sister getting her first mammogram through which two tumors were found. mammography saved her life! mammography also brings relief and joy! two days ago i underwent my latest mammogram and two years post diagnosis i am cancer free!	i am 34 years old my doctor has confirmed breast nodules. should i worry that my dr. ordered both a mamm and ultrasound? . i have been told the ultrasound is usually ordered based on the mammogram results. i wondered if it was cause for concern that he was shotgunning them both at once same day one after the other.

i do not know your age or medical history but the urge to urinate followed by a scanty amount of urine could indicate an issue with your prostate gland (you actually sit on this gland). since you sit all day long playing video games this could be one possibility. people with prostatic hypertrophy (large prostates) can definitely exhibit symptoms of this nature. you need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined so get out that chair. you can see a urologist or your primary care provider. since you also mentioned some sort of cyst on your penis i would suggest the urologist.	feels like i have to pee but nothing comes out. tiny amounts then i go back and another tiny amount. worst at night. also have a cyst or something on the underside of penis. i am very weak from inactivity. i have done nothing for the last 4 years. but sit and play videogames. now i can barely sit because it hurts way too much. my bladder holds way more than 2 cups of liquid.
which virus are you speaking of. the hiv virus for example is spread through body fluids. her additional bloody fluids could certainly increase the chances of your infection passing to her. therefore your suggestion is not a good idea.	does having sex during menstrual cycle lessen the chance of spreading the virus to her?
hives are produced when histamine and other compounds are released from cells called mast cells which are normally found in the skin. histamine causes fluid to leak from the local blood vessels leading to swelling in the skin. hives are very common. although they can be annoying they usually resolve on their own over a period of weeks and are rarely medically serious. some hives are caused by allergies to such things as foods medications and insect stings but in the majority of cases no specific cause for them is ever found. although patients may find it frustrating not to know what has caused their hives maneuvers like changing diet soap detergent and makeup are hardly ever helpful in preventing hives and are not necessary for the most part. having hives may cause stress but stress by itself does not cause hives. in rare cases (some hereditary others caused by bee stings or drug allergy) urticaria and angioedema are accompanied by a striking decrease in blood pressure (shock) and difficulty breathing. this is called anaphylaxis. ordinary hives may be widespread and disturbing to look at but the vast majority of cases of hives do not lead to life-threatening complications.	what causes hives?

"aw i'm sorry for your little one. you're certainly describing the classic symptoms of constipation. luckily there are a few things you can do at home to see if you can help your child have a bowel movement. however if your child goes more than a couple of days without a bowel movement you need to call your pediatrician. one thing you can do is give your child some prune juice. unless your child has blood sugar problems (diabetes) he or she should be able to tolerate this treatment just fine. prune juice is a tried and true approach to constipation relief. the best way to ""treat"" constipation is to prevent it. feed your child a healthy diet that includes plenty of fiber from whole grains fruits and vegetables. also make sure your child drinks plenty of water and gets some exercise every day. these three components are crucial in preventing constipation. please do not give your child a laxative without consulting your pediatrician. dosing can be tricky with children and your pediatrician is in the best position to advise you about what laxative to use and what dosage to give. wishing you all the best! you may have the answer. abdominal discomfort and inability to have a bowel movement in a five year old is typically constipation (the pain may be caused by gas) or even stool-holding (a condition where the child does not want to defecate and tries to hold it. ) if the continues to have pain and is not defecating he will need to be properly examined. if constipation has been a long-term issue he will need to see his medical provider anyway or some specific dietary intervention or perhaps the addition of a stool softener in his diet."	my 5 year old has stomach pains and cant poop.

so the best way to find out is to do the following: 1. whenever they did the ultrasound you should subtract 7 weeks and 4 days. this should give you the time when you ovulated. this will give you a very good idea when you conceived. you need to understand that ultrasound at that time is accurate up to one week. so the date you come up will be within one week of the actual date you conceived. .	i recently found out i’m pregnant. they said that i'm 9 weeks and 4 days. how can i find out when i conceived? . the doctors did an ultrasound and from the measurements of the baby. i've never really kept track of my periods because they are so irregular.
prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in american men and the second leading cause of deaths from cancer after lung cancer. the estimated lifetime risk of being diagnosed with the disease is 17. 6% for caucasians and 20. 6% for african americans. the lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer similarly is 2. 8% and 4. 7% respectively. as reflected in these numbers prostate cancer is likely to impact the lives of a significant proportion of men that are alive today. over the years however the death rate from this disease has shown a steady decline and currently more than 2 million men in the u. s. are still alive after being diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lives. although it is subject to some controversy many experts in this field therefore recommend that beginning at age 40 all men should undergo screening for prostate cancer.	why is it important to diagnose prostate cancer early?

i've been dealing with panic disorder; officially since 1976. i'm not sure there is just one singular cause of it period. it could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink. something triggers the flight / fight syndrome when there doesn't seem to be a reason for it. something is activating the adrenal glands. i do think stress; while it's hard to tell if you're under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense. dealing with this issue; when you're new to it can cause much stress. i've been on benzodiazepines on and off since 1976. i’ve been more on meds over the last 25 years than off. your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird; which can kick in an attack. try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps. exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot. the medication; should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose. my panic was so bad; i had to open my own company to stay at home whenever i had to. it usually comes and goes; as they say waxes and wanes. usually it has other phobias which develop as well. you want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks. i don't know that they will ever disappear; however they should diminish in frequency and intensity. best of luck and work on your end helps a lot!	my primary doctor diagnosed me with anxiety disorder and prescribed xanax and zoloft. why do i still have panic attacks?

two forms of high blood pressure have been described: essential (or primary) hypertension and secondary hypertension. essential hypertension is a far more common condition and accounts for 95% of hypertension. the cause of essential hypertension is multifactorial that is there are several factors whose combined effects produce hypertension. in secondary hypertension which accounts for 5% of hypertension the high blood pressure is secondary to (caused by) a specific abnormality in one of the organs or systems of the body. (secondary hypertension is discussed further in a separate section later. ) essential hypertension affects approximately 72 million americans yet its basic causes or underlying defects are not always known. nevertheless certain associations have been recognized in people with essential hypertension. for example essential hypertension develops only in groups or societies that have a fairly high intake of salt exceeding 5. 8 grams daily. salt intake may be a particularly important factor in relation to essential hypertension in several situations and excess salt may be involved in the hypertension that is associated with advancing age african american background obesity hereditary (genetic) susceptibility and kidney failure (renal insufficiency). the institute of medicine of the national academies recommends healthy 19 to 50-year-old adults consume only 3. 8 grams of salt to replace the average amount lost daily through perspiration and to achieve a diet that provides sufficient amounts of other essential nutrients. genetic factors are thought to play a prominent role in the development of essential hypertension. however the genes for hypertension have not yet been identified. (genes are tiny portions of chromosomes that produce the proteins that determine the characteristics of individuals. ) the current research in this area is focused on the genetic factors that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. this system helps to regulate blood pressure by controlling salt balance and the tone (state of elasticity) of the arteries. approximately 30% of cases of essential hypertension are attributable to genetic factors. for example in the united states the incidence of high blood pressure is greater among african americans than among caucasians or asians. also in individuals who have one or two parents with hypertension high blood pressure is twice as common as in the general population. rarely certain unusual genetic disorders affecting the hormones of the adrenal glands may lead to hypertension. (these identified genetic disorders are considered secondary hypertension. ) the vast majority of patients with essential hypertension have in common a particular abnormality of the arteries: an increased resistance (stiffness or lack of elasticity) in the tiny arteries that are most distant from the heart (peripheral arteries or arterioles). the arterioles supply oxygen-containing blood and nutrients to all of the tissues of the body. the arterioles are connected by capillaries in the tissues to the veins (the venous system) which returns the blood to the heart and lungs. just what makes the peripheral arteries become stiff is not known. yet this increased peripheral arteriolar stiffness is present in those individuals whose essential hypertension is associated with genetic factors obesity lack of exercise overuse of salt and aging. inflammation also may play a role in hypertension since a predictor of the development of hypertension is the presence of an elevated c reactive protein level (a blood test marker of inflammation) in some individuals.	what causes high blood pressure?

thanks for your question! what you're describing certainly could be part of the start of menopause. because of your age that would be my first thought especially if you're also experiencing hot flashes (flushes) night sweats or the need to urinate (pee) more often. your best bet would be to make a trip to see your gynecologist. if in fact you are entering menopause your medical provider will be able to tell you what to expect over the next few years and can discuss related issues such as hormone replacement therapy and bone health. so call and make an appointment to get checked out. i wish you all the best! this sounds like me i am 55 yrs old and still am having periods not sure when my periods will stop if this your normal periods are like every month maybe not there is a test the dr can give to determine if you are starting menopause or peri menopause	i am 51 years old. my periods are heavey and bright red is this part of menopause?
your pharmacist can answer questions about medications side effects and drug interactions but can't prescribe new medications for heartburn. see your doctor if you think you should change your medication type dose or brand. never stop taking a medication without first checking with your doctor since suddenly stopping some drugs can cause medical complications. call your doctor if you experience chest pain that isn't caused by heartburn or if you aren't sure. a surprising number of people having mild heart attacks dismissed their chest pain as heartburn.	when should i see my doctor for heartburn?
no i don't think that your pregnant. i say this because of all the negative test feedback. however i do think that you should see a doctor if you are having such heavy discharge. you could have a number of things going on such as a yeast infection ( which you could try over the counter testing for to determ if that's possibly what it is. they also sell treatment for yeast infections as well. ) you could also have some type of std ( i know that's not what you want to hear. ) i know its not a 100% answer but better to be safe than sorry. if you don't have insurance you can try the free clinic most county's have them. depending on your income you only have to pay a minimum fee or in most cases nothing at all.	if you miss your period how long after will it show positive on test if you r pregnant? how long should u wait to take1. i had a 3day period last month plus it was late. this month i haven't had 1 at all! i am supposed to start my period the 2nd week of the month and i took a pregnancy test and it says negative. i just wanted some advice if i am taking the test to early or if it could be something else because i have had this problem once before but never have had a period only last 3days. i am bloated like and have a lot of discharge. i have took over 8 test within the last month. any advice or help please?

"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. sometimes pregnancy can stretch the abdominal muscles out so much that they can't ""snap back. "" they're kind of like elastic that way -- and i'm sure you've seen how floppy an elastic waistband gets after it's been over-stretched. i'd suggest you visit your doctor to find out if he or she thinks this is the problem in your case. if so he or she may be able to tell you whether or not abdominal muscle exercises will help. if all else fails you can have this corrected with a cosmetic surgery procedure called abdominoplasty or "" tummy tuck. "" in this surgery the abdominal muscles are literally sewed back together to give your belly a tight look again. however this surgery is not recommended for any woman who plans to have more children. save it for the time when you're confident your family is complete! probably not the news you wanted to hear but i wanted to be honest with you. wishing you all the best! i had same problem and found out it was my thyroid i gained 56 lbs in 4 weeks have some blood drawn but tell ur doctor to test ur thyroid. there are 75% of americans who have thyroid disease and it goes untested. try that and congrats on the new baby. god bless and hope this help u out to ease ur mind some. \ i learned this trick from a woman i used to work with who at the time just had her 5th child. she said the secret is wearing a girdle for at least 6-8 weeks. your muscles - and everything else that had to get pushed out smashed and repositioned to make room for your little blessing -have all essentially been displaced stretched beyond their limit. you have to ""retrain"" your stomach muscles to hold everything in place - back to their original position and not bulging out making you appear pregnant. i know this works because my sister and her own daughter did not use this trick - both still look pregnant to this day. it worked for me for both of my pregnancies i was back to my original weight and shape. i hope it works for you as well. hi there belly fat is the most difficult one to lose than any other. likely that is why you are having problems with losing it. i would have suggested you to go for a abdominoplasty or ”tummy tuck” which is a surgical procedure done by cosmetic surgery specialists where excess fat from deposits located between the skin and muscle is removed. since you are pregnant it is not a wise idea to go for it now. but you can always have it as a backup whenever you think you are ready go for it. i personally suggest you dr. ronald levine of toronto. he helped my twin with a “tummy tuck”. before going for any doctors please do a brief research. regards amy"	"i iook like i'm 8 months pregnant. when i'm not. i am 5'-7"" and weigh 165 lbs but all my life was never over 115 lbs until 6 months into my pregnancy where i gained 86 lbs. i look ""normal"" in the sense that i do not look fat and have no cellulite or hanging skin but if i don't suck in when i'm standing i look like i'm 8 months pregnant i have actually had people tell me i look good for being so far along. i have tried exercising and dieting and had success and lost weight but with no change to my stomach. help"
hi i found this piece of info if this is you? during a tia one of the small blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. atherosclerosis is a common cause of narrowed arteries. it occurs when fatty deposits known as plaques develop on the inner lining of your blood vessels. this can cause your blood vessels to become thickened hard and less elastic making it more difficult for blood to flow through them. ok if this is you then simple cayenne pepper may help clear this plaque away for you there are many ways to take cayenne you can try capsules the ok but when the capsule opens inside you it can give you the cramps or like me you can mix cayenne with tomato paste and thin with olive oil to start with to a heat that suits you next time you mix you can add a bit more and so on take 3 small spoonful's each morning wash each down with water now if you want because it very good for your blood do a jar of very fine chopped garlic and keep this in olive oil just add a spoonful on top of the cayenne before you take it. all very good for you and give it a couple of weeks to start working at full strength. good luck	"should i be worried if i have symptoms of a tia occuring 5-10 times a month? . i have lupus. for the last 2 years i have been experiencing numbness and tingling on 1/2 of my face 5-10 times per month. i literally can feel a perfect line of numb vs. normal down my nose and lips on the left side. they have done mri's that have come out normal. now i am occasionally feeling numbness/tingling down my arm and leg also on the left side. i don't know if is should be worried or just chalk it up as ""yet another lupus symptom""."

i assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. i have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. the probable causes:the scrotal issues are due to the dryness of the skin and skin hair follicle infection. there is hyperkeratosis on the scrotal skin. all of these issues develop due to unhygienic urogenital habit and unhygienic skin condition of the areas of the external genitalia. no need to worry as i am suggesting very effective remedies for you to get better in a short period. the mouth sores are due to throat infection and it looks like a mixture of bacterial and viral infection. so you need to start the treatment immediately. treatment plan:for genital skin issues:- 1. the most important medical remedy for you is to shave the area completely including scrotum pubic area and the groins with a blade. make it a habit to do undershave (armpits and the genital area) before the hair grow very tiny. 2. keep the area clean and dry and apply hydrozole (combination of hydrocortisone and clotrimazole) cream on the whole of the genital area including scrotum. 3. you should take a prescription for amoxicillin. keep taking paracetamol every 8 hourly until you no more have fever. 4. apply some gel like orajel (benzocaine) on the mouth ulcers and stay for 5 minutes. then rinse with tap water. 5. do gargles with scope mouthwash. take plenty of water and proper rest. regarding follow up:for further information consult an internal medicine physician online. ---> <link>	Hi doctor,I am having 101 degree fever daily for past four nights.

the poison ivy rash usually starts one or two days after exposure though the delay between contact and its onset can be longer up to several days. this may lead to confusion over where the exposure took place. the first signs of the rash are curved lines of red itchy bumps or blisters. these continue to appear for many days depending on how much resin touched the skin at a given point. this makes it seem as though the rash is spreading although the fluid in blisters is just part of the allergic reaction and contains no chemicals or bacteria. it also makes it appear that there may still be poison ivy in clothes and/or on pets. although this is theoretically possible repeated washing of these often produces no improvement. poison ivy is not contagious neither from one person to someone else nor from one part of the body to another. many references emphasize that animals can carry the poison ivy resin. there's no doubt this is true but its practical significance may be limited. the first sign of poison ivy after all is usually a curved line of rash on the skin. unless your dog is shaped like a curved line your poison ivy is more likely to have come from a stem or leaf which dragged against the skin not from your pet.	what are the signs and symptoms of the poison ivy rash?
yes. you can switch plans during medicare's annual enrollment period which runs from october 15th through december 7th each year. pre-existing medical conditions do not factor into your eligibility. the only exception to that is if you have original medicare and a medigap plan to help pick up costs medicare alone does not cover. after an initial enrollment period if you apply for a new medigap plan insurers can take the state of your health into consideration when deciding whether to sell you a plan and how much to charge. but if you have medicare advantage or want to switch your prescription drug plan (medicare part d) you can do that with no concern about pre-existing conditions as long as you do so during the open enrollment period.	can a person change medicare plans having preexisting conditions?

"most commonly ringworm appears as one or more round or oval patches of baldness or scaly skin on the scalp or beard. typically the circular patches spread along their outer borders while clearing at the center which gives them a ringed appearance and the name "" ringworm. "" but you don't always see this pattern. other patterns include: patchy dandruff. scalp hair that breaks off at the surface resulting in a ""black dot"" appearance with mild to moderate dandruff. inflamed reddened crusty tender and swollen areas with small bumps that look like blisters. sometimes swollen lymph nodes and fever occur with ringworm infections. when fungal infections occur other areas of skin may develop a delayed allergic reaction in the form of a rash that looks like blisters known as an ""id"" reaction. id reactions from ringworm of the scalp usually appear on the face. early diagnosis and treatment of ringworm of the scalp or beard may stop the infection from becoming uncomfortable and prevent scarring and permanent hair loss. ringworm can be confused with other conditions with similar symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."	what are the symptoms of ringworm of the scalp or beard?

the side effects of surgery are significant. you’re investing a lot up front with the highest risks up front for the potential long-term benefit 10 15 20 years down the road. the nerves that cause erections travel right alongside the prostate there’s the potential that those nerves could be injured. if that happens you could see problems with erections as far as quality or no erections at all. the great news is that with new techniques we can actually now preserve those nerves so that men have a much higher likelihood of having normal erections and with the medications that are now available the combination of the group surgery techniques and medications sexual dysfunction really should not be a major concern for prostate patients.	what are the side effects of prostate surgery?

"tubal ligation is a sterilization procedure that renders you unable to get pregnant. in tubal ligation the fallopian tubes are cut or blocked which makes it impossible for a sperm to reach an egg or for an egg to reach the uterus. since you had a tubal ligation procedure it's not likely you're pregnant. that said you should call your health care provider's office before the novasure procedure to let them know your period is late. they will be able to advise you regarding what steps to take (such as whether or not they want you to take a pregnancy test). on a broader note i wanted to say i hope you did not discontinue your medications without the supervision of a health care provider. conditions like high blood pressure often don't clear up on their own. if you still have blood pressure or depression issues you would be well-advised to obtain medical treatment to ensure your health and well-being. best of luck to you! i had my tubal ligation almost 16 years ago. i am currently 25 weeks pregnant. believe me i was stunned! but the doctors said that it can happen and i am evidence of that. our daughter destiny grace will be joining us around august 27th and although there are some health concerns considering that i'm a 3 time cancer survivor and about to turn 40 we are expecting a healthy baby girl. it was not an tubal pregnancy she made it directly into the womb and has been there from the start! i have a friend and she had her tube tied for 17yrs. she got pregnant and couldn't belive it. neither could i her tube came untied. so yes you could be pregnant. you could be going through mood swing and hot flases and still be pregnant. no one do not know your body who are they to judge only god and mother nature know best. good luck! it is possible to get pregnant after a tubal ligation. especially if you had the tl during a c-section. the fail rate for a tubal ligation is around 1 percent but goes up after ten years or if you had the tl during a c-section. sometimes the tubes reattach themselves or a fistula forms. although tubal pregnancy rates are higher if you had a tl than if you didn't have the ligation it is not ""more likely"" that you will have a tubal pregnancy than a successful one. if you are pregnant it would not ""most likely be ectopic. "" it's simply more likely than if you had not had a tubal ligation but the odds are still in your favor. i believe the chances of a woman without a tubal ligation has a 1 in 400 chance of an ectopic pregnancy but now you might have a 1 in 100 chance. so the odds are still quite in your favor but technically you're ""4 times more likely than you were before"" the tubal ligation. make sense? if you had clips put on your fallopian tubes they can fall off. and ties can break. but it's rare. my guess is you are either entering menopause which is not a linear process for most of us. we stop our periods they come again and get off and on until finally they don't return. or your body is reacting to the medication changes. our bodies are more sensitive than we realize. when we moved and i was about 40 my body stopped having periods for nearly 7 months. then they suddenly resumed and never missed one since. now i'm 52 and i'm still having my periods regularly. if i were you i'd let myself wonder about pregnancy. but i'd think it's probably the third most likely possibility. (and an ectopic pregnancy will be looked at quickly. ) still missing that many months of your period if you are not having mood swings or hot flashes would get me to call my doctor just to check things out. good luck!"	i am 45 had tubal ligation 15 years ago and am 2 months late could i be pregnant? . my mother did not go in to menopause until her 60s. i have been under a lot of stress for the past two years. stopped taking all medication about 6 months ago (hbp antidepressant antipsychotic and one for headaches). my periods are irregular only in that they are heavy and painful and a few days off.

some people call a transient ischemic attack (tia) a mini- stroke because the symptoms are like those of a stroke but do not last long. a tia happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or reduced often by a blood clot. after a short time blood flows again and the symptoms go away. with a stroke the blood flow stays blocked and the brain has permanent damage. a tia is a warning: it means you are likely to have a stroke in the future. if you think you are having a tia call. early treatment can help prevent a stroke. if you think you have had a tia but your symptoms have gone away you still need to call your doctor right away. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what is a transient ischemic attack (tia)?

diarrhea is a condition that once again as a pharmacist i can tell you all the time i ask a lot of questions especially around the fact of are you running a fever? how long have you had the diarrhea for? is the diarrhea -- do you have dark though diarrhea? because that could be a sign of internal bleeding. so you want to be very careful about the suggestions that we make. in the case of diarrhea too medications sometimes aren't always the best choice. you want to change your diet? you want to make sure that you are hydrated. a lot of people forget that when you have diarrhea you lose a lot of fluids. so you want to do re-hydration first. things like pedialyte increasing your water intake and then introducing all foods in general. typically in the past there was something called the brat diet which was bran rice applesauce and toast to help with diarrhea. that actually is not the recommendation anymore they actually want people to start eating pretty normally to get their body back in balance as well as increasing their fluids. only then if there are some problems where they say you know i've been increasing my diet i still have a little bit of diarrhea imodium or something like that be appropriate. but we do need to ask a few questions to find out what is really going on?	what's the best over-the- counter treatment for diarrhea?
believe it or not when you walk into a room what your eye sees can actually determine whether or not you’re going to have an easy time falling asleep or a bad time. so the first thing i tell people to do is clean up your bedroom. get the clutter out. because it’s pretty hard to fall asleep with a stack of laundry over here and a big pile of books over there and a very sort of jumbled night table okay. and so i talk to them about cleaning up the clutter getting that stuff out of the way so that when you walk in you’re more peaceful more serene surrounding. that may also have to do with color. so there are studies that look at what is the color of your bedroom and how can that affect your ability to fall asleep. it turned out that the color itself is not important but the hue of the color is. so the brightness of that color turns out to be a big factor. so when you’re painting your bedroom you don’t want a high gloss finish you want more of a matted finish. now granted a very bright yellow is probably not a great place to fall asleep but a more muted yellow probably is. so again it may not matter the color so much as the brightness of that color.	how does a messy bedroom affect my sleep?
it sounds like you are losing weight and your body is changing. here are some tips that might help: consider working with a certified personal trainer to help you incorporate strength training exercises to help build muscle while monitoring your body fat. try yoga as another way to build muscle mass. eat some protein with small amounts of carbohydrate after working out to help stimulate muscle growth (e. g. protein bar peanut butter on whole wheat toast greek yogurt with almonds). see this article for more on what to eat before and after workouts eat balanced meals which includes all the food groups -- fruit vegetables healthy fats whole grains low fat dairy and lean protein. a registered dietitian can help you develop an eating plan that helps you lose weight in a healthy way. to find one go to eatright. org even though it's hard try to be patient. it takes time to find a healthy lifestyle that works for you. get the support you need!	despite regular cardio exercise and eating healthy i can't seem to lose weight? . okay maybe i can't lose weight is misleading but i am losing muscle and gaining fat. my exercise includes running for an hour at least four times a week for over a month and eating includes eating salads eggs fruits and white meats like chicken (and none of the junk i won't even allow myself cheat days). in spite of the fact that i have lost 20lbs i don't look any thinner. in fact i've gained fat and it's becoming increasingly harder to continue keep the same running time and pace.
the only sure-fire way to avoid getting genital herpes is to abstain from sex or have sex only with someone who is also herpes-free. short of that a latex condom offers some protection if it covers the infected area. remember you can get genital herpes by receiving oral sex (fellatio cunnilingus analingus) from someone with a cold sore on the mouth. likewise you can get oral herpes from someone's genitals by way of oral sex. keep in mind that your partner can be contagious even without visible sores. if you know that a sex partner has genital herpes you can reduce your risk by having sex (vaginal anal or oral intercourse) only when he or she has no symptoms. nevertheless genital herpes can be contagious even when there are no visible symptoms so you should always use a latex barrier such as a condom or a dental dam.	if i don't have genital herpes now how can i avoid it in the future?

most helpful answer that's an excellent question and i'm glad you asked. first of all it's important to realize experiencing a severe headache while taking a blood thinner can be a sign of a medical emergency especially if it's accompanied by sudden weakness dizziness confusion or the inability to speak clearly. in that case you should call 911. as you probably know all the over-the-counter headache remedies called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) have blood-thinning properties. therefore it may not be a good idea to combine them with a prescription anticoagulant (blood thinner). nsaids include aspirin ibuprofen and naproxyn. read the label of any brand name medication to see if it contains any of these. so what does that leave you with? acetaminophen (tylenol) is the primary over-the-counter pain reliever that does not contain an nsaid. assuming you're not allergic to it you can try taking plain acetaminophen to see if that helps your headache. your best bet is to call your medical provider to find out what he or she recommends for a simple headache when you're taking a blood thinner. wishing you all the best!	im on blood thinner what can i take for a headache

most helpful answer there may be hundreds of possible (allergic causes). it would be impossible to determine which one or more allergens without an extensive medical history and perhaps some allergy testing. in the meantime consider taking a long-acting antihistamine (claritin zyrtec allegra) since whatever is causing this reaction is still in your midst.	itching in hands feet & lower legs. it feels like skin & interior. antihis controls it a few hours. cause? what do i do? . i've had this severe itching for 3 days.

i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group 60-100 (just celebrated a 101sst birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease.	is it normal for a patient to have anxiety when having an uncurable severe illness?
arthritis of the knee is an inflammatory disorder of the knee joint that is often painful. arthritis has many causes. osteoarthritis (oa) is caused by degeneration of cartilage in the knee. in its extreme form the menisci (cartilage) will be completely eroded and the femur will rub on the tibia bone on bone. osteoarthritis causes a chronically painful knee that is often more painful with activity. treatment is aimed at pain control with over-the-counter pain relievers. anti-inflammatory medications either over-the-counter or by your doctor's prescription are also quite helpful. more severe oa can be treated with narcotic pain medicines or a knee joint replacement in which a synthetic joint replaces your knee joint.	what is osteoarthritis of the knee and how is it treated?

the primary benefit for reduced pap smear screening would be less over treatment -- especially in younger patients. in the 1980s i can remember young women being sent for laser destruction of cervical tissue for what we now consider to be mild dysplasia or cin 1. some of the more aggressive treatments can remove a significant amount of cervical tissue. if the removal of cervical tissue is extensive (removal of tissue can range from a few millimeters to slightly less than an inch) it can undermine the ability of the cervix to remain closed until full-term delivery. fortunately studies were done that demonstrated young women with a healthy immune system were able to clear many mild cervical cell changes on their own. this was true in about 60% of mild cases. more frequent pap smears in this group for one to two years after diagnosis would identify the small group that did not spontaneously clear.	how do the new recommendations for pap smears benefit patients?

all women see a decline in their fertility beginning around age 35 making it far more difficult -- but not impossible -- to conceive naturally. the risk of birth defects including down syndrome increases as a woman ages as does the risk of an ectopic pregnancy which can be life-threatening. treatments such as in vitro fertilization have made it possible to conceive well into the mid-40s. for many doctors however the cutoff point is around age 45 a time when many believe a woman’s eggs are no longer healthy enough for a normal conception -- although normal pregnancies can and do occur at this age. with the inception of donor eggs a woman could actually carry a child and give birth well into her 60s and beyond depending on her individual health status. although this is possible it is not necessarily a recommended or accepted practice.	with all the advances in fertility treatments how old is too old for a woman to try to get pregnant?
a new study has found a direct link between sleep and the creation of long-term memories. scientists at washington university school of medicine have discovered a cluster of cells in the fruit-fly brain that controls sleep. by manipulating those cells scientists were able to establish long-term memories in fruit flies by controlling their sleep habits. using their ability to control the fruit flies’ sleep the scientists tested the insects’ ability to learn — and retain — information. here’s how they did it and what they found: as a test of learning researchers exposed male fruit flies to other male flies that had been engineered to smell like female fruit flies. after a few unsuccessful mating attempts the flies learned not to court these female-in-disguise flies. without sleep the fruit flies retained this knowledge of the pretend-female flies for a short period of time amounting to a few hours. scientists put their fruit-fly subjects to sleep after the courtship training. with sleep the fruit flies were able to retain the same information for several days. sleep enabled the fruit flies to convert short-term knowledge into long-term memory. we’ve long known that there was a relationship between sleep memory and learning. you don’t have to be a scientist to have a sense of this. think about your typical state of mind — and your inclination to retain new information — at the end of a long busy day. our brains use sleep as the time to determine what information can be discarded and what is useful enough that it should be stored as longer-term memories.	is there a link between sleep and long-term memory?

yes actually that is completely normal for ibs. irritable bowel syndrome (also sometimes called irritable bowel disease) includes an array of different types of bowel problems. in general ibs refers to a condition in which the large intestine (bowel) becomes inflamed and irritated. this can produce symptoms of pain indigestion and changes in stool. the pattern of symptoms for each person with ibs is different. some people tend to experience more constipation with ibs while others experience more diarrhea. but often a person with ibs struggles to cope with a blend of these two extremes. it's not uncommon for ibs to cause constipation one week and diarrhea the next. your husband may find he needs to make dietary changes to help manage his ibs. he may need to find the right amount of fiber that helps soften his stool enough to avoid constipation but not so much it makes the diarrhea worse. ibs is an unpleasant condition and your husband undoubtedly can use all the support you can offer. wishing you well!	husband has been diagnosed w/ibs. it involves diarrhea & sometimes it involves constipation. is this normal?

you are abusing drugs and if you are caught with one of the ever-increasing sensitive tests available you will need to pay the price. beating a drug test is not the real underlying issue here my friend. the real issue is that you are abusing strong drugs (and alcohol) and will likely suffer some severe medical consequences for those decisions. is it really worth it? i can't (and won't) tell you how to circumvent a drug detection test since i don't know what kind or sensitivity of test the course is doing or how much of those substances you have locked in your cells ready to reveal your secret. i suspect you will be found out. if not now eventually. you have not changed your drug behavior and need help with your substance abuse. don't wait until it is too late mike.	someone drinks alot for 3 nights and takes 4 15mg oxycodones how long will it take to have a clean urine & etg test? . if somebody drinks heavily for 3 nights and takes four 15 milligram oxycodone how long will it take to have a clean urine sample with an etg test and a very sophisticated court drug test?

certain classes of antibiotics are safe. and when you go visit your doctor they are fully aware of what classes you can be on. if you have any questions though when you come and drop off your prescription make sure you talk to the pharmacist. will be able to double check that information for you if the doctor may have prescribed an antibiotic that maybe you are allergic to when he didn't realize that either. let us know because we'll be more than happy to call them inform them and possibly get the prescription changed to something else.	are antibiotics safe during pregnancy?
hpv infection is caused by a virus. more than 100 types of hpv have been found. some types cause genital warts and some can lead to cervical cancer. types 6 and 11 cause most genital warts. other types such as 16 and 18 are high-risk and can cause abnormal cell changes on the cervix. how the disease is spread (transmission) hpv is spread by direct contact. the virus can be spread to or from the genitals anus mouth or throat during sexual activities. but warts in the mouth or throat are extremely rare. condoms can lower your risk of getting genital warts. you can prevent infection when you use them every time you have sex. after the infection occurs it may spread to other areas of the genitals or to the anal area. you can spread the virus even if you do not have any symptoms of infection or any visible warts. there is a small chance that a pregnant woman can pass the virus to her baby. it is unknown if it is spread during vaginal delivery or if it is spread during the pregnancy. most women with genital warts do not need to have a cesarean delivery. but your doctor might recommend a cesarean delivery if the genital warts would be in the way or bleed a lot during vaginal delivery. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what causes genital warts human papillomavirus?

"have your husband pin down where the joint pain is. if it's in the hip there is a condition called avascular necrosis that can happen where the blood flow to the hip bone decreased due to hiv and/or the medications and the hip bone dies in the areas that aren't getting enough blood and oxygen. there is also something happening with people who have been living with hiv and on meds for many years called ""fragility syndrome"". the condition is poorly understood and we don't always know whether its a side effect of medications or the byproduct of long term inflammation from your body fighting the virus (yes even when on meds and undetectable) that causes accelerated arthritis heart disease and other conditions related to inflammation. have your husband go to his doctor and ask for either an x-ray of the area that is bothering him or what's called a dexa scan which will tell him and his doctor if he is experiencing some bone ""thinning"" (similar to osteoporosis that women have after menopause) as a result of hiv or the meds. if it is or even if it isn't it may be a good idea for him to be on calcium and vitamin d daily to help keep the calcium in his bones which will keep them strong!"	could hiv have something to do with my husband's severe joint pain or should we seek an ra specialist?
most helpful answer you may have a few days of mouth discomfort but your dentist will provide you with some pain medication. you may need to alter your diet a bit (assuming you are hungry) but as far as complications are concerned this would be unlikely. assuming you are healthy. one thing of concern especially the lower extraction sites would be acquiring a dry socket. this is when the blood clot (part of the healing process) can become dislodged. can be caused by sucking liquids through a straw smoking. can be very painful but can be remedied by going back to dentist or oral surgeon and having what is called gel-foam usually coated with a substance called eugenol placed in socket. this usually takes care of pain and promotes healing.	getting all four wisdom teeth removed all at once over spring break. should i be worried of complications?

rest relaxation and regularly scheduled pain medicine are the best treatments for most broken ribs. rib fractures usually result from a blow to the chest or back (as in a car accident or a fall). a broken rib can even come from vigorously swinging a golf club or strenuous coughing. broken ribs can be extremely painful. often the pain from a rib fracture is worse when taking a deep breath. severe broken ribs require evaluation and treatment at a hospital; usually these cause so much pain that a person naturally seeks medical attention. the key to recovery from broken ribs is pain control. the pain from a rib fracture results in “respiratory splinting ” or voluntarily reducing the depth of breathing. some experts believe this increases the risk for pneumonia or other lung problems. pain medicines may allow deeper breathing and help someone with a rib fracture get back to normal activities more quickly. pain medicines can include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) like ibuprofen or naproxen but controlling the pain of broken ribs may require stronger opiate pain medicines like hydrocodone or oxycodone. most rib fractures heal completely within six weeks but many patients can return to normal work and leisure activities much sooner than that.	how do i recover from broken ribs? . rest relaxation and regularly scheduled pain medicine are the best treatments for most broken ribs.

it's always worrisome when a loved one is experiencing painful scary symptoms like your husband's. in fact i always think it's harder to cope with these things when it's happening to my husband instead of me don't you? so many conditions could cause the symptoms you're describing. that's why your husband's physician is having him undergo an endoscopy. this test will help figure out what's going on so that you your husband and your physician can work together to put together a treatment plan. it's also possible the endoscopy is just one of several tests your husband's health care provider will run before making a diagnosis. it can be very hard to wait through all of this testing but hang in there. meanwhile remember to take care of your own health needs too. as the caregiver you're under a tremendous amount of stress and you don't want to get sick. be sure to eat right drink plenty of fluids and maybe go for a walk when you can. try to get plenty of sleep. you'll feel better and you'll be in a strong position to see your husband through this health crisis. best wishes to you!	something to worry about? colon cancer? . my husband is having an endoscope next week. he has has severe bloody diareha for years and he has massive swelling on upper left abdomen which started a few months ago. the pain is severe to the point where he feels as though he is splitting. in one month he has gained 30 pounds due to this mass on his side. he is 34 years old i am very concerned about the symptoms. i know we will find out soon but i'd like to know how to proceed after the endo and do his symptoms sound indicitive of cancer?
when it comes to pregnancy pounds timing matters. chances are weight gain during the first three months will be minimal -- and should be according to the iom (institute of medicine) guidelines. you don't need any extra calories during the first trimester; although the baby's growth is rapid he is so small that his development doesn't warrant additional energy. however you may add some pounds to your frame during the first three months because you're hungrier or because of fluid retention. some women even lose weight because they don't feel well enough to eat their usual diet. once the second trimester starts and the baby's growth begins in earnest gaining weight on a steady basis is a must. plan on putting on about a pound each week with a prepregnancy bmi of 24. 9 and below and about a half pound a week if you had a prepregnancy bmi of 24. 9 and above.	when should i start gaining weight during pregnancy?

most individuals with ocd experience some symptoms of the disorder indefinitely with times of improvement alternating with times of difficulty. treatments include cognitive behavioral psychotherapy behavioral therapies and medications. behavioral therapies for ocd include ritual prevention and exposure therapy. prevention of rituals involves a mental-health professional helping the ocd sufferer to endure longer and longer periods of resisting the urge to engage in compulsive behaviors. exposure therapy is the process by which the individual with ocd is put in touch with situations that tend to increase the ocd sufferer's urge to engage in compulsions then helping him or her resist that urge. cognitive/behavioral therapists help patients change the negative styles of thinking and behaving that are often associated with the anxiety involved with obsessive compulsive disorder. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are the medications that are most commonly used to treat ocd. these medications increase the amount of the neurochemical serotonin in the brain. (remember that brain serotonin levels are thought to be low in ocd. ) as their name implies the ssris work by selectively inhibiting (blocking) serotonin reuptake in the brain. ssris have fewer side effects than clomipramine an older medication that is actually thought to be somewhat more effective in treating ocd. ssris do not cause orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when sitting up or standing) and heart-rhythm disturbances like clomipramine can. therefore ssris are often the first-line treatment for this illness. examples of ssris include fluoxetine (prozac) paroxetine (paxil) sertraline (zoloft) citalopram (celexa) fluvoxamine (luvox) and escitalopram (lexapro). when the improvement that people with ocd experience is not optimal when an ssri is the only medication prescribed the addition of a neuroleptic medication like risperidone (risperdal) olanzapine (zyprexa) or aripiprazole (abilify) can sometimes be helpful. ssris are generally well tolerated and side effects are usually mild. the most common side effects are nausea diarrhea agitation insomnia and headache. however these side effects generally go away within the first month of ssri use. some patients experience sexual side effects such as decreased sexual desire (decreased libido) delayed orgasm or an inability to have an orgasm. some patients experience tremors with ssris. newer often called atypical neuroleptic medications tend to cause fewer side effects than many of the older medications in this class. the most common side effects of atypical neuroleptics include sleepiness dizziness dry mouth and weight gain. sometimes people can be more sensitive to the effects of the sun while taking these medications and therefore should take care to wear adequate sunblock whenever exposed to the sun. less commonly side effects of atypical neuroleptic medications can result in painless although abnormal muscle movements like tremors stiffness and very rarely permanent muscle twitches called tardive dyskinesia. studies on the effectiveness of treatment of ocd in adults have variable results. some indicate that medications response prevention and cbt are equally although only mildly to moderately effective in treating this problem. cognitive behavioral group therapy (cbgt) has also been found to be an effective treatment for ocd. research on treating ocd in children and adolescents suggests that while medications are clearly effective in treating this disorder the improvement that is experienced as a result is quite mild. however clomipramine tends to be more effective than the ssris and the individual ssris tend to be equally effective. as in adults people under 18 years of age tend to improve more significantly when treated with a combination of medication and cbt.	what are the treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd)?

"this must feel very distressing. i hope to at least offer some reassurance. hair loss in women is not uncommon. that said i do think you should either return to your health care provider for follow-up testing or see a different doctor. the benefit of returning to the provider you saw last time is that he or she has your medical history and past test results for comparison. many conditions including thyroid issues can cause hair loss. just because they didn't show up on your lab work a year ago doesn't mean they won't show up now. you also should know that there is a condition called ""female pattern baldness"" that affects a number of women but this doesn't usually show up until a woman reaches her 40s. i wish you all the best in finding out why your lovely locks are falling out! i am 29 yrs old and have also been experiencing very thin hair embarrassing thin hair in the front and top of my scalp as well as lowered sex drive. i've had blood tests for thyroid and low hormones and all tests came back ""normal"" but i still feel there is a big unanswered question. i've also been told that stress and pain in the body can cause this so maybe life is stressing you out a bit more than you may be willing to acknowledge? i know i deny being stressed out! however i am searching for more concrete answers just like you so if you find any helpful information to share please do! sincerely cc from s. b. there are many reasons for hair fall. if you are sure that there are no serious underlying reasons like hormonal imbalances focus on nutritional aspect. hair nourishment with essential micronutrients through oral medicines and local applications (oils/creams) would help stop your hair fall."	my hair has been falling out for almost a year now. i'm 26 yr old female. my blood tests came back normal. along w/excessive shedding my hair has been very dry. i haven't changed the way i treat my hair. i do see growth but shedding is so excessive that my hair thinned considerably since last yr. i have used spironolactone for acne 2 1/2 yrs ago. i have been off it for a little over a yr. didn't experience any bad sideeffects w/spiro. i'm not on birth control. i also have been experiencing low sex drive. my gp didn't have an answer for me. i feel hopeless<negative_smiley>

well that's difficult to say. it probably means nothing. yellow is the color we expect urine to be. if you take a vitamin supplement these can sometimes give the urine an almost fluorescent color a very bright yellow or yellow-green. that's just due to the dyes in the vitamin. if you've eaten anything recently with yellow dye in it that could also be a reason for bright yellow urine. sometimes very colorful urine indicates dehydration. the more concentrated urine is the darker or richer the color of it is. if you have no other symptoms such as pain with urination abdominal pain or lower back pain your bright yellow urine probably doesn't mean anything in terms of your overall health. if you develop any problems urinating or if the bright color persists then by all means consult a medical professional. hope this helps!	what does it mean if my urine is bright yellow?

it sure sounds like you are becoming menopausal. one test that would probably help would be to do a blood test to measure your estrogen level (estradiol) and a hormone called fsh (follicle stimulating hormone) -- made by the pituitary and as the ovaries stop working the pituitary gets working harder to try to stimulate them -- and the fsh goes up. if you are having bothersome symptoms estrogen would most likely help -- and presuming you are basically in good medical health otherwise your health-care provider could prescribe it to you. another possibility as you mentioned that you were dealing with significant depression would be an ssri type antidepressant -- it might well help with your mood and should also help some with hot flashes.	i had a partial hysterectomy in my ‘40's. at 51 i have hot flashes mood changes and depression. is this is menopause?
keep in mind that your blood pressure can vary naturally throughout the course of a day. exercise or physical activity has a tendency to raise blood pressure so refrain from taking a reading afterwards. stress can influence blood pressure too. in fact white coat hypertension is a phenomenon where the anxiety of visiting with a doctor can raise blood pressure where it wouldn’t be elevated otherwise. make sure that you are measuring your blood pressure on a regular basis and at the same time of day controlling for as many confounding variables as possible. for these reasons measuring your blood pressure first thing in the morning works well for some people. also because your blood pressure can vary it’s important to obtain many readings to observe a trend or pattern. the best way to check your blood pressure is manually through trained medical personnel. the accuracy of automated electronic blood pressure machines can vary depending on the quality of the device. some machines may need occasional calibration or maintenance too. to determine the accuracy of your home device take it with you the next time you go to the doctor and have a trained medical person measure your blood pressure manually and then compare it with your device. it is normal for blood pressure to change nearly every time you take it regardless of the time of day. the most important reading would then be the average reading so just take your bp a few times a day and write it down. as long as your average blood pressures are in the normal range minor daily fluctuations are usually not that important. my moms blood pressure is 56 over 40 what	what's best of day to check your blood pressure. my pressure changes all the time when i check it at different times. i'm 74 and a active person. thomas

you can keep from getting hiv by avoiding behaviors that might result in contact with infected blood semen or vaginal fluids. practice safe sex to prevent hiv. always use a condom during sexual activity unless you are in a relationship with one partner who does not have hiv or other sex partners. if you do have sex with someone who has hiv it is important to practice safe sex and to be regularly tested for hiv. reduce your number of sex partners preferably to one partner. talk with your sex partner or partners about their sexual history as well as your own sexual history. find out whether your partner has engaged in high-risk behaviors. avoid alcohol and drugs which can impair both your judgment and your immune system. people who know and understand safer sex practices may not practice them when they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. do not share intravenous (iv) needles syringes cookers cotton cocaine spoons or eyedroppers with others if you use drugs. if you are hiv-positive (infected with hiv) or have engaged in sex or needle-sharing with someone who could be infected with hiv take precautions to avoid spreading the infection to others. tell your sex partner or partners about your behavior and whether you are hiv-positive. follow safe sex practices such as using condoms. do not donate blood plasma semen body organs or body tissues. do not share personal items such as toothbrushes razors or sex toys that may be contaminated with blood semen or vaginal fluids. the risk of a woman spreading hiv to her baby can be greatly reduced if she is on medicine that reduces her viral load (hiv rna) to undetectable levels during pregnancy if she receives azt (zdv) before the baby is born and if she does not breast-feed her baby. the baby should also receive treatment after it is born. if you do not regularly engage in high-risk behaviors for hiv such as having unprotected sex or injecting drugs and you feel you have been exposed this way contact your doctor as soon as possible. he or she may recommend medicine if your exposure was within the past 72 hours. 7 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	how can human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection be prevented?

that depends on a variety of factors. did you use birth control? what kind of birth control was used? ovulation typically occurs on the 14th day of your cycle and sperm can live inside of you for up to 10 days so if you did have unprotected sex on may 29th there is a good chance that you could be pregnant.	last period may 16th to 19th. sex may 29th. what are the chances of pregnancy?
your doctor will diagnose psoriatic arthritis based on a physical exam patient history family history and lab tests. while there is no specific lab test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis blood tests from some patients may reveal mild anemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate or esr) is a test that gives a rough index of inflammation. the sed rate is not specific and can be elevated with many other conditions such as other autoimmune syndromes infection tumor liver disease or pregnancy. your doctor may do other blood tests such as rheumatoid factor to help exclude the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. rheumatoid factor is a blood test that is positive in 70% to 80% of those with rheumatoid arthritis. however this test may be positive in healthy people and negative in people with rheumatoid arthritis so it is not conclusive. when one or two large joints (such as knees) are inflamed arthrocentesis can be performed. arthrocentesis is an office procedure in which a sterile needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) fluid from the inflamed joints. the fluid is then analyzed for infection gout crystals and other inflammatory conditions. x-rays may show changes of cartilage or bone injury indicative of arthritis of the spine sacroiliac joints and/or joints of the hands. typical x-ray findings include bony erosions resulting from arthritis. magnetic resonance imaging tests (mri) may also be used to detect joint and tissue inflammation. the blood test for the genetic marker hla-b27 can be found in more than 50% of patients with psoriatic arthritis who have spine inflammation. because psoriatic arthritis may lead to bone loss a bone density scan may be taken to measure bone strength and to assess which patients may be at risk for osteoporosis and fractures.	how is psoriatic arthritis diagnosed?
this is a hard question to answer because there's not enough information. let me give you some general guidance. if you friend's rash came on suddenly and she is experiencing a fever she should phone (not go to) an urgent care center right away for further evaluation. sometimes a rash like you describe can indicate a serious infection. if your friend's bumps have been slowly coming on over time and she's not having any flu-like symptoms then she should see a health care provider to evaluate what might be causing this rash. many things can cause the symptoms you describe including acne. only a health care provider can say for certain what is going on and this evaluation needs to be done in person. hope this helps!	my friend has red bumps all over her chest and now it has spread to her arms and face. some of them get white heads and she pops them and they just bleed alot.

"i'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. what is happening to you is called ""early satiety "" meaning you are getting full early in the eating process. when this happens it's best to see your doctor and describe your symptoms so he or she can run some tests. it could be gastro-intestinal (gi) related such as irritable bowel or gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) or something else entirely. you need to find out what's going on as you are likely not getting adequate nutrition and no doubt your quality life is suffering. good luck!"	i get nauseous everytime after i eat what's wrong? . i can be starving and i will eat after about half way through (even a small plate) my stomach hurts really bad like i over ate. sometimes it's only a few bites then i feel very nauseous and i am unable to eat the rest of the day.

i am sorry but you did not post sufficient information in order to answer this very patient-specific question. i don't know what kind of irregular cells or what the pathologist is suggesting. if there is a concern about a possible skin cancer then yes those irregular cells may need to be excised. at this point only your dermatologist can address this question.	a bioposy to remove a spot on my face found irregular cells present. is it necessary to surgically remove these cells?
stage 2 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm hg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm hg or higher. blood pressure is expressed as the systolic blood pressure “over” the diastolic blood pressure. for example normal blood pressure is “120 over 80”. assigning “stages” to blood pressure was the idea of a national committee dedicated to raising awareness and treatment of hypertension. in their system stage 1 is blood pressure that’s high (140-to-159 systolic or 90-to-99 diastolic) but not as high as in stage 2. the higher stage expresses the more serious health risks from untreated severe high blood pressure. however some experts argue that the term “stage” is misleading because it suggests that blood pressure steadily gets worse in stages which is not always the case.	what is stage 2 hypertension? . stage 2 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm hg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm hg or higher. blood pressure is expressed as the systolic blood pressure “over” the diastolic blood pressure. for example normal blood pressure is “120 over 80”.
first congratulations on taking this important first step in reducing your weight to a healthy level! i salute you. second be sure you've received the ok from your health care provider to undertake a diet and exercise program. if your doctor has cleared you to exercise then your shortness of breath may be normal simply due to your current size. don't let this discourage you. it may not be realistic for you to expect to perform say 20 minutes of aerobic activity at this point. that time will come. right now 2 minutes might actually be more realistic for you. i'd suggest you start with simply walking. if you can manage to walk for 2 minutes 10 times a day there's your 20 minutes. do that every day and you'll gradually build up stamina. if you've been watching one of those television shows where 300+ pound people engage in vigorous workouts and lose dramatic amounts of weight quickly i'd suggest you stop watching. in my opinion those programs do not depict a realistic vision of exercise for people who weigh over 300 pounds. the workouts shown on those programs are closely monitored by an entire medical team and can be dangerous for the average unsupervised exerciser. again i can't stress how much i admire you for your determination. try checking out webmd's diet community for support and access to experts who can help you on your journey. be patient. it may take you quite some time to lose all the weight you want to lose. remember to set intermediate goals and rewards along the way to stay motivated. best wishes to you! don’t give up! although you may not be able to exercise for long now you should expect to see less shortness of breath and better cardiovascular endurance the longer you stay consistent with your exercise routine. be sure that you’re not trying to do too much with your exercise. it may be best to start out with a low intensity level of exercise and expanding upon it as tolerated. it may not seem like a lot at first but you can slowly and gradually build up the duration and intensity of your exercise the more that you are able to adhere to it. remember your exercise doesn’t have to be done all in one session. divide it up and takes breaks to rest and recover if you need to and then pick it back up later. you may be able to continually shorten the amount of rest that you take in between sessions to eventually spend more time in a single session. also try building in more opportunities to incorporate more physically activity within your daily routine. try taking the stairs instead of the elevator or park further away. making a habit out of incorporating small opportunities like these can ultimately lead to becoming better conditioned for exercise. if exercise remains to be too difficult i’d still encourage you to continue to do what you can but i’d suggest placing more of an emphasis on your nutrition to lose enough weight until you’re at the point that you can exercise more comfortably. keep up the great work! remember to always consult your doctor before beginning an exercise routine or weight loss plan. please keep one thing in mind. you did not gain the weight over a few months so don't expect it to magically fall off in a few months; there are no shortcuts just dedication and the will power you will need to get your butt off the couch and head outside (or treadmill) and walk everyday. at first just do what you can but make a training schedule and follow it - you are accountable to no one but yourself so don't let yourself down! i will not do you any favors by lying to you or telling you loosing weight is easy. as you know it is not. it is a long hard journey to loose the weight but if your mindset is right and your willpower is strong (do it for no one but yourself). then you are on your way to a successful weight loss journey! good luck! btw. before putting something in your mouth ask yourself if you are really hungry if you are not - ask yourself why you are eating. congrats on this big step in life! you can do it! however to safely do it i would go to your local ymca and have a professional check you out( your heart rate ect. ) they will put you on a plan that fits you!	im 314lbs and trying to lose weight. i cant excercise 2 min before im gasping for air. how can i get a work out in?
im my opinion. your problem is about absorption. taking vitamin b12 supplement can help absorption from gut. proteins and soluble carbohydrates tend to improve copper absorption and bioavailability by enhancing its solubility and intestinal bulk flow. organic acids other than ascorbic acid or agents that form low-molecular-weight chelates are likely to have a positive effect on overall copper absorption.

i wish there was an easy diet answer for ibs sufferers but you are going to have to do some investigative work to find what and how much of certain foods you have trouble tolerating. that being said most people with ibs have problems with greasy foods spicy foods caffeine-containing beverages (coffee and tea) and alcohol. certain foods can increase gastrointestinal discomfort when eaten in large amounts such as beans cabbage cauliflower peas and brussels sprouts. most ibs sufferers do better with smaller frequent meals (5-6 times daily) instead of big meals less frequently (2-3 big meals). i recommend you see registered dietitian (rd) that performs elimination diets such as fodmaps (fermentable oligo- di- and monosaccharides and polyols). he or she will help you identify if you are sensitive to certain carbohydrates in foods making your symtpoms worse. an rd can not only help you choose a diet that is tolerated but one that meets your nutritional needs. to find a dietitian new you go to eatright. org. this article provides more information on finding the right diet for ibs <link> good luck!	diagnosed with ibs that goes back and forth between diarrhea and constipation what should i eat and not eat?

couples should consider seeing a doctor if they have been trying to conceive for a year without success (6 months for women over 35). the beginnings of a fertility evaluation focus on eggs tubes and sperm. with regards to eggs your doctor will want to confirm that you are releasing your egg and determine how many eggs remain. signs that you are releasing an egg are regular predictable menstrual cycles positive ovulation predictor kits shifts in basal body temperature and/or a high progesterone level approximately one week before your period. ovarian reserve the number of eggs remaining in the ovary can be evaluated with blood tests (fsh amh) and ultrasound for antral follicle count. fallopian tubes can be evaluated by a hysterosalpingogram an x-ray test where x-ray dye is injected into the cervix. the x-ray shows the cavity of the uterus and whether the tubes are open. sperm are evaluated with a semen analysis to look for sperm number and motion. if a semen analysis is not normal it will be repeated to rule out normal fluctuations. if it is normal either the first or second time no further evaluation is needed. if it is abnormal twice you will be referred to urology for further evaluation. the next steps in fertility evaluation and treatment will be based on results to the above tests. while these tests can identify some fertility factors mother nature is more complex. occasionally all the tests will be normal despite a continued delay to pregnancy. therefore your doctor will discuss fertility treatment in the context of the evaluation you have completed.	when should we consider a fertility evaluation and what is involved?

i'm sorry to hear of your husband's health problems. it's difficult when they begin to stack up like that. several things could cause your husband's ears to turn purple when he lies down. the most likely thing is a lack of oxygen due to congestive heart failure. you might see if propping up his head and back on extra pillows makes the purple ears go away. this is something you should talk to your husband's doctor about. because it started happening recently your husband's doctor will want to know about it. i suggest you call for an appointment. hope this helps! take care.	my husband ears are turning purple when he laids down. what can cause this? . my husband had a stroke in 2007. lung surgery in 2010 to remove fluid. in 2011 he had a defiblalator put in. he had several congested heart faluire after his stroke in 2007. but just all of a sudden this week his ears started turning purple when he would lay down. he also has hepatitis c. thank you dorothy h
most helpful answer symptoms of poison ivy reactions to the skin in dogs can include raised bumps or swelling of the skin. the dog may become very itchy and the skin may also become inflamed. i'm a little late to the game but yes dogs can get poison ivy with a similar reaction that humans get. and don't forget that the dog can pass the oil to you and then you can get poison ivy if you're sensitive to it. if your dog has been in an area that you know has poison ivy or off in the woods where there is likely to be poison ivy you should wash their coat immediately and be sure not to touch the dog yourself until all the oil from the poison ivy plant is washed off. dogs definitely can get poison ivy it's just pretty rare. it's because it has to get past their fur or be ingested to even come in contact with the dog in a way that could affect them. most of the time pets can recive poison ivy just don't pet them until its gone if they are itchy it's probably fleas. imo they cannot get poison ivy.	can a dog get poison ivy?
"orchitis would be higher on the list than a testicular cancer but both need to be considered. you need a testicular ultrasound (doppler) as soon as you can get it and of course a visit to a urologist. testicular cancer does not really act like this. it is not very helpful to worry unnecessarily about these things until you get a diagnosis. i am sorry that i cannot be more specific but making these ""blind"" guesses is not something that medical professionals are fond of doing. we like to see these problems first-hand look at the imaging studies and then and only then make a presumptive diagnosis. hang in there my friend (no pun intended)."	one of my testices has always been larger. but recently it has grown much larger and hurts (dull pain). so i have always had a larger testicle (the right one) and that has never been an issue. but over the past 2 months it has grown far larger. roughly double the original size. i am going in for tests in about a week. so my real question is that what else besides testiclar cancer coud be causeing this. trying to stay possitive and hoping its nothing that serious. also the pain has come and gone in the past but for no more than a day in the past. but the last two weeks it has hurt fairly constantly
maybe. it would be a good idea for you to have your doctor order a varicella titer -- a test to determine if you have immunity to chicken pox. if your titer is low or non-existent then yes exposure to the herpes virus (the cause of both shingles and herpes) either from someone with chicken pox or direct contact to someone who has active shingles can cause you to get chicken pox.	i had 3 chckn pox on my abd when i 3 so did my sister she got them again when exposed and i didn't can i still get them? . i'm now 29 and trying to conceive and one of my co workers was just diagnosed with shingles. could i get chicken pox from her shingles?

just give it a rest my friend. it is not likely that you cause testicular damage from overly-masturbating but you can cause enough trauma to have discomfort. if your symptoms persist you will need to see your medical provider but i suspect a few days of rest and recuperation will give our over-worked boys time to completely recover.	i have a small dull ache in my left testicle after i masturbated too much. i'm 18 years of age anyway i masturbated way more than usual during the week it occurred i'm not that worried as i have searched for lumps or mass and everything seems ok. an answer would be much appreciated

it is great that you have had exellent results from your surgical procedures. you are wise to try to get moving and active again. being fit and active is the best thing that you can do to prevent future problems with your back. however it is important that you develop a progressive aerobic and strengthening regimen. i would suggest that you contact your surgeon for a referral to a spine physical therapist who can help you get started on your return to exercise. in general you want to avoid impact type exercises so the elliptical is a reasonable option. you should also avoid any heavy weights particularly free weights above your head that will cause compression to the spine. i usually recommend that spine patients use the weight machines that use resistence mechanisms or weights on tracks with pulleys. these are less likey to injury you. you also need to do regular core muscle strengthening. again a physical therapist can help you get started. pilates is the commercial exercise course that is most similar to a core strengthening program.	i have had two back surgeries and am pain-free except for some stiffness. what exercises can i do to play tennis again?

nosebleeds (epistaxis) can be a sign of many different medical conditions but what you have described in your brief postings -- those specks of blood -- does not sound very serious. please keep in mind that i do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of delving into your specific case. the nasopharynx is very rich in blood supply so it does not take much for it to bleed. in the vast majority of cases this is not an ominous sign. seeing your doctor in a few weeks is fine.	at 30 i had my first-ever nose bleed. then i had another with a small amount of blood. could it be serious?

at 10 months the fusion should be doing quite well under most circumstances. also a spinal fusion today usually involves a permanent spacer that's screwed to the vertebrae and this is very durable. however certain groups (like smokers or those who take certain medications) may have slower-healing fusions than others. if you're concerned that you injured your fusion you'd be wise to call your surgeon's office for an appointment or at least to speak to the nurse or physician assistant by phone. hope this helps!	i have had a multi-level spinal fusion done 10 months ago is it possible to damage the fusion or is it muscle strain

i think probiotics are fine and not harmful over the long term. as you know they contain friendly yeast and bacteria that are normally found in the body's intestines; called normal flora. they do not contain harmful or potentially dangerous mixtures of organisms. if there is an imbalance in our normal flora probiotics can help correct the problem especially with candida overgrowth. the body will basically incorporate whatever it needs from the probiotic pills to rebalance the flora. if we have chronic problems then regular probiotics may be needed and helpful. if we are balanced and still take probiotics that may not be needed at that time the body should simply pass it through with no harm done. if my patients feel they help i have no problem if they continue taking probiotics.	is it safe to take probiotics long-term?
when looking for a therapist it is important to find one that is qualified affordable and that you can connect well with. when you first talk with a therapist (either on the phone or in person) consider it an interview to see if the person is right for you. ask about their credentials making sure that they are a licensed psychiatrist psychologist social worker or counselor. offer a thumbnail sketch of your issue and ask if this is the kind of issue that they treat and have expertise with. ask what their approach is and why they think it would be helpful for you. as you listen to these answers think about whether you feel comfortable not only with what they are saying but also with how they are saying it. in terms of finding someone you can afford you might want to try a local clinic hospital or teaching institution (a school that trains therapists might have its own clinic) because they might have a sliding scale. although those in training are less experienced (a downside) and might make you think twice about going they also receive supervision-- and sometimes the training is for experienced people working on a more advanced degree. again if you feel comfortable that is most important (along with proper qualifications). you might want to check with the self-help support group clearinghouse for both self-help groups and recommendations for where to seek sliding scale professional help. try the state or local professional associations (i. e. for psychologists or social workers) and ask if they can direct you. and whoever you call for help if they cannot help ask if they can direct you as to where to get help.	how can i find a reasonably priced qualified mental health counselor?
let me try to help you out here. you ask a very good question. first let me tell you i know of no link between use of sanitary pads and ovarian cancer. perhaps the person who told you that was thinking of toxic shock syndrome which can occur when women use super-absorbent tampons and do not change them frequently enough. because you use pads toxic shock syndrome is not a major concern for you. for purely hygienic purposes i'd recommend changing your pad every four to five hours no matter how saturated it may be. the same goes for panty liners when used toward the end of your period when the flow is very light. changing pads fairly frequently will help you feel cleaner and avoid any odor problems. i hope this answers your question!	when to replace a sanitary pad during periods? . if a pad does not get saturated after many hrs than it should be replaced or not? i need to know the time/ hrs after a pad should be replaced because i've heard that a pad should be replaced after 5 hrs otherwise it can cause ovarian cancer because blood mix with gel & make a substance that is harmful i want to know is that true?

"atopic dermatitis is generally easily diagnosed based on a physical exam and visual inspection of the skin by a physician or dermatologist. additionally the history given by the patient and contributory family history help to support the diagnosis. a doctor may ask about any history of similar rashes and other medical problems including hay fever (allergies) and asthma. while currently there may be no single specific laboratory test that says unequivocally ""this is atopic dermatitis "" a skin biopsy (a sample of a small piece of skin that is sent to the lab for examination under the microscope) may be helpful to establish the diagnosis in harder cases. additionally gentle skin swabs (long cotton tip applicator or q-tip) samples may be sent to the lab to exclude infections of the skin which may mimic atopic dermatitis. since itching tends to be the main common symptom of the disease for many patients it is not possible to say all itching is atopic dermatitis. itching may be seen in many other medical conditions that have nothing to do with eczema. each patient experiences a unique combination of symptoms and the symptoms and severity of the disease may vary over time. the doctor bases the diagnosis on the individual's symptoms and may need to see the patient several times to make an accurate diagnosis. it is important for the doctor to rule out other diseases and conditions that might cause skin irritation. in some cases the family doctor or pediatrician may refer the patient to a dermatologist or allergist (allergy specialist) for further evaluation. a valuable diagnostic tool is a thorough medical history which provides important clues as to the possible causes of the patient's ailment. the doctor may ask about all of the following: a family history of allergic disease whether the patient also has diseases such as hay fever or asthma exposure to irritants sleep disturbances any foods that seem to be related to skin flares previous treatments for skin-related symptoms use of steroids and the effects of symptoms on schoolwork career or social life. sometimes it is necessary to do a biopsy of the skin or patch testing to determine if the skin's immune system overreacts to certain chemicals or preservatives in skin creams. a preliminary diagnosis of atopic dermatitis can be made if the patient has three or more characteristics from each of two categories: major features and minor features. some of these characteristics are listed in the box below. skin scratch/prick tests (which involve scratching or pricking the skin with a needle that contains a small amount of a suspected allergen) and blood tests for airborne allergens generally are not as useful in diagnosing atopic dermatitis as a medical history and careful observation of symptoms. however they may occasionally help the doctor rule out or confirm a specific allergen that might be considered important in the diagnosis. negative results on skin tests are reliable and may help rule out the possibility that certain substances are causing skin inflammation in the patient. however positive skin scratch/prick test results are difficult to interpret in people with atopic dermatitis and are often inaccurate. in some cases where the type of dermatitis is unclear blood tests to check the level of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) or ige (an antibody whose levels are often high in atopic dermatitis) are helpful. major and minor features of atopic dermatitis major features itching characteristic rash in locations typical of the disease (arm folds and behind knees) chronic or repeatedly occurring symptoms personal or family history of atopic disorders (eczema hay fever asthma) some minor features early age of onset dry rough skin high levels of immunoglobulin e (ige) an antibody in the blood ichthyosis hyper linear palms keratosis pilaris hand or foot dermatitis cheilitis (dry or irritated lips) nipple eczema susceptibility to skin infection positive allergy skin tests"	how is atopic dermatitis diagnosed?
whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred. when inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade (99. 9 oral temperature) fever due to the body working hard to heal itself. sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual. as for the chest pain it could be associated with his arm being hurt but it depends on how he fell how far he fell and exactly how he landed. he could have injured more than originally thought. for temporary relief he should try r. i. c. e. (rest ice compression elevation) and perhaps some ibuprofen (motrin advil) to reduce swelling/pain/fever. acetaminophine (tylenol) should be fine as well if that works better for him but it doesn't have an anti-inflammatory component like ibuprofen does. ultimately the best thing to do is to see a physician just to be certain that everything is alright and there isn't something more serious occurring. most urgent care facilities will see you same day with or without insurance. emergency departments will as well but they are usually more congested and expensive. i hope this helps. best of luck to you!	"can a broken bone or a muscle tear cause a fever? . my father fell a month ago and has been experiencing pain in the arm he fell on. he won't go to a doctor because he does not have insurance. just this week he said he had a sweating spell and has been feeling ""under the weather"" for a few days. no other symptoms then he thinks he had a fever and even muscles in chest ache. so i am not sure if he just caught some virus or if maybe something from his fell is trying to tell his body."

hirsutism is male-pattern hair growth in women. excess hair may be on the upper lip chest back or elsewhere. causes of hirsutism include: polycystic ovary syndrome (most common) congenital adrenal hyperplasia (an inherited adrenal gland disorder) drug side effects hereditary (genetic) cushing's syndrome cancer most women with hirsutism have polycystic ovary syndrome characterized by irregular periods (or none) and multiple cysts visible on the ovaries on an ultrasound. only a small fraction of women have some other hormone imbalance. these are usually easily detected by lab tests in the supervision of an endocrinologist internist or family doctor. remember that normal hair growth patterns in women vary by race and ethnicity: don’t let an airbrushed magazine ideal fool you into a false self-diagnosis of hirsutism.	what causes hirsutism?
your health care costs may go up -- they tend to every year -- but not much of the higher costs are likely to be because of health reform. employers continue to shift more health care costs onto employees as a way of keeping their own costs under control. and despite the high cost because employers tend to cover a big portion of your premium and because your employer-sponsored health insurance is a tax-free benefit it's often the best deal in town. still you may want to consider other plan options if your employer gives you a choice. there may be another alternative that will cost you less money but still cover your medical needs. you can read further about employer vs. marketplace plans at the health reform 101 blog: <link>.	my wife and myself are insured through her employer's health insurance plan. . we pay over $800 per month for coverage. will we be paying more or less or will the new laws affect it?
human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg) is a pregnancy hormone present in your blood from the time of conception and is produced by the cells that form the placenta. this is the hormone detected in a pregnancy test; but it usually takes three to four weeks from the first day of your last period for the levels of hcg to be high enough to be detected by pregnancy tests. the development stages of pregnancy are called trimesters or three-month periods because of the distinct changes that occur in each stage.	what are pregnancy hormones?

for decades some women have used lactobacillus acidophilus in yogurt or supplements to treat bacterial vaginosis. but dairy lactobacillus does not work for bacterial vaginosis. this is because dairy lactobacillus is not the kind of bacteria that normally live in the vagina. 8 researchers are studying the two different types of lactobacillus- l. crispatus and l. jensenii -that are most commonly found in a healthy vagina. 7 these lactobacilli may prove to be an effective treatment for bacterial vaginosis. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what can i do to treat bacterial vaginosis at home?

alcohol has been implicated in infertility early miscarriage as well as in birth defects. the amount of alcohol consumption necessary to cause these problems is not known and varies among women. some women can drink excessively and have normal infants. others consume considerably less alcohol but still give birth to babies with cognitive disabilities and/or other birth defects. it is generally believed that the greater the amount of alcohol consumed during pregnancy the greater the risk of pregnancy-related problems and birth defects. it is recommended that pregnant women avoid all consumption of alcohol. fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a group of conditions reflecting the possible effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. the fasds include fetal alcohol syndrome (fas) alcohol-related birth defects (arbd) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disabilities (arnd). fetal alcohol syndrome (fas) is the extreme end of the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and is a leading cause of cognitive disabilities.	how does alcohol affect pregnancy?

if you are exposed to carbon monoxide or if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected your doctor will ask questions about your medical history. questions may include how long symptoms have been present what the source of possible exposure to carbon monoxide is how many other people (family members or coworkers) have the same symptoms and what home heating and cooking appliances have been used. with this information your doctor may decide that a test for carbon monoxide is necessary. the standard test for carbon monoxide measures the amount of hemoglobin that has bonded with carbon monoxide. this amount is also called the carboxyhemoglobin (cohb) level. testing should never delay treatment. treatment should be started as soon as possible. other tests such as an arterial blood gas (abg) and a complete blood count (cbc) also may be done if you have or are suspected of having carbon monoxide poisoning. these tests may be done to evaluate your overall health or to identify problems caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. a handheld breath analyzer measures how much carbon monoxide is in the air you exhale. this test measures high levels of the gas but may not be reliable in detecting low levels. other tests questionnaires and other tests may be used to detect subtle changes in your ability to think clearly if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected. they also may be used to determine what other treatment is needed. if you do have carbon monoxide poisoning you will probably have tests to check for heart damage such as ecg and cardiac enzyme studies. early detection there is no routine screening for carbon monoxide poisoning. if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected further tests will be done. in the winter months carbon monoxide poisoning may be suspected in people who go to the emergency room with symptoms of a severe headache nausea or dizziness. information about a person's home workplace and any illness of family members and coworkers is often gathered to determine whether a test for carbon monoxide should be done. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for carbon monoxide poisoning?
thank you for the interesting question. i completely understand your logic. the laws are changing every day in the field of fertility. in the lab setting it has become common practice to increase the number of potentially viable eggs therby expanding the odds of pregnancy occurring. another example of these changes may be seen in the long held belief that a woman is born with a finite quantity of eggs at birth. this principle is being questioned in an animal study. please open the following link to a webmd article that discusses that study. <link> - although i’m not an expert in fertility issues i’ll share with you what i know to be accurate as follows: the number of follicles that will ever become a mature egg is partially dependent on the monthly cycle where a varying and undetermined number of follicles (potentially mature eggs) estimated to probably be in the neighborhood of 1 000 is lost. this follicle loss is also influenced by hormonal variations. the number of follicles remaining each month after the monthly cycle will influence the potential number of mature eggs in a woman’s lifetime. the more follicles that are lost monthly the sooner that the follicle supply will become exhausted and menopause will begin. with all of the advances in fertility it does not seen yet possible to calculate the number of remaining mature eggs after the monthly cycle.	when a woman is pregnant for 9 months does she save 9 eggs for 9 future ovulations?

hi. thanks for writing to us. well uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths of the uterus that often appear during childbearing years. also called leiomyomas or myomas uterine fibroids aren’t associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and almost never develop into cancer. so please do not worry about cancer and even your biopsies are sufficient to confirm that you are not having any cancer or even not at a risk. so simply relax. at times fibroids even shrink in menopausal ages so you can continue to monitor it but still you are not at a risk of developing cancer. hope this information helps. regards.

most cold medicines are pregnancy category b meaning there is no good proof that they are safe and no good proof that they’re not. certain cold medicines such as pseudoephedrine and phenlyephrine are category c meaning that animal studies have shown a risk to the fetus but human studies are lacking. there is a chance of fetal harm if the drug is administered during pregnancy but the potential benefits may outweigh the potential risk. acetaminophen (tylenol) is good at reducing fever and aches and is widely considered safe during pregnancy (although it has not been assigned to a preganancy category by the fda). ibuprofen naproxen and other nsaids are pregnancy category c. heated humidified air is safe and helpful for reducing nasal congestion. colds get better on their own. cold medicines don’t shorten the duration of a cold. and in clinical studies most cold medicines only reduce symptoms slightly. the cold does not pose any additional risk to the baby. all pregnant women should get the influenza vaccine during flu season which is safe for both mother and baby. catching the flu during pregnancy can be serious. many obstetricians are comfortable recommending common cold medicines that are probably safe during pregnancy. if you’re too miserable to make it through your cold symptoms call your doctor and ask what he or she recommends. what cold medication can pregnant women take for sore throat?	what can a pregnant woman take for a cold?

never stop an antidepressant if you are still depressed. if you have been depression-free a few years then it may be time to come off the antidepressants. always come off them slowly. with paxil maybe over 2-3 months. . it takes several weeks for antidepressants to work so it may take several weeks for them to wear off but the withdrawal effects can occur within a few days and this is not a depression but a withdrawal side effect. sometimes we put patients on prozac to detox them off paxil if the withdrawal side effects are too tough.	i want to stop taking paxil but have tried and at the 10-day mark it's take it or go to a hospital. what should i do?

"probably not. in the first place your pediatrician would have advised you whether or not you should be concerned. obviously he or she did not. second receiving an extra immunization dose isn't really considered a health hazard. your baby probably will exhibit the usual symptoms of having been vaccinated: irritability possibly an elevated temperature temporarily. but these symptoms should pass within a couple of days as normal. the varicella vaccine is not a ""live"" vaccine meaning it does not contain a live virus that can infect your baby. the only likely side effect of receiving a double dose is that it will rev up your baby's immune system a little more vigorously. if your baby has any abnormal symptoms after the weekend give your pediatrician a call for peace of mind. but i don't think you'll have anything to worry about. hope this helps!"	dr accidentally gave our 12 mo old a double dose of varicella. should we be concerned?

there are a lot of associations in medicine. if you have x condition you’re likely to suffer from y as well. if you’re at risk for a you’re also at risk for b and probably c as well. now we have a new connection to consider in my realm: it appears that patients with fibromyalgia have a high prevalence of rls — restless leg syndrome. fibromyalgia is a condition that affects the muscles and soft tissue. it’s considered the most common arthritis-related illness after osteoarthritis and its hallmark symptoms include chronic pain in the muscles fatigue sleep problems and painful tender points or trigger points at certain parts of the body. it can be difficult to diagnose because there is no single test for the ailment which is why doctors have to rule out other conditions before diagnosing fibromyalgia. more than 12 million americans have fibromyalgia. most of them are women ranging in age from 25 to 60. women are 10 times more likely to get this disease than men. because of the toll fibromyalgia takes on people physically it’s no surprise that patients have a harder time getting a good night’s sleep as they endure chronic aches and pain. but the link found between fibro patients and rls is intriguing. fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome share certain features: * women are more likely to suffer from fibromyalgia and rls. * there appears to be a genetic component because these conditions run in families. rls is equally a mysterious disorder in the sense that we don’t know exactly what causes it and as such we don’t have a magic bullet for curing it in everyone. sometimes an iron deficiency can be to blame for which there is a clear remedy. but many patients with rls do not fit into a tidy category whereby the direct cause is known. other problems that are sometimes linked to restless legs syndrome include kidney failure rheumatoid arthritis diabetes nerve damage anemia and parkinson’s disease but most people who seek treatment do not have any of these other problems. pregnancy accounts for many rls cases (and contributes to the gender disparity) and women who get rls during pregnancy often find that the condition vanishes after giving birth. the scientists who published the study on this association pointed out that fibromyalgia and rls share several characteristics. both conditions can include sensory alterations the use of antidepressants that can influence the dopamine system and beneficial effects for exercise. what’s more an important implication of the study according to the researchers is that restless legs syndrome is treatable with drugs that change the dopamine patterns in the brain. physicians are urged to ask fibromyalgia patients about symptoms such as leg movements when they are trying to sleep and unpleasant sensations in their legs. it goes without saying that alleviating these symptoms can enhance a fibromyalgia patient’s experience with sleep and overall quality of life. and it also should be noted that the recommendations for fibro patients are similar to those who seek relief from rls (or any sleep disorder for that matter). they include: * avoiding tobacco alcohol and caffeine. * getting regular exercise. * keeping your bedroom cool quiet and comfortable. the two problems with this study? for one the researchers determined the presence of rls among their participants through questionnaires. they weren’t able to factor out people with rls that can be attributed to medications they were taking at the time. and second because of the cross-sectional design of the study the researchers could not ascertain a simple cause-and-effect relationship. put simply further research is necessary to clarify a potential causal relationship between the fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome. i am however excited to see research in this area linking these two mysterious disorders and i look forward to more research.	is there a connection between fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome?
the transit time is quite variable in all people. there are no set times. food can remain in the stomach for two hours or so then progressively travel into the intestinal tract where it may process for several hours. or days. in babies the transit time is surprisingly rapid. babies often poop while you are feeding them! in some adults the transit time can be days especially in older people or people prone to constipation. transit time can be influenced by the type of food ingested the volume/size of meal the amount of water/fluids and the amount of fiber/solids. spicy food may be faster than you anticipated. a heavy thanksgiving dinner may bloat you for a day or more. this is a very interesting question. there are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system. to start the type of food matters. some foods are more complex requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them. on the other hand other foods won’t have to go through such a rigorous process and may be digested and metabolized relatively quickly. fiber for example has a decreased intestinal transit time which means that it spends less time in your intestines and may be passed through faster than something else. the answer also could depend on other factors like age ethnicity and gender. you have to consider that people’s digestive systems can be different or work in slightly different ways. did you know that some people have longer intestines than other people? certainly that might influence how long it takes for food to digest. also individuals may have different levels of microbes present in their intestines that can influence how food is digested too. how long it takes food to digest depends on a lot of different factors. dosent it only takes 30 mins?	how long does it take for food to pass through the stomach and small intestine to the large intestine?

most healthy children teens and adults with chickenpox (varicella) need only home treatment. but all teens and adults with chickenpox need to see a doctor. call first to make an appointment and to discuss whether you need to take any steps to avoid spreading the virus when you arrive. for example office staff may take you straight to an exam room rather than have you wait in the lobby. if you have chickenpox you do not need to stay in bed but you should stay quiet and rest. you can take oral over-the-counter medicines to treat symptoms such as fever and itching. before giving medicine to your sick child check with your child's doctor. because of their small size children are more sensitive than adults to the effects of some medicines. use a measuring spoon or medicine cup to give liquid medicine to a child; do not guess the amount or use a regular table spoon. reduce itching the chickenpox rash itches. scratching the blisters may cause a skin infection or scars to form after the blisters heal. you can take steps at home to control itching such as taking oatmeal baths applying cool compresses and taking antihistamines by mouth. check with your child's doctor before giving your child antihistamines. monitor fever fever is your body's normal response to infection. a higher-than-normal temperature kills bacteria and viruses that cause illness. medicines that reduce fever stop this natural process so they should be used only as needed. if a child with chickenpox does not act sick or complain of symptoms you may choose not to give medicine for fever. call your health professional if your child's fever lasts longer than 48 hours. you can help reduce a fever by using nonprescription medications and drinking cool liquids. if you are not sure about the amount of medicine to give your child talk to your doctor or pharmacist. ( do not give aspirin to people younger than 20 because of the risk of reye syndrome ). prevent the spread of infection chickenpox can spread easily from one person to another. if you have frequent and close contact with a person infected with chickenpox such as a family member you may be exposed to a large amount of the virus. as a result you may develop a more severe illness than the person who spread it. you also may be at greater risk for complications from the illness especially if you have an impaired immune system. to prevent the spread of chickenpox you or your child should stay home from work or school when ill. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what can i do to treat chickenpox varicella at home?

"cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in the body. these extra cells grow together and form masses called tumors. in colorectal cancer these growths usually start as polyps in the large intestine ( colon or rectum). colon polyps are quite common and most do not cause problems. but if they are not detected and removed some of them can turn into cancer. cancers in the colon or rectum usually grow very slowly. it takes most of them years to become large enough to cause symptoms. if the cancer is allowed to grow it eventually will invade and destroy nearby tissues and then spread farther. colorectal cancer spreads first to nearby lymph nodes. from there it may spread to other parts of the body usually the liver. it may also spread to the lungs and less often to the bones and the brain. the long-term outcome or prognosis for colorectal cancer depends on how much the cancer has grown and spread. experts talk about prognosis in terms of ""5-year survival rates. "" the 5-year survival rate means the percentage of people who are still alive 5 years or longer after their cancer was discovered. it is important to remember that these are only averages. everyone's case is different and these numbers do not necessarily show what will happen to you. the estimated 5-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is: 1 90% or more if cancer is found early and treated before it has spread. 67% if the cancer has spread to nearby organs and lymph nodes. 10% if the cancer has spread to the liver lungs or bones. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."	what happens to someone when they get colorectal cancer?

anyone with a colon can get colorectal cancer – a collective term that includes both colon cancer and rectal cancer. in the united states it’s the third most common serious cancer in men and women. it's estimated that over 24 000 men died from colorectal cancer in 2008 making it the third leading cause of cancer death in men after lung and prostate cancers. and new evidence suggests that men may benefit more than women from earlier colorectal cancer screening. overall only about 6% of men in the u. s. develop colorectal cancer but several factors increase your risk: age: men younger than 40 almost never develop colorectal cancer. over 90% of the cases are in men over 50. family history: if people in your immediate family or near relations had colorectal cancer at a young age you should be screened earlier. previous colorectal cancer: if you've had cancer removed already you're at higher risk to develop a new one. inflammatory bowel disease: if you have had a condition such as crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis for several years your risk of colorectal cancer goes up. other conditions that appear to raise the risk of colorectal cancer include: drinking more than two alcoholic drinks per day obesity smoking diabetes a high-fat diet with fat coming mostly from meat.	which men are at a risk for colorectal cancer?

the most common cause of bad odor coming from the vagina is a condition called bacterial vaginosis also called gardnerella. the odor stems from an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the vagina that causes a strong fishy odor. the odor is worse after intercourse because the ph of the semen causes more of the odor to be released. prescription pills or cream can usually eliminate the bacterial imbalance. in premenopausal women a not uncommon cause of bad odor is a forgotten tampon. removal of the tampon will correct the problem. gentle cleansing of the vulva with clean water is usually sufficient for hygiene. any soap can be irritating to the vulva and in some cases can cause dermatitis skin irritation or rash. in most cases douching is not recommended. a very strong or unusual odor should be evaluated by a clinician. yes; i was taken off of estrogen without a gradual stop- just kind of cold turkey. i had one intercourse experience after a year of being off estrogen and the odor came. my general health care provider could not help me. i found a gynocologist who would see me.

the tonsils may have little holes or crypts in them that can trap food and other debris. sometimes this debris can calcify and create a little stone-like mass called a tonsilliths (tonsil stone). since i have no way of seeing your little white spot first-hand it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to give you an exact answer based solely on your brief description. it is possible to have localized infections so since you are concerned it would be in your best interest to have your tonsils examined by a health care professional. since you are just getting over a cold it is certainly possible that it is evidence of an infection on your tonsil. one concern would be strep throat. however if you have strep your throat is typically quite sore with fever and oftentimes swollen glands in the front of your neck. if you feel fine otherwise strep throat is less likely. however if it doesn't go away after a few days get your doctor to check it out. another possibility is a tonsil stone. however since you had a cold recently the above is more likely. but here's more information about tonsil stones im not a doctor so dont take my word as gold but i get these little white spots on my tonsils too they irritate me like crazy one evening i had enough so i took a flash light and went into the bathroom and took my fingernail and poked at it and it popped out of the tonsil. and it stopped bothering me. i still get them a lot but i just go in there and get it out i think its like the first answer on here like a calcification.	i have a white spot about the size of a large grain of rice in the back of my throat on my tonsil of the left side. its a small white spot but it is very easy to see upon emamination. i have just gotten over a cold that did start with a very sore throat but that was about a a week ago now. there is only a spot on one side of my throat. i'm worried its some kind of infection. i can touch the area with my tonge and it is much warmer on that side of my throat than the other side. it is mildly irrated.
any time that you have unprotected sex the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. since you hade a tubal ligation 14 years ago most of these are 100% successful in achieving surgical sterilization so that chance of pregnancy while not impossible is remote. since some tubal ligations fail (for various reasons) other causes for your array of symptoms like hormonal fluctuations should be medically-investigated by a gynecologist.	tubes tied 14years ago 2001 its 2015 now. need help. i am 40yrs old and just got out of a 8yr lesbian relationship. had sex 13day ago and my period is 8day late. i have all signs i am pregnant like tender breast bloating wipe myself had a lil brown on it spewed twice did pregnancy test in the afternoon on monday came up negative. could i be pregnant.

if your doctor suspects you have gallstones he or she will do a physical examination and may perform various other tests including the following: blood tests to check for signs of infection or obstruction and/or to rule out other conditions. ultrasound : this procedure transmits high frequency sound waves through the body. the echoes are recorded and transformed into images of various parts of the body. an ultrasound can be used to identify gallstones. cat scan : this test uses specialized x-rays to create cross-section images of organs and body tissues. cholescintigraphy (hida scan) : this test can determine whether the gallbladder is contracting correctly. a radioactive material is injected into the patient and makes its way to the gallbladder. the technician can then observe the movement of the gallbladder. endoscopic ultrasound : this test combines ultrasound and endoscopy to look for gallstones. endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography : the doctor inserts an endoscope through the patient's mouth down to the small intestine and injects a dye to allow the bile ducts to be seen. the doctor can then remove gallstones that have moved into the ducts.	how are gallstones diagnosed?

the vaginal and urethral areas are rich in blood supply just like the inside of your nose. it doesn't take much irritation to make these mucosal areas bleed but it would be nice if you (or your medical provider) can find the source. sometimes the tiniest of little tears can bleed. some urinary tract infections will present initially as bleeding so having a urinalysis would be good to make sure you do not have an infection.	i recently noticed that after i pee when i wipe there is some blood. but there isn't any blood in my underwear. i noticed this on sunday. there was a lot of blood but i finished my period a few days before hand. i don't know what's wrong this has never happened to me before. i can only see blood when i wipe. . i am not on my period.
you bring up two important issues regarding the treatment of adhd with medications. first the difficulty finding the right combination of medications when co-existing conditions are present and second the use of adhd medications during pregnancy. when choosing a medication to address adhd symptoms it is extremely important to keep co-existing conditions in mind and not make them worse with treatment. some co-existing conditions such as mild depression/demoralization or anxiety may be the result of untreated adhd and will improve once the adhd is treated. however some stimulants may make anxiety (or depression) worse particularly those in the amphetamine class so its best to avoid those if you can if you have anxiety. in addition other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) have been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety in persons with adhd. this treatment can be a particularly useful adjunct for those with anxiety/self-esteem issues or who can not take medications for whatever reason. that brings us to the second issue pregnancy and medications used to treat adhd. basically the stimulants are not recommended for use during pregnancy in order to avoid any possibility of damage to the developing fetus. there have been no studies done in humans but cardiac defects have been seen in animals given very high doses of stimulants during pregnancy. if you are contemplating getting pregnant it is best to discuss this with your prescribing physician and ob/gyn and wean off any stimulant treatment.	i'm a 29-year-old female with adhd depression and anxiety and can't find the right medication/treatment plan for me. al. i'm a 29-year-old female with adhd depression and anxiety and can't find the right medication/treatment plan for me. also willl my adhd be affected by my planned ivf?

follow-up exams are important after treatment for colon cancer. the cancer can recur near the original site or in a distant organ such as the liver or lung. follow-up exams include a physical examination by the doctor blood tests of liver enzymes chest x-rays cat scans of the abdomen and pelvis colonoscopies and blood cea levels. abnormal liver enzymes may indicate growth of liver metastasis. cea levels may be elevated before surgery and become normal shortly after the cancer is removed. slowly rising cea level may indicate cancer recurrence. a cat scan of the abdomen and pelvis can show tumor recurrence in the liver pelvis or other areas. colonoscopy can show recurrence of polyps or cancer in the large intestine. in addition to checking for cancer recurrence patients who have had colon cancer may have an increased risk of cancer of the prostate breast and ovary. therefore follow-up examinations should include these areas.	what is the follow-up care for colon cancer?

it depends on how recently you had the piercing done. so if it's within the first week or so chances are the skin might grow back together although you will still have a scar at the site. if it's longer than that chances are you will always have at least a potential space there. however if there is an infection it does need to be evaluated by a doctor and treated and the piercing may need to be removed until the infection has cleared at least.	i got my bellybutton pierced but i think it’s infected. if i take the piercing out will the skin grow back together?

during pregnancy it's important for a woman to get enough calcium for herself as well as her growing baby. most studies show that while some bone loss may occur during pregnancy a woman usually regains it after giving birth. in fact studies show that having children even as many as 10 does not increase a woman's chance of getting osteoporosis later in life. for women who have pregnancies in their teens the effects on bone health later in life are still not certain. teens have not yet reached peak bone mass. more studies are needed to learn if teen pregnancies can affect future bone health. some women develop a temporary type of osteoporosis during pregnancy. while we do not fully understand what causes this type of osteoporosis it is extremely rare and usually goes away shortly after a woman gives birth. breastfeeding for the recommended 6-12 months has many health benefits for mother and baby. like pregnancy breastfeeding may cause some temporary bone loss. however bone density appears to recover over time and should not cause long-term harm to a woman's bone health.	what happens to your bones during pregnancy and breastfeeding?

that would be a reasonable course of action. sinusitis can be a bit tricky to treat and often one course of antibiotics may not do it. in light of the fact that you are still having facial pain (and pressure? ) and are still congested and coughing you may need further care -- perhaps a stronger or different antibiotic (assuming you had an antibiotic the first round) and something more to control your symptoms. you should go back to your doctor because there are quite a number of reasons why your symptoms may have not be alleviated such as the cause of your sinus infection may have not been bacterial rather viral therefore antibiotics were futile to the infection and so on.	i was just treated for a sinus infection but still feel bad- do i head back to the doc? . i finished all the medication as prescribed but am still congested coughing and have face pain
"most humans get colds during the colder weather because people are inside more and viruses are more active and prevalent at that time. this is common for everyone not just you. the cold air temperature does not cause illnesses. there is no such thing as being ""allergic to cold weather"". one can get a runny nose or even a reactive cough from changes in air temperature or humidity but this is not an allergy or an illness. just a normal bodily response. she could be more sensitive to those things but it is definitely not an allergy to cold weather. this person could have allergies to something in her sleeping environment like dust dust mites feather pillows detergents etc. which could make symptoms appear worse at night but she would need to be allergy-tested to make that determination."

my advice is just the opposite – your children should be vaccinated for seasonal and h1h1 flu. the problem with the h1n1 virus is that it is affecting healthy young adults and children. we have especially seen a number of h1n1-related deaths in children if they have asthma. that alone should tell you that this is a very serious virus and if you have access to the vaccine you and your children should get it. each year thousands of children and adults (over 35 000) die just from seasonal flu. in my mind it is better to be safe than sorry.	do my 3- and 5-year-old children really need to get the flu/h1n1 vaccines? my chiropractor strongly suggests against it.

with the conversation i understand that you are a 33 year old male suffering from cough especially during the months of september and october through the years. therefore it is clear that you are suffering from allergic bronchitis. it is considered to be seasonal. this cough exacerbates in specific months like september and october in your case. during such exacerbation it is advisable to take a steroid bronchodilator and an antibiotic. in your case decadron (dexamethasone) is the steroid proair hfa aerosol (albuterol) is the bronchodilator and zithromax z-pak (azithromycin) is the antibiotic. accordingly antibiotic should be prescribed only if infection is present and if there is yellow or green colored sputum production fever and chest congestion. bronchodilator in the form of aerosol spray helps to relieve bronchospasm and to get rid of any inflammation associated with it. i would suggest you to continue with the aerosol spray as prescribed by your doctor. check for few days. if the symptoms of cough recur then start the antibiotics. when the allergic bronchitis exacerbates you can use proair inhaler and seroflo inhaler (combination of fluticasone and salmeterol) or budecort (budesonide) inhaler together. the two inhalers have a specific way of usage. you can check it with your physician. for further information consult an allergy specialist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,For the past three years, I have been suffering from allergic cough.

"this caught my eye because i want to make people aware of why we do not give ""penicillin shots"" or antibiotics for colds. first antibiotics do not do anything for the common cold. antibiotics are only helpful if you have an infection that is caused by bacteria. there has been a lot of antibiotic ""misuse"" in the u. s. (people not taking antibiotics correctly over-prescribed saving them for a ""rainy day"") and that has caused a lot of problems including the fact that good old stand-by medications like penicillin are not working anymore because the bugs have become ""resistant. "" we are getting ""superbugs"" that our current antibiotics cannot touch -- and this is a dangerous and important health crisis. to avoid your problem in the future i would suggest proper symptom management and talking to your pharmacist about what products may be beneficial for you. this may include using nasal decongestants or saline irrigation systems to help cleanse your sinus cavity and avoid the possibilities of infection."	i keep getting sinus drainage that leads to a full-blown cold. why can’t i get a shot of penicillin anymore?

"i don't know. not all exposures to infectious disease will result in the disease. if your partner had oral chlamydia and it was not successfully treated it is possible. i don't know what he used for his treatment if the dose was appropriate or if he actually took it (some people lie you know). my recommendation for partners is to have ""proof of cure"" before having sexual contact again. that means that both people have to test negative after treatment. most chlamydia transfer is through sexual intercourse. if you do start having signs of chlamydia again you may need to be retested. at least one of you had to have sex with someone else in the immediate past -- the chlamydia came from somewhere -- so a firm pledge of monogamy is important in a relationship along with the use of condoms for added security and protection."	can i get clamydia from only receiving oral sex from an infected partner? . i was already cleared up with my clamydia my partner just took his meds the day before he gave me oral. did i catch it? . .

"a sinus infection occurs when a pathogenic organism (virus bacterium or a fungus) grows within a sinus and causes intermittent blockage of the sinus ostium. drainage of mucus and pus often occur when the blockage is relieved. the drainage usually goes from the nasal passages to the throat or out the nostrils. such infections also cause inflammation (an influx of immune cells and swelling of the sinus tissue) of one or more sinuses. this adds to blocking the openings of the sinuses and causes discomfort. inflammation of the air cavities within the passages of the nose (paranasal sinuses) is referred to as sinusitis. sinusitis can be caused by infection but can also be caused by allergy and irritation of the sinuses. sinusitis is one of the more common conditions that can afflict people throughout their lives. sinusitis commonly occurs when environmental pollens irritate the nasal passages such as with hay fever. sinusitis can also result from irritants such as chemicals or the use and/or abuse of over-the-counter (otc) nasal sprays and illegal substances that may be snorted through the nose. about 30 million adults have ""sinusitis.

a diet to help control diabetes is often individually prescribed -- based on body weight and lifestyle -- to help keep blood sugar levels in control. the best snacks for diabetics will contain some protein and some fiber to help slow down food absorption and therefore help control blood sugar levels and prevent spiking. avoid simple sugars such as in cookies and candies and choose whole grain crackers low-fat cheeses maybe a slice of turkey or leftover chicken. and pair these foods with a small amount of fruit if desired. know that fruit while healthy can be high in natural sugars that will spike blood sugar levels unless combined with a protein source to slow down their absorption in your body.	what kind of snacks would you recommend for people who are diabetic?
well . in 2014 two very important rules change. the most important is that insurance companies will be forbidden by law from denying coverage to americans with pre-existing health conditions. right now insurance companies can lock people out of the market or price people out of the market. that will no longer be allowed come 2014. people will with a pre-existing health condition be able to buy coverage be able to participate in a pool. in order to make sure that that happens and that we have a solvent insurance pool there is an additional feature that says everyone needs to participate. so most people right now have access to employer-based coverage or indeed carry their own coverage or they qualify for a public program. a limited number of people are not in those categories at all and most of those folks don't have the finances to buy insurance coverage on their own so starting in 2014 there will be a personal responsibility provision that says everybody needs to participate. if you are in the exchange and need some financial assistance based on your income that will be available. if you have employer coverage you're covered. if you are purchasing insurance on your own you'll have an opportunity to purchase that coverage in the insurance exchange. if you qualify for public programs you're covered. so we think that the vast majority of people and this has been the case in massachusetts where they have an exchange set up with very similar rules the vast majority of people who don't have insurance really would love to have coverage for themselves and their families they just can't afford it. and those days will be over. if indeed somebody can afford coverage when we get to 2014 and refuses to pay for coverage there is a financial penalty and it's really paying for the health service that that person and their family may well access. what we know is if someone has an automobile accident and is taken to a hospital they're going to get health care. if they have a stroke or if a family member has cancer they will have health care. they just will be shifting those costs onto everyone else onto taxpayers and hospitals and everyone who buys coverage. so there is an employer responsibility piece there is a government responsibility piece and there's an individual responsibility component of the new health care law.	how much will i be fined if i don't get insurance?

tunnel vision is a medical condition that results in a loss of peripheral vision. as a result the patient can only see objects from within a circular field. this condition has many possible causes including problems in the brain some eye diseases hallucinogenic drugs and certain extreme activities. blood loss to parts of the brain can lead to tunnel vision as can a tumor pressing against the optic never fibers. a person who is exposed to air that has been contaminated by oils and hydraulic fluids such as may happen in an airplane and during hard exercise may also develop this condition. becoming ill while in an aircraft can cause temporary vision problems. the pressure placed on the optic nerve causes the eye to lose retinal ganglion cells which can eventually cause the patient to go blind. for some patients a loss of peripheral vision may be experienced prior to blindness.	after hard phys exercise sometimes get bad tunnel vision and a big ball of light right where i try to focus my eyes. why? . i've got a heart murmour and my mum dad and all 4 grand parents had diabetes. not a good start! drama is that after particularly cheeky physical exercise i sometimes get really bad tunnel vision and what seems like a big ball of light right where i'm trying to focus feel dizzy and like i've got pins and needles in both hands. lasts for about 2 hours then goes back to normal. asked the med centre on camp and they have no idea.
the only way you are going to find a definitive answer as to the nature of this skin lesion. and get an effective treatment is to physically see a medical professional either your primary care medical provider or a dermatologist. it is not possible for me or any medical professional to make this important call blindly over the internet without the privilege of seeing this area first-hand and having a more detailed medical history. if this condition has been going on for years i think it is time that you see a medical professional so you can be properly diagnosed and treated.

yes it could be fungal. depending of what direction you have more confidence in get candida treatment like fluconazole and if you are circumsized use the creams like canesten. if you are not circumsized i would not recommend the creams as they shrink the foreskin and you will feel like a little boy again.

i have gone through your query and can understand your health concern. the allergic reaction can be due to amoxicillin only because acetaminophen and codeine will not cause any allergic reaction. i suggest you to stop amoxicillin. you can use any of the cephalosporin instead of amoxicillin. for allergic reaction i suggest some antihistamine drug twice daily for three days. amoxicillin and other drugs of this group are very common to cause allergic reactions. as you have mentioned that you never developed such reaction in the past and this is the first time i tell you that it can happen. i suggest you not to take amoxicillin in the future. for further information consult an allergy specialist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,Yesterday, I had my wisdom tooth extracted. I received a prescription for Tylenol 3 (equivalent to Acetaminophen 300 mg and Codeine 30 mg) for pain and Amoxicillin (500 mg) to prevent infection. I immediately took one Amoxicillin as I walked out of the dental office and for the rest of the day I had no reaction. Later just before going to sleep I took one Amoxicillin along with one Tylenol 3. The next day I woke up with an anaphylactic reaction to the groin and inner thighs. I am trying to diagnose whether it was due to Tylenol 3, the Amoxicillin or may be due to the combination. As there was not that much pain I have decided to halt the use of Tylenol 3 and I am waiting to see if the reaction resolves. However, I do know that many people are allergic to this family of antibiotics. I am wondering if this may be the case for me as well, but I have never had an allergic reaction before. I am sure that I have taken this family of antibiotics previously, though I am not certain.
i suppose it's possible. middle ear infections can be very painful and i'm sure it might feel as if the pain is radiating down the neck to the shoulder. however the pain you're describing could be caused by many other conditions including muscle strain degenerative disc disease or even possibly mastoiditis. the only way to tell what's causing your pain is for you to get an examination by a medical professional. if your pain doesn't clear up or if it's accompanied by a fever i'd suggest you contact your primary health care provider for an appointment to find out what's going on. hope this helps! shoulder pain problems shoulder pain problems	can ear infection cause neck and shoulder pain

under the law there is financial assistance to help make the cost of coverage more affordable. people with very low incomes in states that expanded their medicaid programs may qualify for low or no cost coverage through that program. people with incomes below about $46 000 per year qualify for tax credits to lower the cost of insurance premiums. the lower your income the more help you'll get. in addition if you earn less than roughly $29 000 you may qualify for reduced cost-sharing. that means you'll pay less when you go for medical care. you should log onto healthcare. gov right away. you'll be able to plug in your income information and learn if you qualify for financial assistance. open enrollment closes this sunday february 15th so you need to act now to get health insurance for 2015. once open enrollment closes you won't have a chance to buy insurance for the remainder of the year.	what if i dont qualify for medicade but also have low income

well i'm not going to sugarcoat it. a cystoscopy isn't the most pleasant experience you'll ever have. on the other hand it's not as painful as say a big incision in your abdomen. based on feedback from male friends who have had a cystoscopy i can tell you they describe the discomfort of the procedure as: pinching and pressure. they say it's not so bad they felt they would have preferred sedation especially since the procedure only takes a few minutes. according to my friends the discomfort lasts about an hour or so but there's no pain or burning on urination afterwards. for the urodynamic test you probably will have a urinary (foley) catheter placed and then your bladder will be filled with fluid. in my experience as a nurse many men have told me the sensation of having a catheter placed was quite uncomfortable. those who could relax and focus their attention elsewhere seemed to tolerate the procedure better. and that is my advice to you. as much as possible focus your attention on your breathing. take long slow deep breaths. focus on making your navel (belly button) rise and fall. it may sound wackadoodle but this relaxation technique really does work. also try to hold a mental image in your mind of you walking out of the clinic getting into your car and driving home. this will help remind you the discomfort is only temporary and soon will be over with. i know you'll breeze through these procedures just fine. wishing you well!	have cystocope and urodynamic test tomorrow what should i expect as far as pain? am pretty scared! . have pretty sever bph and am a male age 53 what can i expect?

"wart treatments require patience. how well wart treatments work is another matter. warts can appear and disappear without an identifiable cause and may disappear on their own without treatment. some warts sprout offshoots near the main wart and others don't. some hurt and others are painless. certain warts even of the same type respond to treatment while others (even on the same person at the same time) don't. all treatment methods often require many sessions over weeks months or longer to succeed. here is a practical approach to the treatment of warts: 1. if you can ignore your warts do so. eventually they'll go away (although eventually can mean a long time -- even months or years). 2. if you have an easy case (a single wart on the face or one or a few on the hands) see a doctor for a quick freeze or electrical zap. this method is simple almost painless and non-scarring. 3. if you have a hard case you can start by treating the warts for a few weeks on your own. examples: plantar warts: warts on the bottom of the foot feel deep but they are still within the superficial layer of the skin. salicylic-acid drops and plasters help remove the thick overlying callus and make the wart feel less like a marble in your shoe. nonprescription aerosol freezing may be used as well. common hand warts: these are typically unattractive although not painful. salicylic acid can make them smaller and go away in some cases as can nonprescription freezing. if you have an all-but-impossible case don't try too hard. you don't want to make the treatment worse than the disease. examples: warts under the nails: these are extremely resistant to treatment. one or two tries by the doctor are worth a shot but if they fail putting acid on them yourself just makes them look rough and unattractive. ""mosaic"" warts: tiny so-called seed warts can proliferate by the dozens or hundreds all over the sole of the foot. they don't usually hurt and they rarely respond to any sort of treatment although in this case too one or two tries at treatment may be in order. flat warts: these are small flat flesh-colored pimples and may be numerous on one part of the body (for example on the face arms or groin). getting rid of them by a light application of salicylic acid or other method is easy enough but they have a tendency to recur."	are wart treatments effective?

the keys to avoiding the condition depend on the type of hepatitis. many types of hepatitis can be prevented by making informed lifestyle choices. vaccinations are available for hepatitis a and b. adequate sanitation and clean personal habits will help reduce the spread of hepatitis a and hepatitis e. in areas where sanitation is questionable boil water. cook all food well and peel all fruit. health care workers or caregivers involved in the treatment of patients with contagious forms of hepatitis should wash their hands utensils bedding and clothing with soap and hot water. people planning to travel to countries where hepatitis is widespread are advised to have immune serum globulin shots or vaccinations before leaving. immune serum globulin may prevent infection from some types of hepatitis after exposure if administered within a certain timeframe. to prevent the spread of hepatitis b avoid exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. do not have intimate contact or share razors scissors nail files toothbrushes or needles with anyone who has the disease. if you suspect that you have been exposed to either hepatitis a or b you should receive immune serum globulin and vaccinations for the viruses as soon as possible. in the u. s. all children are advised to receive a hepatitis b vaccine before starting school. the hepatitis a vaccine is also recommended for children in areas with high prevalence of disease.	how can i prevent getting hepatitis?

infertility can be treated with medicine surgery artificial insemination or assisted reproductive technology. many times these treatments are combined. about two-thirds of couples who are treated for infertility are able to have a baby. in most cases infertility is treated with drugs or surgery. doctors often treat infertility in men in the following ways: sexual problems: if the man is impotent or has problems with premature ejaculation doctors can help him address these issues. too few sperm: if the man produces too few sperm surgery sometimes can correct this problem. in other cases doctors can surgically remove sperm from the male reproductive tract. antibiotics can also be used to clear up infections affecting sperm count. various fertility drugs are often used to treat women with ovulation problems. it is important to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of these medicines. doctors also use surgery to treat some causes of infertility. problems with a woman's ovaries fallopian tubes or uterus can sometimes be corrected with surgery. intrauterine insemination (iui) is another type of treatment for infertility. iui is known by most people as artificial insemination.	how do doctors treat infertility?
for couples struggling with infertility it's a particularly cruel fact: not only can infertility cause a lot of stress but stress can affect fertility. it's known to contribute to problems with ovulation. for many people the longer you go without conceiving the more stress you feel. fears about infertility may also lead to tension with your partner and that can reduce your chances of pregnancy even further. after all it's hard to have sex if one of you sleeps on the couch. while it's a fact that coping with infertility is stressful that doesn't mean you have to give into it. if your doctor can't find a medical cause for your ovulation problems consider finding support groups or a therapist who can help you learn better ways to cope with the anxieties that come with infertility. the american society of reproductive medicine offers these tips for reducing stress: keep the lines of communication open with your partner. get emotional support. a couples' counselor support groups or books can help you cope. try out some stress-reduction techniques such as meditation or yoga. cut down on caffeine and other stimulants. exercise regularly to release your physical and emotional tension. agree on a medical treatment plan including financial limits with your partner. learn as much as you can about the cause of your infertility and your treatment options.	how does stress affect fertility?

there are strong arguments to be made both in favor and against using artificial sweeteners in my opinion. one thing that is easy to agree upon is that there we could benefit from stronger scientific data on the long-term effects of artificial sweeteners on the body. the lack of strong data helps fuel the debate in my view. the argument in favor of artificial sweeteners goes something like this: excess sugar is unhealthy. when added to foods and beverages it encourages overeating and has negative health effects that help fuel diabetes heart disease and associated risk factors even in the absence of obesity. for example drinking one can per day of regular soda is associated with nearly a doubling of the risk of type 2 diabetes. since we are going to be eating sweet foods it makes sense to find healthier ways to sweeten food if possible. saccharin (sweet-n-low sugar twin) aspartame (nutrasweet equal) acesulfame k (sweet one sunett swiss sweet) neotame and sucralose (splenda) are currently approved by the fda for this use. extensive testing has demonstrated no evidence of toxicity or negative short-term health effects. years of experience with these products has not demonstrated any clear signs of trouble. moreover the availability of the “diet” version of sodas and other artificially sweetened foods helps people avoid the higher sugar alternatives and to maintain caloric reductions and weight loss. in patients with diabetes the availability of artificial sweeteners can help control blood sugar when used to reduce sugar intake. artificial sweeteners have been blamed by various individuals for many types of medical symptoms (such as headaches) but scientific studies attempting to find an association with any symptom typically fail to confirm any relationship with artificial sweeteners. even if a small minority of individuals are truly sensitive to certain artificial sweeteners that would not necessarily be a good reason to discourage others from using them. furthermore some would argue that even if artificial sweeteners have minor health risks that would not necessarily offset their potential benefits. the argument against artificial sweeteners goes something like this: as a general principle humans and other animal species are genetically designed to eat foods that occur in nature and artificial sweeteners do not fit this criterion. obviously not everything that is natural is healthy but one should assume that chemicals that do not occur naturally are not fit for human consumption. anyone who argues otherwise should be required to prove that a specific artificial chemical is safe for long-term consumption and the scientific methods available at this time are not sufficient to be confident that such artificial substances are truly safe. a small but growing body of scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that non-caloric sweeteners stimulate food intake obesity diabetes and related diseases. as summarized on the harvard school of public health website the concern is that sweetness in the absence of calories is unnatural and may stimulate hormonal changes that encourage overeating. non-conclusive studies suggest that people who drink diet soft drinks are at increased future risk of obesity and are more likely to have type 2 diabetes than people who avoid diet (and sugar-sweetened) beverages. for these reasons and others some specialty grocery chains such as whole foods do not carry any foods with artificial sweeteners or other artificial ingredients. their position may reflect a popular philosophy that that sugar derived from natural sources is the lesser evil compared to artificial sweeteners. natural sweeteners such as stevia and erythritol and other sugar alcohols are typically welcomed by those who are concerned about both sugar and artificial sweeteners. however they do not provide a perfect solution either due to taste limitations and they may raise the same concerns about sweetness in the absence of calories discussed above. finding an elusive middle ground: so what is the most prudent approach to sweeten foods and beverages? it is impossible to build a consensus around this topic. all approaches have limitations and concerns. sugar tastes the best but is clearly unhealthy when used to excess. stevia and sugar alcohols seem the least risky but have taste limitations. artificial sweeteners may represent a middle ground depending on the degree to which one believes they are safe versus risky and data are inconclusive and sparse.	what are the pros and cons of artificial sweeteners?

ivf is the most common type of art and there are other variations on the basic procedure some of which remain controversial. people should learn about both the benefits and risks of any medical procedure. intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi): a single sperm is injected into an egg. if the egg is fertilized and develops normally it is then transferred to the uterus. this has been a significant advance in treating men with low sperm count or disorders related to sperm movement. couples who undergo the procedure should be aware that if their infertility is caused by a genetic defect that defect could be passed to the child. pre-implantation genetic diagnosis: an individual cell from a growing embryo is removed and used for genetic screening during ivf. blastocystculture: a blastocyst a developed embryo is cultured and transferred to the uterus after five or six days compared with the three days for typical in vitro fertilization. cryopreservation: human eggs and embryos are frozen so that they can be kept viable. they are stored in liquid nitrogen at 320 degrees below zero. assisted hatching: an opening is created in the egg shell surrounding the embryo to help it implant in the uterus. this procedure has not been shown to be beneficial for everyone undergoing art. those who may benefit from assisted hatching include couples who have preserved embryos their own or donated by cryopreservation couples in which the mother is of an advanced age or couples with a history of multiple failed ivf attempts. the fda does not regulate individual art procedures but the agency has cleared devices for use in art procedures. examples are biopsy devices dissection needles sperm and embryo delivery catheters and solutions used to process and maintain sperm eggs and embryos.	what other assisted reproductive technologies (art) are used to treat infertility?
chlamydia can be detected on material collected by swabbing the cervix during a traditional examination using a speculum but noninvasive screening tests done on urine or on self-collected vaginal swabs are less expensive and sometimes more acceptable to patients. while culturing of the organism can confirm the diagnosis this method is limited to research laboratories and forensic investigations. for routine diagnostic use newer and inexpensive diagnostic tests that depend upon identification and amplification of the genetic material of the organism have replaced the older time-consuming culture methods.	how is chlamydia diagnosed?
a medically induced coma is when a patient receives a controlled dose of an anesthetic typically propofol pentobarbital or thiopental to cause a temporary coma or a deep state of unconsciousness. this type of coma is used to protect the brain from swelling by reducing the metabolic rate of brain tissue as well as the cerebral blood flow. throughout a medically induced coma a patient’s critical life functions are constantly monitored by an anesthesiologist or other physician in a critical care setting only.	why would a doctor induce a coma in a stage four lung cancer patient. my sister in law was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer while being treated for breast cancer went to the hospital with respitory problems and was put on oxygen although it seemed she was getting better the doctors then informed the family she needed to be put into an induced coma and injected with some medicine after putting her into the coma the next day she was given the medicine in which immediatetly put her into cardiac arrest and she died. all this happened within a 3 week time frame
most helpful answer yes and yes. children can get hpv sometimes through birth and this can result in hpv in a child's throat or larynx for example (laryngeal papillomatosis). untreated this can lead to cancer. teenagers who are sexually involved or children who are sexually-molested can definitely get hpv and this can lead to cancer later in life. it would be highly highly unlikely to get hpv after sharing a bathtub or just using a used towel or other dirty laundry. while viruses can remain on some objects for hours. perhaps longer on wet objects. it really requires more of an intimate contact for an extended period of time to a susceptible person for transmission. some forms of hpv do not lead to cancer. only certain strains. the common wart is an hpv virus. the hpv vaccine for the more dangerous cancer-causing strains is very important and can be given as early as age ten.	can children get hpv and if so could it cause cancer? . i have a 2 strains of hpv one low risk and one high risk. i'm scared my 1 year old could get it before she gets vaccinated from sharing the same bathtub and toilet or her accidentally using my towel one day climbing in my bed where i have had sex with my husband who's probably infected too touching our dirty laundry. i'm not sure how long the virus stays alive for on hands clothes or objects and if she could contract hpv when i change her nappy bathe her or when she touches her private parts.
"most helpful answer you ask a great question and i'm going to try to give you a great answer. if only it were that simple! first i think we should acknowledge your current girlfriend for informing you about her hpv diagnosis. that is a very responsible and brave thing to do. she is behaving the way every adult should act in this situation. as to your risk for developing hpv if you have sexual contact with your girlfriend well it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. human papillomavirus (hpv) can exist in the skin without manifesting as warts. this means you can't always tell visually whether or not a person has hpv and you can contract the virus through skin-to-skin contact even in the absence of warts. also a condom often does not protect against this contact because the hpv-infected area of a woman's vulva may contact the portion of your penis or scrotum not covered by the condom. all of that said hpv also can clear up on its own. one study showed around 90 percent of female study participants showed no trace of the virus about two years after their initial diagnosis. this means it's possible your girlfriend's body has cleared the virus on its own. on the other hand the hpv virus can go dormant for years. maybe your girlfriend's case is dormant not cleared. to your question about ""is your risk of getting hpv higher with this woman than with the general population "" the answer is yes if she is currently infected and no if she has cleared the virus. keep in mind if you contract hpv from this girlfriend you risk transmitting the virus to another girlfriend down the road (even if you use a condom). as i'm sure you know certain strains of hpv cause cervical cancer. you should consider whether or not you want to be even remotely responsible for spreading this potentially life-threatening virus. clear as mud? wishing you well!"	a girl i have been dating told me she has hpv. are my risks any greater with her than the general population? . we have not had sex. i guess she had some warts and they have gone away without recurrence for at least 5 or so years. . she is telling me it is no big deal. given the stats i wonder if my risks any greater with her than the general population. . i am in the process of divorcing and i logically know this will not be a lifelong thing with the new girl.
hi. u have taken overdose of synergistic medicines. you should seek medical help immediately	Question: I just overdosed
this is actually a side-effect of the medication working and drowsiness will actually continue as long as you are taking the medicine it will not subside. so i would advise the patient to let the physician know if it becomes really bothersome they feel that they can't go to work. there is actually a lower shrunk of this medication that is available. so the physician or healthcare provider may want to consider decreasing the dose and basically seeing if that helps the patient better with the drowsiness side-effect. but once again if the patient comes into the pharmacy and says to me you know i feel like i am really tired of this medication and i have to take it a lot of time four-times-a-day is really complicated for a medication. i might be able to say you know let's call your doctor and let's see if we can get them down to a lower dose and if the doctor approves it then we can try that instead. but coming to the pharmacy asking us that's what we are here for. we are the medication experts.	my doctor has put me on dicyclomine 20 mg four-times-a-day for two weeks. it makes me sleepy. will i get used to this?

not that your experience is normal but it is more common than you think. the first thing to do is check any new clothing detergent or soap that you use. these products can cause allergic-type reactions in some people. if you rule out detergent soap or any other lotions then you should consider a possible allergic reaction during exercise due to the release of histamines. it's not that you are allergic to exercise but rather that you may be experiencing a biological response during or after you work out that mimics an allergic reaction. here's what could be happening and why. during exercise histamines are released. histamines are proteins involved in autoimmune responses like an allergic reaction to pollen or dust. people who are sensitive to histamines can experience rashes itching and other allergic symptoms during exercise just like you are describing. most of the time the rashes appear on the chest and thighs but they can appear on the neck or arms too. sometimes exercise also reacts with food allergies or medications (for example antibiotics pain medications sedatives tranquilizers and diuretics) to cause the problem. the problem typically occurs more in cold weather than warm. if the problem bothers you so much that you can't stand it or it's not resolving on its own then you should ask your doctor about using a topical ointment to stop the itching or taking an over-the-counter antihistamine like benadryl 30-60 minutes before exercising. if over-the-counter antihistamines make you sleepy your doctor can prescribe a non-sedating antihistamine. you should not take over-the-counter or prescription medications for this problem without speaking with your doctor.	is it normal to break out in a very itchy rash all over my arms legs and abdomen after i work out?

so if your partner’s body odor is keeping you awake there’s a few things you want to do. number one is look at their diet. body odor is very consistent with what it is you are eating. if you’ve ever heard of people sweating garlic you know what that means is that people who have high garlic content you can actually smell it in their body odor. oftentimes i have people shower before bed and change their clothes before bed. having a specific night wear specifically some type of pajamas is what you’re looking for. oftentimes if you’re going to have somebody who wears the same pajamas over and over actually a polyester is going to be better than cotton because cotton will absorb all of that odor when and the sweat whereas the poly-blend probably won’t.	what can i do if my partner’s body odor is keeping me awake?

the primary cause of toxic shock syndrome is a toxin produced by the bacterium staphylococcus aureus. two conditions are necessary: the bacteria need an environment in which they can grow rapidly and release toxins (such as a tampon saturated with blood menstrual sponge diaphragm or cervical cap that has been left in the vagina for a very long time). then the toxins must have a way of getting into the bloodstream. sliding a tampon into place in the vagina may make microscopic tears in its walls rupturing tiny blood vessels. a superabsorbent tampon -- especially if it's left in place too long or if it is used when the menstrual flow is light -- can dry out the vagina making such tearing even more likely.	what causes toxic shock syndrome?

to start i highly suggest you get online at healthcare. gov to search for an insurance policy. open enrollment is now underway and only lasts until february 15th. if you haven't looked for insurance yet don't automatically assume it will be too costly. the law provides fairly generous subsidies for people with low and mid-level incomes and depending on where you live and your income you may even qualify for free or very low-cost coverage. be sure when you shop to carefully review the list of services and medications the plans cover and how much of the cost you'll be expected to pay. otherwise you might check with an organization such as needymeds. org to get help covering the cost of medicine. good luck.	i have been taking maxide 25mg for the past 7 years. i dont have insurance anymore and my meds ran out what happens now?

hi what is below is from webmd may help calm you down as what you may have had was just some warts ordanair but see what you think. hpv and childbirth the risk of hpv transmission to the baby during childbirth is very low. even if babies do get the hpv virus their bodies usually clear the virus on their own. most of the time a baby born to a woman with genital warts does not have hpv-related complications. in very rare cases a baby born to a woman who has genital warts will develop warts in the throat. this serious condition is called respiratory papillomatosis and requires frequent laser surgery to prevent the warts from blocking the baby's breathing passages. and even if the mother has a type of hpv virus that has caused cervical cancer the baby can be delivered safely. do hope this helps you. good luck	hpv before sexually active? . i know that hpv can be spread from your mother during birth but my question is did that happen to me? so basically since i was really young i had a wart on my right thigh and as i got a bit older they started to grow on my right arm. my mother told me it was from resting my elbow and arm on my thigh and that contact spread them. but i also had one on my finger and down there. on my outer labia. but one year they all vanished randomly. could that have been hpv?

"the short answer to your question is: no. currently there is no cure for tinnitus unless it's caused by a curable underlying condition (such as taking too much aspirin). tinnitus (or ""ringing in the ears"") can be more than annoying. it can become a debilitating problem in which the ""noise in the ears"" can drown out other sounds including a loved one's talking. if you believe you have tinnitus start with a visit to your primary care provider for an evaluation. you may be referred to a hearing specialist. while medication are available to treat tinnitus many people rely on masking devices that sort of ""counteract"" the interior noise of tinnitus. there's also a new hearing aid available that both amplifies sound and masks the tinnitus noise. wishing you well!"	does lipo flavonoid reduce or cure tinnitus?

in most cases insurers that are doing this are offering people already insured with them the chance to sign up again for another year generally at a lower price. you can keep a non-aca compliant plan through 2014. but that option goes away in 2014 -- and it's not an option for consumers living in some states because the marketplaces have not allowed it. if you've been given the chance to buy or renew a non-aca plan for another year then i'm guessing you already know the difference in price -- likely the companies are offering a less expensive option with a plan non-compliant with the law. the plans also typically offer benefits that are not as rich. however this option for most people goes away.	i've heard aetna cigna et al. are still underwriting plans until dec. 31 2013. is this true?

most helpful answer based on the information in your posting it does not seem likely that this would be herpes let alone a genital herpes. the most likely cause would be a contact dermatitis (how in the world would you get poison ivy here anyway? ). it could be some residual chemicals in a laundry detergent soap dryer softeners or even the elastic band of your under-clothing. many things. instead of benadryl (which can cause some sensitivity reactions itself) a trial of hydrocortisone may be helpful. there is really no way to medical prove as specific cause if it is a contact dermatitis. herpes on the skin is painful. it is composed of groups of tiny water-filled blisters that rupture. the area surrounding these tiny blisters is red and irritated. it can itch but pain and tingling would be a more common symptom. there are certainly other considerations so i am pleased you are seeing a medical provider for a hands-on examination. hello i spent the last 3 months having herpes like symptoms and after a series of tests / doctors it was finally discovered that i had an e. coli infection on the skin around my genitals. it was very painful caused similar symptoms as herpes with tingling ulcers etc. but easily addressed with antibiotics. i would encourage your doctor to not only test for herpes but to swab for a bacterial or yeast infection as it may be something more benign than what you think it is. don't get too overwhelmed by what you read on the internet until you have something properly diagnosed. i know it can be months of agony but hang in there.	could it not be herpes? . i had a small itchy itchy itchy path about an 1-2 inch away from my bikini line on my inner thigh. i thought it was poison ivy so i put on benadryl cream and it seemed to stop the itching but the bumps raised and were somewhat sore but i don't know if that was due to friction they then scabbed and the itching started again. i havent had sex in 2. 5 months and have been with the same guy for over 3 years. i'm going to get a blood test next tuesday. . any advice?

i don’t think that there is quite enough research yet to justify the claim that red peppers can treat hypertension. the simple answer is that there never is one “super food” that should be emphasized more than any other to treat any health condition. i would suggest looking into the dash diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). the dash diet emphasizes fruits vegetables fat-free or low-fat dairy products whole grain products fish poultry and nuts. it’s also lower in red meat sugars and sodium. this diet has been shown to lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people. a healthy eating plan such as the dash diet along with a consistent cardiovascular exercise routine can be part of an effective treatment and management plan for hypertension. consult with your doctor further and please visit the following website for more information: <link>	is red pepper a good supplement to treat hypertension. i have read that a ingrediant in red pepper is very good at treating hypertension

"my best answer is: you should not discontinue simvastatin without consulting your physician. a stress test alone cannot tell you there is ""no build up"" of plaque in your arteries. i'm glad your stress test result was good but your total cholesterol number is a bit high. it's not outrageous though and that fact warrants a discussion with your physician. if your health care provider feels you need to be on a cholesterol-lowering drug there are many alternatives to simvastatin. your provider can advise you how to discontinue the simvastatin and start a new medication if needed. you might also check out webmd's heart disease community to see how others have handled their borderline high cholesterol issues what medications they take and how they talked to their doctor about their choices of cholesterol-lowering drugs. take care! i would ween myself off of the medicine and cut the pill in half and take half for a week. the next week i would take half of a half then take half of a half every other day for a week. the fourth week i would discontinue altogether. i would tell my doctor if or when i had a visit. i think w/this drug you could probably just stop taking it all together but of course i am not a doctor. it's not like a blood pressure medicine though. i had horrible side effects (ttp bruising platelets dramatically dropped muscles hurt brain fog tired) from this drug. i will never take a statin again. i believe there are other more natural things out there that will work. my cholestrol was 225 when i was put on it. good luck! i applaud your attitude to this dangerous drug. i would suggest you do a lot of research on the subject. dr. duane graveline's book 'lipitor thief of memory' is a good start: www. spacedoc. com there are a lot of links to other doctors surgeons and researchers who are skeptical of statins. i went through all the test in the hospital. i was told i had a heart of a 27 year old. my doctor did not believe the test as he could not control my blood pressure. they went in and found a blockage--widow maker. they did a stent. surgeon stated i would have been dead within 30 days. so much for test. you can try red yeast rice and naicin. naicin taken twice a day can lower according to my doctor. i take both and my readings are 90/72. try it capsules do not cost very much. these books i have found to be very resourceful. the statin damage crisis/ by duane graveline m. d. the great cholestrol myth by jonny bowden ph. c. n. s. and how statin drugs really lower cholesterol james b. yoseph and hannah yoseph md. i urge you to do your research carefully."	how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. .

there are some skills that you can develop to help you improve your ability to manage anger. just like with any other skill set it’s best to practice when you don’t have the pressure of needing to be doing it well in that moment. with this in mind consider the following abcd approach: activity: exercise regularly and then also do it when you feel your anger building. if you don’t already have an exercise routine explore different types of exercise to find the ones you most enjoy (e. g. jogging weight lifting pilates). breathing: deep (or diaphragmatic) breathing can be very helpful in calming down or reducing anxiety. you breathe slowly taking time to pause at the end of each inhale and exhale. with this kind of breathing your stomach will ‘inflate’ like a balloon when you inhale and ‘deflate’ when you exhale. meanwhile your chest will not expand. if this is difficult for you try lying on your back with your knees pulled up and your feet flat on the floor. it can also help to place a hand on your stomach to feel its rise on your inhale. calming activity: find a hobby or activity that you enjoy and can engage in with your full attention. examples are gardening yoga painting or playing music. deepening understanding — of yourself and the other person: it can be extremely helpful to be aware of what ‘pushes your buttons. ’ by fully understanding this you can step back and see it happening which also means that you will not be as caught up in it and can choose to respond differently. so for instance you might say to yourself “there i go again. every time someone even implies that i’m not doing a good job i get furious. ” it can also be helpful to understand the person triggering your anger. chances are that they think their actions are valid; so by understanding their perspective (even if you disagree) you might be able to lessen your own anger and even respond in a way that they can respond more positively to.	how can i manage my anger?

assuming you are female it is possible to have both of these stds without having any symptoms. in females chlamydia can be primarily vaginal but it can spread into your uterus/fallopian tubes where it can cause scarring to the point where you could end up with a tubal (ectopic) pregnancy or perhaps a pid (pelvic inflammatory disease). one of the reasons we routinely test sexually-active people for chlamydia is because the symptoms can be subtle. we often find many surprises in an adolescent clinic when we routinely screen. hsv-2 or herpes can be another stealth std. most of the time the initial outbreak of herpes is an event that most people will not forget but it is also not uncommon for people to have blood evidence of past exposure with no memory of every having it. not all outbreaks are horrible so a minor outbreak may have been misdiagnosed as simple soreness or itching. men with stds can also have variable symptoms. i find many young men with chlamydia who do not know they have it and many with an outbreak of herpes who think they just have a rash from an allergic reaction to soap or laundry detergent. this is precisely why routine screening is a good thing.	is it possible to be asymtomatic to multiple std's? . i was recently diagnosed with hsv-2 and clamydia during a semi-routine std screening. to this day i still have not seen an outbreak from the hsv-2 and never noticed any abnormalities associated with the clamydia. is it possible to be asymptomatic for both of these std's?

see your medical provider. yes xanax can help anxiety (your reaction to stress assuming this is what is causing your symptoms) but it will not help the underlying causes of stress. xanax is part of a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines and is prescribed for anxiety and panic disorders. you may have heard the terms ssri (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or gaba (gamma amino butyric acid) - xanax changes brain function by altering gaba production in the brain at the receptor sites which alters the person’s mood. when used appropriately xanax is very effective. studies have shown that long-term xanax use can lead to dependence and addiction. quitting xanax use cold turkey can be dangerous because the nature of the drugs slows gaba (gamma amino butyric acid) production and changes brain chemistry. suddenly stopping xanax use can be too much for the brain to adjust to can result in serious side effects including horrifying nightmares delusions seizures and death. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	will xanax help with my stress. i am so stressed out i feel sick cant sleep cold sweats my neck burns my face is hot and i dont know what to do.

yes. television stimulates brain areas that interfere with sleep; it also suppresses the release of melatonin a natural hormone important in day-night cycling. children and teens especially tend to use even-more stimulating gadgets near bedtime. video games include rapid graphic images. computers cell phones and ipads support thousands of interactive applications that connect kids socially without any particular “off time. ” children with cell- or web-connected devices in their bedrooms get not only the sleep-depriving effect of bright screens at bedtime but may also continue to play games and communicate with friends well after what parents might have thought was “lights out. ” there are significant social health and educational consequences facing kids who aren’t getting their needed 8-10 hours of sleep every night. underslept children do poorer in school often exhibiting “add-like” behavior. they have more trouble getting along with friends and family and are more likely to struggle with obesity and depression. many teens who feel sleepy consume huge servings of coffee to stay awake which can further disrupt their normal sleep rhythm and leave them even more sleep-deprived.	can too much computer or tv time at night adversely affect children’s health?
screening tests are those that are done at regular intervals to detect a disease such as prostate cancer at an early stage. if the result of a screening test is normal the disease is presumed not to be present. if a screening test is abnormal the disease is then suspected to be present and further tests usually are needed to confirm the suspicion (that is to make the diagnosis definitively). prostate cancer usually is suspected initially because of an abnormality of one or both of the two screening tests that are used to detect prostate cancer. these screening tests are a digital rectal examination and a blood test called the prostate specific antigen (psa). in the digital rectal examination the doctor feels (palpates) the prostate gland with his gloved index finger in the rectum to detect abnormalities of the gland. thus a lump irregularity or hardness felt on the surface of the gland is a finding that is suspicious for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a digital rectal examination in men age 40 and over. the psa test is a simple reproducible and relatively accurate blood test. it is used to detect a protein (the prostate specific antigen) that is released from the prostate gland into the blood. the psa level is usually higher than 4ng/ml in people with prostate cancer than in people without the cancer. situations of large prostate size infection and inflammation are other reasons why the psa may be elevated. the psa therefore is valuable as a screening test for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a psa in men age 40 and over. subsequent screening is recommended based on individual preference and assessment of risk for developing prostate cancer. for example patients with a high risk of developing prostate cancer due to a family history or a high initial psa should have more frequent evaluation (usually annually). although still considered controversial most urologists recommend regular screening for prostate cancer in men who are likely to live for more than 10 years. the american urological association (aua) issued their latest guidelines for prostate cancer in 2009. according to these men at the age of 40 should be offered a baseline psa test and a prostate exam (digital rectal exam or dre) to ascertain the risk of prostate cancer. subsequent screening and tests may be performed according to the findings on this initial evaluation and an individual's risk of getting the disease on the basis of other factors such as race ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer. as mentioned most urologists currently would advise some form of screening in men with a life expectancy greater than 10 years. most frequently it would be performed on an annual basis. although there is no definite cutoff age to stop prostate cancer screening most physicians would rarely screen men more than 75 years of age for this disease. results of the psa test under 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood are generally considered normal. there is a recent trend however to perform prostate biopsy in all patients with a psa more than 2. 5 ng/ml in order to detect prostate cancer at an earlier (and hopefully completely curable) stage. the american urological association guidelines (2009) do not define a definite cutoff point but advise that all the other risk factors for prostate cancer should be taken into account while making a decision on whether to proceed for a biopsy. one of the important factors that needs to be considered is the rate at which the psa value has increased over time on repeated measurements (psa velocity). results between 4 and 10 are considered borderline. these borderline values are interpreted in the context of the patient's age symptoms signs family history and changes in the psa levels over time. results higher than 10 are considered abnormal suggesting the possibility of prostate cancer. it has been shown that the higher the psa value the more likely the diagnosis of prostate cancer. moreover the level of psa tends to increase when the cancer has progressed from organ-confined prostate cancer to local spread to distant (metastatic) spread. very high values such as 30 or 40 and over are usually caused by prostate cancer.	what are the screening tests for prostate cancer?

treatments vary among urologists and are tailored to the type of prostatitis you have. correct diagnosis is crucial and treatments vary. it's important to make sure your symptoms are not caused by urethritis (inflammation of the urethra) or some other condition that may lead to permanent bladder or kidney damage. treatments can include: anti-inflammatory medicines along with warm sitz baths (sitting in two to three inches of warm water). this is the most conservative treatment for chronic prostatitis. antibiotic medicine for infectious prostatitis. these drugs are not effective treatments for noninfectious prostatitis. for acute infectious prostatitis patients usually need to take antibiotic medicine for 14 days. almost all acute infections can be cured with this treatment. for chronic infectious prostatitis antibiotic medicine is taken for a longer period of time usually four to 12 weeks. about 75% of all cases of chronic infectious prostatitis clear up with this treatment. for cases that don't taking antibiotics at a low dose for a long time may be recommended to relieve the symptoms. pain medications. muscle relaxants. surgical removal of the infected portions of the prostate. a doctor may advise this treatment for severe cases of chronic prostatitis or for men whose swollen prostate is blocking the flow of urine. supportive therapies for chronic prostatitis including stool softeners and prostate massage. other treatments for chronic noninfectious prostatitis include the use of the alpha blocker drugs such as hytrin and cardura. these drugs relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder to improve urine flow and decrease symptoms. other drugs that lower hormone levels such as proscar may help to shrink the prostate gland in some men. some people may benefit from avoiding spicy foods and caffeinated or acidic drinks. activities that aggravate the condition such as bicycling may need to be eliminated as well. many cases of abacterial (nonbacterial) prostatitis (also considered chronic pelvic pain syndrome) respond to a mix of treatments that include exercise myofascial trigger point release progressive relaxation and counseling. prostatitis is a treatable disease. even if the problem cannot be cured you can usually get relief from your symptoms by following the recommended treatment. be sure to follow the full course any prescription you are given even if you no longer have any symptoms. with infectious prostatitis for example the symptoms may disappear before the infection has completely cleared.	what is the treatment for prostatitis?

this is typically a problem called keratosis pilaris. this is a genetic problem that we see in people. it can just happen. sometimes you grow into it sometimes you grow out of it. but also i tend to see it in people who have either personal or family histories of asthma or allergies. it's not something that we can cure but we can help control it. using products like urea or lactic acid or exfoliants this can help smooth the skin and make it softer. so scratching and picking at it obviously will make it worse and will make it more red will make it likely to last longer. scrubs can help to some effect. retinoids have not been very effective for this but using products that are called keratolytics; something that will help the skin cells turn over more effectively can help it dramatically. for some people it's worse in the summer for some it's worse in the winter. you can sort of pick your season. if you are out in the summer and you have a short sleeve dress it's more important to try to treat it then and in the winter you can let it go if it doesn't bother you. but it's not a harmful condition it's more of a nuisance.	i get bumpy skin on the back of my arms. i have tried microdermabrasion scrubs but they don't wok. what can i do?

"in addition to the depth of the burn the total area of the burn is significant. burns are measured as a percentage of total body area affected. the ""rule of nines"" is often used though this measurement is adjusted for infants and children. this calculation is based upon the fact that the surface area of the following parts of an adult body each correspond to approximately 9% of total (and the total body area of 100% is achieved): head = 9%. chest (front) = 9%. abdomen (front) = 9%. upper/mid/low back and buttocks = 18%. each arm = 9%. each palm = 1%. groin = 1%. each leg = 18% total (front = 9% back = 9%). as an example if both legs (18% x 2 = 36%) the groin (1%) and the front chest and abdomen were burned this would involve 55% of the body. only second and third degree burn areas are added together to measure total body burn area. while first degree burns are painful the skin integrity is intact and it is able to do its job with fluid and temperature maintenance. if more than15%-20% of the body is involved in a burn significant fluid may be lost. shock may occur if inadequate fluid is not provided intravenously. as the percentage of burn surface area increases the risk of death increases as well. patients with burns involving less than 20% of their body should do well but those with burns involving greater than 50% have a significant mortality risk depending upon a variety of factors including underlying medical conditions and age."	what is the significance of the amount of body area burned?

catastrophic plans are plans under which an individual pays the vast majority of out-of-pocket expenses until he/she reaches the plan's deductible. some pros of catastrophic coverage are: catastrophic plans offer more affordable monthly premiums for an individual who might otherwise not purchase insurance coverage at all coverage under such a plan as suggested by its name will at least protect them in the event of a catastrophic event such as a car accident or serious illness that could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills which would plunge many people into bankruptcy the major con of catastrophic coverage is that it covers very few out-of-pocket expenses before the deductible is met and the deductibles under these plans can be quite high. so these plans may not be ideal for individuals who have substantial out-of-pocket expenses. this would include those who take a significant number of prescription drugs on a regular basis and/or find themselves visiting a physician frequently.	what are some of the pros and cons of buying a catastrophic plan?

hi here is some info from the uks daily mails doctor. your concern that it might have affected your fertility is a valid one and needs to be checked out if you don't fall pregnant soon. chlamydia infection can affect the fallopian tubes in a couple of ways. it might lead to the formation of scar tissue in the pelvis which physically blocks the tubes either by kinking or binding the tube down. the infection may also damage the fine hairs which line the inside of the tube and ensure the egg moves down to the uterus. depending on the contraception you used previously it can take a few months for regular ovulation to start up again so you may not have been actually able to fall pregnant for as long as a year. why not discuss this with your gp? he or she would be able to make the appropriate referral to get your tubes checked and start the ball rolling if you don't fall pregnant soon. ok looking at that it would be a good idea to see your doctor and get some tests done. you can get tests done on your tubes they can go in for a looksee who knows your tubes could be blocked that's just a thought. hope you find away. good luck	hello im a 27 yr old woman and i got an iud (mirena) in 2009. i then slept with some one and caught chlamidia in 2010. i also caught hpv when i caught the chlamidia. what i am concerned about is it had to be immediately removed due to the sti. i started hemorrhaging. i was wondering if this could decrease the likely hood of conceiving a child? me and my husband have been trying for about 3 years to get pregnant and we even keep track of my period and ovulation schedule. also what other medical side effects could i be facing? so would anybody maybe know the statistical % of me still being able to get pregnant?
yes you can definitely get out breaks on your mouth but only if you already have one while preforming oral sex. as long as neither of you have an out break at the time oral sex and anything else your into is fine. its the outbreaks that cause the damage so when you have an outbreak mouth or otherwise just abstain from oral sex until the sores are gone. that's my opinion my dad has herpes and that's how he explained it to me.	i have genital herpes can i get sore on my mouth. i and my partner have genital herpes and are wondering if we are still at risk of getting out breaks on our mouths? she has had one outbreak and hasn't had another in close to a year. i just recently had my first outbreak so we are abstaining from sex until two weeks after my outbreaks goes away. what we really want to know is can we perform oral sex on each other when we are both outbreak free? we have been anecdotally told once you have it you are immune to spreading it.

unresolved itching is a truly frustrating symptom for all patients to deal with. because this has been going on for some time you might want to get a medical evaluation to make sure you don't have a disease process that is causing the itching. the fact that you have identified stress as a possible trigger tells me that while it may not be the source of your difficulty it certainly could be making it worse. i would recommend that you look into stress reduction methods that are available in your area. some schools and universities offer programs in stress reduction meditation yoga etc. stress is hard on your entire body and could be negatively impacting other health systems as well as making your itching worse. see what you can do about getting a diagnosis and try to learn to manage your stress levels.	my lower leg has been itching and i’ve had slow-healing sores for five years. is it related to high stress at work?

"when someone is making strong nutrition claims like this i always ask people to inquire about the research used to support the claim. many times people without a health or science background translate information into something that is not accurate. green leafy vegetables contain oxalates but there is no evidence that these foods are bad for health. there are instances where someone may need to limit oxalates such as those who are prone to kidney stones but this is not a concern for the general ""healthy"" population. most people can include green leafy vegetables like those in smoothies as part of a healthy diet. in fact it is encouraged! the 2010 dietary guidelines recommend green leafy vegetables along with those that are orange (sweet potatoes carrots etc. ) starchy (potatoes corn) and other vegetables like cucumbers and zucchini. variety is always best to meet nutritional needs and maximize health. if you are concerned about oxalates check with your health care provider."	i saw an article which said that consuming green smoothie every day may be devastating for your health is that true?

a high thyroglobin antibody level in and of itself does not mean you have thyroid disease. they are found in nearly 20% of all women. however high levels of thyroglobulin antibodies associated with other thyroid antibodies are found in 80 to 90% of people with immune mediated inflammation of the thyroid (hashimoto’s thyroiditis). this is the most common type of thyroid hormone deficiency in the u. s. thyroglobulin antibodies are also found in pregnant women relatives of patients with hashimoto’s thyroiditis and in people with other immune mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes. the usual course of hashimoto's thyroiditis is gradual loss of thyroid function. antibodies to thyroglobulin are considered to occur as a result of damage to the thyroid from special white blood cells (t cells). common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue being cold all the time weight gain constipation dry skin and menstrual irregularities. since these symptoms occur in other diseases it is important not to always blame thyroid deficiency as the cause. fortunately laboratory tests for thyroid function make this diagnosis relatively easy. however because loss of thyroid hormone develops over time and antibodies can herald problems you will want to follow-up with your doctor about your thyroid tests and your symptoms.	what does it mean if your thyroglobin ab are very high but all the others are normal? and how does that affect the body? . i am wondering if the thyroglobin ab being high could correlate to the weight gain(15+ lbs a month and can't lose it) breast enlargement(2 cup sizes) fatigue and lack of menstration. i have been tested for cancer(negative) and i have no family history of these issues. from the research i have done i cannot find an answer so i am hoping that someone could enlighten me so i would have a stepping stone the next time i went to the doctor about this.

hi it will very likely just stop soon. nothing is however guaranteed. don't let your period spoil your vacation. as a matter of fact don't let it spoil anything ever. menstruation is not a disability. it is a fact of life and hundreds of millions of women menstruate every day without it spoiling anything. learn to deal with it effectively and enjoy life. as for being pregnant i don't think so with a 7 day plus period. the only real time to worry is if you miss your period then you can worry good luck	i skipped my period by not taking the placebo sugar pills and just started new pack i got my period. is that normal? . i'm on the pill and skipped the last week to avoid my period because i was going away. i then started a new pack thinking i wouldn't get my period till the end of that month i got my period the 2nd week of the new pack. is that normal? plus i have had it for seven days usual i only get it 3-4 days. can this happen? i'm nervous also thinking to myself can i be pregnant because i messed up the cycle?
i think it depends on his eating overall. if he eats a variety of food but just doesn't like food really sweet that may simply reflect his personal preferences. but if he eats very few foods it could indicate a sensory issue or that he is super taster (not serious -- just more sensitive to the tastes in food). if you feel his nutrition and growth is affected see his pediatrician for a referral to a feeding therapist who can help you figure out what is going on. good luck!	you asked: my son is 6 year old he don't like to eat those food which taste sweet is there any disorder in his taste bud
a lot depends on the reason why you have a high heartrate in the first place. whether or not you are healthy enough for pregnancy depends on so many factors that there's no way anyone could answer that here a chat with your gynecologist or family doctor is a better idea.	my resting heart beat is 90 - 100. is it safe to get pregnant? . i was on metoprolol 50mg twice aday for the past 8 years and recently reduced to 25mg. and now i completely stop the medication. my resting heart beat is around 88 to 90 when sleeping; 105 when sitting or after eating. . is it safe to get pregnant? please advise. thanks for all your help.
and last sorry could not post all this in one go? can you get pregnant from sperm outside your body? if a man ejaculates around the labia of a womans vagina the tail like whip of the sperm may guide it to the inside of a womans vagina. the mission of each sperm is to reach the unfertilized egg and it has no problem with heading in the right direction if the travel occurs quickly it can get inside where it can live up to two weeks in the womans uterus before inpregnation. no once sperm touches oxygen or air it is killed. think of it as bacteria it dies when its not at body temperature. the two answers above are both false. first of all sperm are very fragile and they are not on a mission to reach a woman's egg. truth be told experiment after experiment has shown that sperm have no sense of direction and can't swim very well. thus the reason that millions of sperm must be present and ejaculated inside a woman so that maybe a handful can reach an egg (if present). also sperm don't die when they hit the air they only die once the semen dies. if you don't know semen is the liquid you can see that contains the sperm which you can't see. if the semen is dry the sperm are dead. think about this even under perfect conditions where both people are fertile and healthy the woman is perfectly ovulating and the man ejaculates directly into her vagina the chances of pregnancy are never more than 80%. so if under perfect conditions it is still relatively difficult to get pregnant than it is nearly impossible to get pregnant in any other fashion. put it this way there has never been a case other than the birth of jesus son of mary where a virgin gets pregnant. so in the real world a man can't just ejaculate on a woman and get her pregnant the two must have sex. it is impossible to keep your virginity and get pregnant because sperm must be inside a woman for her to get pregnant and this can't happen if there is no intercourse. if a man ejaculates on a woman's stomach face breasts etc. there is no chance of pregnancy because the sperm can't just waltz into a woman's vagina. many women may say that they didn't have sex and yet got pregnant but this is not the case. knowledge is power. so there you are there all from different sites some doctors and some not but you do have to remember that sperm when ejaculated inside the vagina is there at your cervix now just add all the way it has to travel through thick mucus and then it has to break into the cervix it’s a long way to go i know its there job and add into that its only a small amount of sperm it would not be the full load? so lots to have read and think about. but why not give it a try or trial to see if can be done? but please let us know how you got on. do hope this helps you. good luck	"anyone here who knows of a pregnancy due to ejaculant on fingers being rubbed on vagina during mutual masturbation? . i've read many many replies (on many websites) from doctors regarding the chances of getting pregnant by a small amount of ejaculant on one's hands being rubbed on the vaginal opening. some say ""yes possible b/c it only takes one sperm"" while some say ""very unlikely b/c sperm need to be inserted higher"". i'd like to know: 1) is there any medical professional here who actually knows of a pregnancy happening from such a situation? 2) are there any more scientific studies on this? thanks"

studies tend to support that herpes can be transmitted during non-outbreak periods. unfortunately there is no way to know if the infected person is shedding the herpes virus at the time or if you yourself are susceptible. while persons who are actively infected pose the greatest transmission risk the smaller risk during non-outbreaks can happen. herpes tends to infect the area where the virus was contracted orally or genitally but there is a lot of cross-contamination during various sexual activities that often tend to involve both areas.	genital herpes and oral sex? . if you have oral sex with a women who has genital herpes and hasn't had any out breaks for over 5-8 years can you still be infected? and if yes do you get it in your mouth area or genital area?
that depends (not a pun). laxatives are somewhat unpredictable so individual responses cannot be determined in advance. if he was truly constipated then this gentle stimulant type laxative should work sometime in the next 24 hours but that would depend on the dosage the amount of constipation and of course his individual response. assuming the school has a readily-available toilet for him to use when the fletcher's kicks in he will be fine. i don't know his age but keep in mind that boys often hate to use the bathroom at school due to the lack of cleanliness and privacy. if you don't believe me check it out yourself some day. shy boys tend to urinate in the stalls and will pee on the toilet seats (and floor) so boys refuse to sit on them. many stalls have non-working doors and some elementary school have rules and penalties for using the toilet during class time. some young kids would hold it until they explode rather than miss a recess. so the choice is yours. if you have used this in the past for your son and know what to expect you will need to decide if it is reasonable for him to go to school with a laxative that may still be on-board.	my son took 1 dose of fletchers laxative for kids around 6 this morning. will he be ok to go to school tomorrow?
don’t give up! although you may not be able to exercise for long now you should expect to see less shortness of breath and better cardiovascular endurance the longer you stay consistent with your exercise routine. be sure that you’re not trying to do too much with your exercise. it may be best to start out with a low intensity level of exercise and expanding upon it as tolerated. it may not seem like a lot at first but you can slowly and gradually build up the duration and intensity of your exercise the more that you are able to adhere to it. remember your exercise doesn’t have to be done all in one session. divide it up and takes breaks to rest and recover if you need to and then pick it back up later. you may be able to continually shorten the amount of rest that you take in between sessions to eventually spend more time in a single session. also try building in more opportunities to incorporate more physically activity within your daily routine. try taking the stairs instead of the elevator or park further away. making a habit out of incorporating small opportunities like these can ultimately lead to becoming better conditioned for exercise. if exercise remains to be too difficult i’d still encourage you to continue to do what you can but i’d suggest placing more of an emphasis on your nutrition to lose enough weight until you’re at the point that you can exercise more comfortably. keep up the great work! remember to always consult your doctor before beginning an exercise routine or weight loss plan.	im 314lbs and trying to lose weight. i cant excercise 2 min before im gasping for air. how can i get a work out in?

symptoms of brain tumors vary according to the type of tumor and the location. because different areas of the brain control different functions of the body where the tumor lies affects the way it's manifested. some tumors have no symptoms until they are quite large and then cause a serious rapid decline in health. other tumors may have symptoms that develop slowly. a common initial symptom of a brain tumor is headaches. a lot of things besides a brain tumor can cause headaches though. but brain tumor headaches may be described as worse in the morning and then better after a couple of hours. often they occur when a person is sleeping and will cause the person to wake up. the headache may be accompanied by vomiting and may get worse when the person changes position coughs or exercises. the headaches also typically don't respond well to the usual headache remedies. other common symptoms include: seizures changes in speech or hearing changes in vision balance problems problems with walking numbness or tingling in the arms or legs problems with memory personality changes inability to concentrate weakness in one part of the body. it's important to keep in mind that these symptoms can be caused by a number of different conditions. so you shouldn't assume you have a brain tumor just because you experience some of them. check with your doctor.	what are the symptoms of a brain tumor in adults?
so most people are like michael what could taste possibly have to do with sleep? well from that standpoint what i like to talk to people about is what do you eat before bed if you do eat before bed. so a lot of people they get home from work it’s 8:30 they get the kids to bed and then they are finally sitting down to a meal at 8:30 9:00 at night and then they are going to bed in a couple of hours. the body was not meant to digest lying down. so what ends up happening is that we have a high proclivity for reflux if you’ve eaten and then go ahead and lie down. now we all know a lot about reflux we’ve seen it in the news and there are a lot of medications out there for it but one of the easiest things to do is looking at what it is you’ve put in your body to avoid reflux and then not lying down right after the meal. also there are different foods out there that may or may not have some effect on a person’s ability to fall asleep. things you want to watch out for are sodas before bed because they may have caffeine content as well as the carbonation can give you gas and make you not feel so great when you’re lying down. now caffeine in and of itself i’m not i don’t have a problem with. i love a good cup of coffee and i know most people do. so i don’t really have a problem with it but what i want people to do is use caffeine responsibility and know and understand that if you’re not having a good night’s rest caffeine may be one of the culprits.	how can taste impact the quality of my sleep?
hi a cholesterol level of below 200 is very desirable so 120 would be good. a low triglyceride level is considered less then 50mg/dl and less then 35mg/dl is considered severely low. a triglyceride blood test is the best way to figure out your level. the blood test is performed after an eight- to 12-hour period of fasting to give the most accurate results. it is important to know certain medications cause abnormal test results. so are you really sure it was 24? your hdl 59 is good so at 69 its even better for you. your ldl levels are good at 32 anything below 100 is good. you said. i am now concerned about my mood - very irritable get angry easy and prone to impulsive anxious behaviour. this sounds very much like adhd i would see your own doctor and do go over this with him/her or perhaps your doctor will pass you on to another doctor who specializes in this form of medicine. do hope this helps you. good luck	total cholesterol 120- triglycerides 24- hdl 69- ldl 32- are these counts seriously low? . i am a man aged 38. i exercise daily and am a regular in endurance sports. abut 8 years ago i had depression and anxiety issues and on going panic attacks. i am now concerned about my mood - very irritable get angry easy and prone to impulsive anxious behaviour. of course i hate this and have no real sense of stability. any ideas what i am looking at here? why are my values so low given that i have a very healthy diet and exercise daily. help.

kegel exercises also called pelvic floor exercises help strengthen the muscles that support the bladder uterus and bowels. by strengthening these muscles you can reduce or prevent urinary leakage problems. to do kegel exercises pretend you are trying to stop the flow of urine or trying not to pass gas. when you do this you are contracting the muscles of the pelvic floor. while doing these exercises try not to move your leg buttock or abdominal muscles. in fact no one should be able to tell that you are doing kegel exercises. kegel exercises should be done every day five sets a day. each time you contract the muscles of the pelvic floor hold for a slow count of five and then relax. repeat this 10 times for one set of kegels.	what are kegel exercises?
aerobic exercise is great to help expend calories and boost metabolism to promote weight loss. keep in mind however that you can’t “spot reduce” weight loss meaning that you can’t do a certain exercise to target weight loss from a particular part of your body. the surgeon general recommends 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise 5 days per week 60 minutes is even better if your goal is to lose weight. these recommendations are cut in half however if you do vigorous intensity exercise instead of moderate intensity. also be sure to also include strength training into your routine as well. visit this cdc website for more information on exercise recommendations.	is aerobics a good exercise to loose fat in belly?
"i'm sorry you're experiencing this. it sounds painful and a little scary. what you're describing sounds like a lump in the skin which is good because these aren't usually anything serious like cancer. also the fact you have a similar lump in the other armpit is actually good news in this case because scary lumps like breast cancer don't usually present on both sides at the same time. you have a couple of options here. you can wait to see what happens. if this lump is a cyst it may eventually open on its own. you can try applying warm moist compresses several times a day to see if you can ""draw out"" the fluid from inside the lump. do not squeeze the lump or attempt to puncture lance or otherwise open it on your own. this can lead to serious infection. if the lump opens on its own allow it to drain freely by placing clean (if not sterile) gauze loosely over the wound. you may apply antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. then allow the wound to close on its own. you also could go see a doctor for a diagnosis. if this is a large cyst you may benefit from having it surgically drained or removed. if you develop a fever or more bumps you definitely should seek medical attention. wishing you well!"	armpit lump. i thought it was a spider bite at first since i got the same thing under my other armpit. but i can tell this isn't a bite. it's extremely painful even to move my arm for everyday activity and the lump is very defined and huge. i even noticed a very small lump growing above it. i don't know if it's getting to a risky point. i've only had it for about a week now and it's terrible. no head to drain it even when i try to bring pus to the service. i'd like to know what i should do.

most helpful answer the answer here isn't quite as straightforward as you might think so let me try to explain. it's true an ecg doesn't look inside the body the way an angiogram does. however an ecg does trace the heart's electrical conduction system. if an artery in the heart has become blocked and caused a portion of the heart muscle to die this can affect the electrical conduction system. and that damage in turn would be reflected on an ecg. that's probably why your relative's cardiologist is going directly to angioplasty. actually the physician likely will perform an angiogram first then do the angioplasty immediately afterwards. instead of having to undergo two procedures your relative will only go through one. that's healthier in many ways. it reduces infection risk and your relative will only have to recover one time instead of two. if your relative has any questions about why his or her cardiologist is choosing this particular treatment your relative should speak up. every patient has a right to know why a procedure is being performed what the expected outcome is and what the recovery will be like. communication is key in getting great medical treatment and sometimes that communication has to start with the patient. best wishes to you and your relative!	can a doctor decide that if there is any blockage in blood vein by doing ecg? . one of my relative had a chest pain n hospitalized immediately. he has been monitored closely by a cardiac doctor and by doing an ecg the doctor concluded that he has a block in blood vein and need to be removed by doing angioplasty. but he never done angiogram!

caffeine is legal and prevalent in foods such as chocolate and drinks such as coffee and sodas. but experts claim it's still a drug and should be limited. caffeine has been a controversial subject in fda guidelines. in the early 1980s the fda released a study that stated caffeine use had toxic results in studies of rats. however this warning has since been loosened a bit. pregnant women who need caffeine should regulate their intake. it can cause low birth weight and irritability if taken in large quantities.

sinusitis may be classified in several ways based on the time span of the problem (acute subacute or chronic) and the type of inflammation (either infectious or noninfectious). acute sinus infection (also termed acute sinusitis caused by infection) is usually defined as being of less than 30 days duration. subacute sinus infection as being over 1 month but less than 3 months. chronic sinus infection as being greater than 3 months duration. there is no medical consensus on the above time periods. infected sinusitis usually is caused by uncomplicated virus infection. less frequently bacterial growth causes sinus infection and fungal sinus infection is very infrequent. subacute and chronic forms of sinus infection usually are the result of incomplete treatment of an acute sinus infection. noninfectious sinusitis is caused by irritants and allergic conditions and follows the same general time line for acute subacute and chronic as infectious sinusitis.	what are the types of sinus infections?

sorry to hear about this rash. how annoying! rashes are difficult to diagnose without a physical examination. it's certainly possible that too much sun exposure caused your rash but it seems odd it would only be on one side of the face. if your rash becomes painful and turns to blisters and if you've ever had chickenpox then you should be alert to the possibility this could be shingles. shingles is a bit unusual in someone your age but it's not unheard of. shingles can be contagious so if you develop the above symptoms i'd advise calling your primary care provider and letting him or her know about your rash so he or she can determine if you should come into the office. also if you develop those symptoms stay away from anyone who has not had chickenpox in order to avoid giving them the virus. chances are your rash is not serious and will clear up on its own. if it gets worse or doesn't clear up within a few days i'd suggest you visit your health care provider. good luck to you!	hi i woke up with a red bumps on my left cheek. it doesnt look like acne. i was in the sun yesterday are they sunspots? . i am fifteen years old. i get pimples/acne every now and then. but this doesnt look like acne. theyre red bumbs all over my cheek. they aren't itchy but my face feels warm when i touch it. i dont have any allergies that i am aware of and i dont think i ate something that might have caused this. i was in the sun yesterday. do you think that's what caused it. please help me. . thank you. -sarah
the fatigue you feel from having cancer and receiving radiation therapy can be overwhelming and keep you from doing the things you normally do such as going to work or spending time with family and friends. it's also unpredictable and can seem different from day to day which makes it hard to plan around it. it can even interfere with how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. sometimes doctors can discover other causes for the fatigue. when they do the cause can be treated. there are things you can do to make fatigue less disabling: take care of your health. the level of fatigue you feel is often related to the condition of your health at the time of treatment. review with your doctor how well you are following your treatment plan not just for cancer but for other health conditions you may have. be sure you're taking your medications the way you're supposed to. get plenty of rest increase your level of physical activity and continue to eat a nutritious diet with plenty of protein. work with a counselor or take a class offered at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy reduce stress and use distraction to not focus on the fatigue. prioritize your regular activities so you can do the ones that are most important to you first when you feel less fatigued. maintain a balance between rest and activities. too much bed rest can make you more fatigued. but don't over-schedule your activities without allowing time to rest. talk with your family and friends and ask for their help. if fatigue is interfering with your job discuss your situation with your employer and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. keep in mind that the fatigue related to radiation therapy will most likely be temporary and will pass several weeks after your radiation treatment ends.	what can i do about fatigue that results from radiation therapy?

"hepatitis c is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis c virus. technically since hepatitis c is an infectious disease one might think that an infectious disease specialist (a subspecialty of internal medicine) would be the appropriate medical specialist to see. hepatitis c is more than a simple infection however. it usually is a chronic infection that often is associated with important damage to the liver. because of this fact patients with hepatitis c are most commonly referred for treatment to a specialist in gastroenterology (also a subspecialty of internal medicine). gastroenterologists specialize in diseases of all of the gastrointestinal organs including the liver. moreover there are gastroenterologists who specialize in diseases of the liver including hepatitis c. these specialists are called hepatologists. (""hepar"" means liver. ) whether patients with hepatitis c are treated by gastroenterologists or hepatologists depends on the expertise (gastroenterology or hepatology) available in the community the severity of any associated liver disease and the complexity of the contemplated treatment."	what kind of medical specialist treats hepatitis c?

the risk of pregnancy in using routine antibiotics and birth control pills (bcps) is very low. in fact antifungals (e. g. ketoconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin azythromycin biaxin) actually increased blood levels of estradiol--not decrease them. being late taking some bcps can also increase [the] risk of pregnancy but the risk is not large unless you entirely miss for two to three days. unprotected sex on active pills does not increase risk unless you had just completely missed several days of active pills. . i would urge you to do a reliable pregnancy test. for the most accurate answer you can do one test on the first day of your next pack. .	while on birth control i took an antibiotic and was late taking birth control pills. could i be pregnant if i had sex?

there are problems with the fat burning option on the cardio machines and it really ought to be eliminated. the idea behind the fat-burning option is this: because fat is denser than carbohydrate it requires more oxygen to burn. so to maximize the percentage of fat you burn compared to carbohydrate the fat-burning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles. that generally means a slow pace to keep you from getting breathless. the problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed you burn fewer total calories -- from both carbohydrate and fat -- because you simply don't do as much work. further the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range (usually 60% to 85% of your maximum heart rate) which is hard to do at slower speeds. and fitness is ultimately what you're after whether your goals are better health burning calories or improving heart and lung capacity. the bottom line is that the fat-burning mode probably won't be intense enough to maximize total calorie- or fat-burning or to help you increase or maintain optimum fitness levels. use the cardio mode to maximize your exercise benefits. using the fat burning mode on exercise machines at the gym actually isn’t the best way to burn fat. the key concepts to understand here are the percentage of calories that come from fat and total calories. the fat burning mode is typically set at lower exercise intensity where more calories burned come from fat. not as many calories burned during higher exercise intensity will come from fat. the point to understand though is that while more of the calories that you burn will come from fat at a lower exercise intensity you have the potential to burn more calories per session doing higher exercise intensity. the percentage of calories burned from fat will be lower during the higher exercise intensity but you will be burning more calories overall including the amount of calories from fat. also higher exercise intensity leads to a greater boost in metabolism even after you’re done exercising which burns additional calories. it’s best to do exercise that you’re comfortable with and that meets your level of training/conditioning. in general however increasing the time spent on exercise and increasing exercise intensity will provide a greater potential to burn more calories and lose weight.	what's the difference between the fat-burning mode and the cardio mode on the machines at the gym?

workers comp -- i assume that's what w/c stands for -- operates differently than other types of medical insurance. health insurers cannot deny you coverage any longer because of a pre-existing medical condition. however care covered under worker's comp functions differently. typically to be covered by workers comp your medical condition must be the result of an injury directly related to your work. your employer pays the bills for injuries or worsening physical condition caused by an injury that happened on the job. if it can prove that you had the same condition prior to filing the claim your employer can argue that the condition already existed and is not the result of a work-related injury. in that case you may not receive coverage. in that case you would need to have your condition covered by your health insurance assuming you have coverage.	why is that i recently fell at work went to er for eval and i have a pre-existing condition w/c won't treat-tumor. my ortho dr knows about this was examined by dr prior to fall. now won't see me for this pre-existing condition. i am now is severe pain due to fall what do i do?

the metabolism calculator likely is using the harris-benedict equation which is a method to estimate your basal metabolic rate (bmr) and daily calorie requirements. the variables that this equation takes into consideration are age height weight gender and activity level. keep in mind that this is an indirect method of calorie assessment and is only an estimate. there are other equations but this is typically the equation that most registered dietitians use.	webmd's metabolsim calculator. i have a book that uses weight in lbs x 11 x 1. 6 as the formula for caloric needs from basic daily activities. which gives me a much greater number then webmd's calculator. i am a 41 year old male. <link>

twenty percent to 50% of travelers may develop diarrhea depending on the region of the world they visit. diarrhea is the most common illness of travelers. in general travelers at risk for diarrhea commonly come from industrialized nations and travel to high-risk areas that are primarily within developing or less industrialized nations of the world including latin america africa the middle east and asia. areas of lesser risk include china and some caribbean nations. travel to areas of the u. s. canada northern europe and australia pose the lowest risk to travelers. men and women are at equal risk for developing travelers' diarrhea. younger individuals are more commonly afflicted perhaps because of more adventurous eating habits. people with disorders that compromise their immune system (such as hiv cancer chemotherapy steroid use) diabetes patients and people with underlying abdominal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome colitis) are more susceptible to travelers' diarrhea. interestingly people on acid blockers for their stomachs -- such as famotidine (pepcid) cimetidine (tagamet) omeprazole (prilosec) and esomeprazole (nexium) -- also have a higher susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea because they have less stomach acid to protect them from the bacteria that cause the condition.	how common is travelers' diarrhea?
i don't necessarily think this is going to save you money. believe it or not xl and cds and things like that are actually once a day formulations which means you don't have to purchase as much of the medication for it to work for what the doctor or healthcare provider is trying to treat you. we found that a lot of people even struggle with just taking their medication once a day if you don't have this extended release formulation you have to take it two three four times a day. i found out a lot of patients forget or don't take it at all. so in the long run it actually costs you money because you are not taking your medication in the right way. you are actually going to probably get sicker and maybe go to the emergency room or visit your doctor a little bit more and in the long run healthcare cost go up. drugs are a small component of that and i think a lot of people underestimate how important it is that these extended release products are actually a benefit and worth the money.	how can avoiding medications with xl la xr or cr in their name save me money?

pain associated with migraines is a very individualized symptom. it isn't a symptom that a health care professional can visually see to measure the intensity. we rely on the patient to give specifics on the tolerability and type of pain so we can better identify the type of medication that will work specifically for your type of pain and the location of the pain. without knowing more about your pain i would not be able to tell you which medication is better. i can inform you a bit more about the details of each medication. one common ingredient in all three of these products is acetaminophen which functions to increase the effects of the primary pain reliever. in addition to acetaminophen darvocet contains propoxephene. tylenol no. 3 contains codeine. lortab contains hydrocodone. these medications are the primary pain relievers. they also cause drowsiness. while analgesics (acetaminophen) nsaids and narcotics relieve pain they don't address the underlying physiology of the migraine which is primarily the dilation of blood vessels in the brain causing pressure on nerves in such a tight closure of an area. two classes of migraine drugs that can aid with the dilation of blood vessels in the brain are ergotamines and triptans.	what will work better for migraine relief: darvocet-n 100 tylenol with codeine no. 3 or lortab?

"sun damage and smoking are the no. 1 reasons for premature aging or wrinkling of the skin. therefore you should incorporate the use of sunblock in your daily skin-care regimen. next utilize a daily skin regimen that exfoliates your skin which will help remove dead skin cells. this should be followed by a non-comedogenic moisturizer that contains vitamins (c & e) and rebuilds peptides for your skin. use a very dramatic moisturizer! i use multiple moisturizers and it seriously takes away my laugh lines and wrinkles. and i smile all the time. try using moisturizers that are for dry skin. i use several natural oatmeal moistorizers that work and i use a heavy body butter around the area that i have most trouble with and a gentle baby lotion for the areas i dont have trouble with. you can also use natural exfoliators i have noticed they work so much better than commercial ones! try baking soda and water apply to face keep it on for a minute or two (never longer than 3 min because of the result of skin irritation) grab a rag and put cool water on it and gently wipe it off. sometimes if it doesn't all come off and you can still feel the particles on your face then i put my face under the faucet. you can do it however you want though but you can instantly tell the difference between your first try! don't stop smiling! our body is like a computer. garbage in garbage out. i highly recommend that you look at your diet. are you eating a lot of processed foods? there is not much nutrition in processed foods if any. in my opinion even organic processed food is garbage. once something has been processed it is dead food. are you eating fresh fruits and vegetables (preferably organic so your immune system can heal your skin and does not have to fight all the chemicals in conventional foods)? raw unprocessed nuts? eggs (yes they are really good for you! ) stay away from conventional meats and dairy? it is truly true. you are what you eat! make it an adventure to discover real food not stuff that comes from a box. you will see your skin become as it should be at your age luminous and supple. granted it takes a little effort but once you see the results in your skin (and you will) you gladly eat at home and make it a home cooked meal. highly recommend you study up on healthy nutrition maybe take a cooking course. i am 64 and almost wrinkle free my weight is normal and i can pass for 50. that is what good nutrition can do for you. my best wishes to you r. d. externally there are topical line relaxers the most effective target just the line you want to treat. the line fillers are meant to ""fill in"" your lines but don't seem to work too well for me. i think regular consistent care of the skin is the most important thing you can do. routinely moisturize your skin twice a day face and neck. shower and then follow with a good thick moisturizer that has vitamins c e a with hyaluronic acid and sunscreen. avoid products with alcohol as an ingredient as this will dry and damage new skin. clean skin at night and use a good night cream. personally i love the olay refinishing night cream makes skin so soft and smells great. internally drink water and eat your berries & veggies. take a b vitamin complex with biotin fish oil and a multivitamin. if your lines don't respond to a line relaxer and twice daily tlc a precription for retinol may do the trick. i personally find these creams effective: strivectin lift cream really lifts! the newest neutrogena tone improving moisturizer is a nice effective cream that brightens skin well the olay refinishing line helps with surface problems such as large pores. i also use vitamin e oil and collagen(absorbed through skin) about once a week after a shower on wet skin. allover. then of course there's always botox."	i'm 24 but laugh lines and forehead wrinkles are already apparent on my face. can i slow them down?
scientists aren't sure what causes migraines including migraines without aura. it's thought that at least two brain chemicals -- serotonin and dopamine -- play a role. the theory is something goes awry in the way these chemicals regulate brain function. this causes the brain and the body's immune system to overreact. when that happens a flood of immune response cells flows through the blood vessels to the brain. the brain's blood vessels open wider to accommodate these cells. then even more chemicals are released to help control the vessels' muscles. the vessels open and constrict. a severe sometimes throbbing headache results. factors suspected of causing migraines include genetics and being overweight. substances behaviors and environment may also trigger migraines. it is known that migraines often run in families. they frequently begin in childhood and worsen through adolescence. although more boys than girls have migraines more adult women than adult men have migraines. over time the number of migraines lessens. migraines become rare after age 50.	what causes a migraine without aura?

with bipolar disorder you alternate between episodes of depression and mania. in between you may return completely to normal or have some remaining symptoms. the extreme mood changes may come on suddenly or appear more slowly. during a manic episode you may be abnormally happy energetic or very irritable for a week or more. initially you may feel incredibly productive or creative. you may feel powerful and seductive and think there is nothing you can't accomplish. but as a manic episode progresses you may behave wildly and irresponsibly spending a lot of money getting involved in dangerous activities and sleeping very little. you may also have a hard time functioning in your job and relationships. after a manic episode you may return to normal or your mood may swing in the opposite direction and you may feel useless hopeless and extremely sad. when you are depressed you may have trouble concentrating remembering and making decisions. you may have changes in your eating and sleeping habits. and you may lose interest in things you have enjoyed in the past. some people become suicidal or harm themselves during episodes of depression. some feel as if they can't move care or think. men tend to have more manic episodes while women have more episodes of depression. 6 initially stress may trigger depression or mania. but as the illness progresses mood swings may not be caused by any specific event. without treatment your bipolar disorder may get worse causing you to move more often between mania and depression. people with bipolar disorder are more likely to have one or more risk factors of cardiovascular disease including obesity high blood pressure and diabetes. 7 your physical health will be watched closely by your doctor. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get bipolar disorder?
what you are describing is what i think a blood boil. most people get them like under the arm where you sweat are inside the leg near the scrotch or vagina area. and they can be very painful. my suggestion is to sit in a warm tub of water for as long as you can to get it soft do not put soap in it but put something like lysol the concentrated kind it will kill the germs and it will help as an disinfectant. it will keep the infection down;. it may break on its own and if it does it will have some pus and maybe some blood. in a tub a warm water as warm as you can stand it put about 2 capfuls of lysol only the kind that is concentrated it should come in a brown bottle. you might could find it in a drug store or in a grocery store where the laundry soap is found. but that is only a temporary fix. if it doesn't pop on its own then go to a doctor he will likely look and see exactly what it is and prescribe antibiotics to help it go away. i went to a doctor cause i had something similar and she popped mine and then she prescribed some medicine and then it went away and i have never had one since. so please seek treatment whatever you feel like is the best option and please let us know what you decide to do. i do hope that you get to feeling better and please keep us informed of your health. we do care and we want to help. thank you	painful 1 inch swelling between anus and scrotum not a pimple under the skin gives me fever help? . hi . i have a swelling between my scrotum and anus closer to the scrotum . it's size has increased in the last two days . i have had it for 4 days now it's excruciatingly painful. i have no idea what it is and what to do. . plus it gives me fever so i have taken small doses of paracetamol . it's still somewhat manageable if its kept warm. can you please tell what is it and how can i get better? ways to treat it? . any help would be really really appreciated! . thank you!

this very important medical exam component is usually performed standing with the medical provider sitting on a stool. the underwear can be pulled down if the patient is not completely disrobed and wearing a gown. the provider should be wearing gloves. the exam in painless only takes a few minutes checking for inguinal hernias or scrotal or testicular masses. there should be an educational component about self-examination for testicular masses and of course ample time should be provider to address any private questions that the young man may have at the time. the exam is done in private and if possible a same-sex clinician can be requested if the young man is shy.	how are young men's genital exams performed - with the patient standing or supine? underwear on or off? wearing gloves?

"this is an issue of concern for many families. the law states that employer-sponsored health insurance is ""affordable"" if individual coverage doesn't exceed 9. 5% of your annual income. it doesn't include the cost of family coverage which is obviously much higher. under the law if you have an offer of affordable employer coverage you're not eligible for subsidies through the marketplaces meaning your family will have to pay the full cost of coverage with no financial assistance from the government. you can shop outside of the marketplace if you wish and if you're not eligible for a tax credit you may find broader options available to you. you can work with an agent."	"i currently have health insurance through my employer. to add my husband and child it would be over $1 000 a month since my employer only covers my portion of the insurance. from what i've heard we would fall into the ""family penalty"" group and would not qualify for a subsidy since it would be considered affordable due to my insurance cost and not the family insurance cost. are there any options for us and would we still be able to shop in the marketplace even with the ""family penalty""?"

most helpful answer a gastroenterologist is a licensed and highly-trained physician. many were primary care clinicians before they specialized. while a vaginal exam may not be integral part of his/her practice finding the underlying reason for undiagnosed abdominal pain may require more than just a short trip up the colon or down the throat to the stomach. pelvic causes for abdominal pain are really high on the list so this clinician is most likely being very thorough. they are definitely allowed to do this exam if there is a justifiable reason to do so. now if your podiatrist or a chiropractor wanted to do a vaginal exam i would call that highly-suspicious.	are gastroenterologist allowed to perform vaginal exams on a patient who complains about abdominal pain?
he probably does have it so it would be best if you both are treated. a false negative test is not uncommon. don't worry about where you got it (one of your non-condom-wearing sexual partners gave it to you; that is for sure). if you both get treated you should both be clear as long as no one strays. to be on the same side it would be best for your partner to use a condom from now on since honest in sexual relationship are often suspect.	how do i have chlamydia and he dont? . i went to get put on birthcontrol since we weren't being very safe about sex. while i was there i went ahead and got tested turns out i have chlamydia. i went ahead and told him he went and got tested his results were negative. ive only had unprotected sex with 1 guy years ago and i got tested after i broke up with him. i don't understand where it came from and why he doesn't have it also

hello i have been through your same problems. it is not a comfortable situation. when i had this problem i went to my family md. first he did a urine test. well this was all it took to figure out that i had a very bad bladder infection. bladder infections can cause nausea back pain leakage burning when you urinate and some pelvic pain. in my opinion i would go see my dr. but until you can get into the dr. i would not drink any sodas any caffine alcohol or anything with high acid ( things like oj). drink lots of water. but i would go to the store and get some cranberry juice or in the pharmacy in the vitamins section there is a cranberry pill that is a very high concentrated cranberry oil. which helps to clean your urinary tract. one of these (the juice or the pills) will help you out a lot. just follow the instuctions on the back of the bottle of pills or if you are going to drink the juice i would drink 4-6 ounces 4 times a day. until you see the dr. info from someone who has been through this. i take cranberry pills everyday now. i have not had as many problems with this anymore and i strated taking the pills this about 3 years ago. if you do start this. make sure to talk to your dr. about it when you see him for your appointment. good luck to you. i hope this helps you and anyone else that may read this. god bless	im having lower back pains and im having pains in my pelvic area and i am leaking urine for no reason. . i have to use the restroom about every hour. i feel sick every time i wake up. i have no idea whats going on. i have never had a kid before. i dont know what kind of doctor i need to see!

yes you can do this but remember that a fever -- especially a mild one in a child -- is actually helpful in fighting a virus. a fever is the one of the body's most powerful immune responses so it is not necessary or even medically recommended to treat a fever. you can however treat the discomfort associated with a fever so if your little one seems uncomfortable just use the acetaminophen or ibuprofen products that you mentioned. mucinex is a mucous-thinning agent and will not necessarily help a cough. loosened mucous can drain down a child's throat at night and actually make a cough worse so please keep that in mind. during the day mucinex is certainly okay. use saline nose sprays/drops and use a cool mist humidifier. colds last about a week but some symptoms like runny nose or cough can hang on longer. don't over-treat a cold.	my5 year old has a viral infection is it safe to give her mucinex with tylenol or motrin she gets a fever. the mucinex is just for cough

most helpful answer need to? probably not. desire to? you bet. studies have shown that 90% of all men masturbate and the other 10% are probably lying. religious dogma aside there is nothing wrong with masturbation for men or women. does it improve sex life? maybe but if done excessively instead of sexual intimacy then the answer would be no. your wife should not be shocked by this normal natural act of self-pleasure and you should definitely talk about it. every man masturbates; there’s nothing wrong with it and it actually helps improve a man’s sexual ability by making him knowledgeable about what stimulation his penis responds to and in many cases by helping a man learn how to prolong his need to ejaculate. it also seems to help keep the prostate healthier which is a great thing. masturbating often makes a penis sore of course so do regularly use a top drawer penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) with a high end emollient like shea butter and a natural hydrator like vitamin e. hi found you some links they may help you both but it is a funny thing when our wives either catch us or find the wet hanky whoops? <link> <link> and this last link is so she can join you <link> there’s lots to read it wont hurt both of you if you read them together naked if you can the dodson ones your find are good. do hope this helps you. good luck	my wife is upset with me because she caught me mastubating but i read somewhere that men need to. is that true? . i read somewhere that masturbation is essential for men and can actually improve sex life. i want to know if this is true so i can talk to my wife about it. please advise.

severe heartburn and asthma often go hand-in-hand. recent studies show that up to 89% of those with asthma also suffer from severe heartburn known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). gerd generally occurs at night when the sufferer is lying down. normally a valve between the esophagus and stomach prevents stomach acids from backing up into the esophagus. in gerd the valve does not function properly. the stomach acids reflux or back up into the esophagus; if the acid reaches into the throat or airways the irritation and inflammation can trigger an asthma attack. certain clues that suggest reflux as the cause of asthma include the onset of asthma in adulthood no family history of asthma no history of allergies or bronchitis difficult-to-control asthma or coughing while lying down. if your doctor suspects this problem he or she may recommend specific tests to look for it.	can heartburn “trigger” asthma?

pain in this area especially in a person who has been coughing for a week could indicate a few different things but unfortunately the exact cause could not be determined based solely on symptoms. he would need to be examined and perhaps have another chest x-ray (findings can change). basilar pneumonia (pneumonia the lower parts of the lungs can cause chest pain). someone who is coughing can have muscle strain of the intercostal (between the rib) muscles. finally people who cough often swallow a great deal of air. when this air is trapped in the large intestines it can migrate upward under the ribs and cause pain due to pressure against the diaphragm. there can be other causes of course. you are right to be concerned so please see his medical provider again.	why is my son having chest pain and his lower left and right sides hurt? . my son has been coughing for a while over 2 weeks he then started wheezing. he was giving an inhaler to use and some chest xrays were done for pneumonia and that came back negative. they did notice some cloudiness on the right side of his chest. he has been complaining of chest pains. he is now saying that his lower left and right sides hurt right above his waist closer to his back. i am concerned. his pulse was a 57-60 last week i took him to the er and they gave him 2 breathing treatments.
an ankle sprain happens to many people. if you have been walking and there is a ditch or the road is lower your ankle can turn and cause and injury to the ligaments. ankle sprains can be mild moderate or severe. if you have injured only a little bit of the ligament you may be able to walk on the foot and just have mild swelling. with a more severe sprain you will not be able to walk. most importantly it is important to treat the ankle well while healing. this means full rest elevation of the ankle ice and medicine to reduce the swelling. stay off of that foot either resting or with crutches for at least 7-10 days. if you did not do that it is possible that the ankle ligament is not properly healed. in your case its important to see your doctor again if it is still causing you pain.	i sprained my ankle over a month ago and i still have pains. . . i am sure it was over a month ago give or take a few days. but i am still experiencing pains in the back of my ankle on top and on the side some. i have went to the doctor and they did an x-ray and said things looked fine but since i am still having problems i feel like something else is wrong. could i possibly have a fracture or is it just a prolonged pain? .

"psoriatic arthritis is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (arthritis). psoriasis is a common skin condition affecting 2% of the caucasian population in the united states. it features patchy raised red areas of skin inflammation with scaling. psoriasis often affects the tips of the elbows and knees the scalp the navel and around the genital areas or anus. approximately 10% of patients who have psoriasis also develop an associated inflammation of their joints. patients who have inflammatory arthritis and psoriasis are diagnosed as having psoriatic arthritis. the onset of psoriatic arthritis generally occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life. males and females are affected equally. the skin disease (psoriasis) and the joint disease (arthritis) often appear separately. in fact the skin disease precedes the arthritis in nearly 80% of patients. however the arthritis may precede the psoriasis in up to 15% of patients. in some patients the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis can be difficult if the arthritis precedes psoriasis by many years. in fact some patients have had arthritis for over 20 years before psoriasis eventually appears! conversely patients can have psoriasis for over 20 years prior to the development of arthritis leading to the ultimate diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis is a systemic rheumatic disease that also can cause inflammation in body tissues away from the joints other than the skin such as in the eyes heart lungs and kidneys. psoriatic arthritis shares many features with several other arthritic conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis reactive arthritis (formerly known as reiter's syndrome) and arthritis associated with crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. all of these conditions can cause inflammation in the spine and other joints and the eyes skin mouth and various organs. in view of their similarities and tendency to cause inflammation of the spine these conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies.

natural estrogen is cardioprotective as it increases the level of hdl (high-density lipoprotein) and decreases the level of ldl (low-density lipoprotein). oxidation of ldl cholesterol is believed to be the initiator of atherosclerosis. estradiol and other estrogens are believed to inhibit this process. hormone replacement therapy - hrt rapidly increases the level of c-reactive proteins in the body a marker of inflammation associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. recently two major studies found that hrt in postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer. another study proved that hrt in postmenopausal women increases the risk of cardiac events and thrombosis. hence women should be advised to cease therapy postmenopause. however a detailed analysis showed that the time of initiating hrt postmenopause plays a crucial role. when initiated within five years of menopause in a healthy woman estrogen-based hrt has far more benefits than adverse outcomes. the pros of hrt includes: reduces symptoms of menopause. reduce osteoporosis dementia and colon cancer. improves cardiovascular system. the cons of hrt are: doubles the risk of thromboembolism. doubles the risk of breast cancer. so pros and cons are to be evaluated before initiating hrt in postmenopausal women. for more information consult a cardiologist online --><link>	Hello doctor,I have a question. Estrogen shows cardioprotective effect before menopause. But, it increases the risk of CVS diseases if taken in oral contraceptive pills. And, they say that oral contraceptive pills should be avoided after 40 years because of CVS complications. I am not getting it. If it is cardioprotective, then why cannot it be given after 40 when estrogen levels in the body decrease? Also, I wanted to know, whether these side effects of oral contraceptive pills are dose dependent. Because, normally in young women estrogen is cardioprotective, but if given extra from the outside, it is increased in the body than required and so, it cause complications. Is this true?

the developing fetus depends on the mother to supply oxygen for growth and survival. oxygen dissolved in her blood is transferred through the placenta to the fetus. uncontrolled asthma causes a decrease in the mother’s oxygen which in turn reduces the oxygen available to the developing fetus. this may result in impaired fetal growth; it could even affect survival of the fetus. uncontrolled/severe asthma can have several serious consequences on both mom and the baby. high blood pressure preterm labor premature births seizures in the infant and lung trauma and death of the mother etc most of these are complications from either not using medications or underutilizing them while a woman is pregnant. it's important to know your personal asthma triggers and learn ways to avoid them. knowing the early signs of an attack and starting treatment right away are also critical. have an asthma plan in place and know when to go to the er. many people wait until it's too late and the symptoms are severe. this makes asthma deadly.	how does severe uncontrolled asthma adversely affect a fetus?

a dry powder inhaler (dpi) is a device for inhaling respiratory medications that come in powder form.	what is a dry powder inhaler?
the short answer is this: if your doctor put you on this regimen then he or she feels it's safe. if you're concerned about this pain control regimen for some reason then i'd suggest you make an appointment with your doctor to discuss the situation. your health care provider can explain why he or she feels this is a good regimen for you. you as the patient have the right to expect a full explanation of your medication regimen from your health care team and to have your concerns heard. if you don't feel your doctor is responding appropriately to your concerns then you may feel free to get a second opinion. you deserve a doctor or nurse practitioner or physician assistant who listens to your concerns and responds appropriately. i hope this helps! no it is not. the reason is that vicodin has 500mg of tylenol per pill already. vicodin also has hydrocodone which is safer on your body than ibuprofrin or asprin. i also have arthritis and ruptured discs and took oxycontin and vicodin for 6 years with no problems. its when i quit the narcotics and started taking high doses of ibuprofrin and tylenol that i started crapping blood due to stomache bleeding-- due to ibuprofrin. narcotics are addictive but so is tacobell! at least the oxy didnt rip holes in my stomache. and now im off the oxy and i can tell you there not as addictive as everyone will tell you. i took 180mg per day for 6 years. and now i dont. so the point is narcotics are always your best bet for pain. they are way more effective and less harmful! and no one is ever going to tell it to you straight like i am doing now! good luck	is it safe to take 1000 mg tylenol 500 mg ibuprofen and 675 mg of aspirin 4-5 times a day? . i'm 56 years old and i've had two strokes. i have pain in my knees lower and upper spine (due to damage) and arthritic pain in various joints. i also tend to get sinus headaches almost daily. in other words i am in constant pain some days (cold & damp) worse than others. my doctor has me taking 1000 mg acetominaphen 500 mg ibuprofen and 675 mg aspirin 4 to 5 times a day. is this safer than taking 5 mg vicodin 4-5 times a day?

a better goal than focusing on scale weight is to keep track of body fat. the goals should be to decrease body fat and optimize bone strength. for a man a body fat percentage of 18% to 25% is not bad for 40-plus. for women 40-plus 22% to 27% is not bad. to get that body fat percentage you need to have excellent fitness to maintain a good muscle base. also a man should have a waist circumference below 40 inches and a woman below 35 inches.	should my goal weight increase when i hit midlife?

the basic cause of heartburn is an underactive lower esophageal sphincter or les that doesn't tighten as it should. two excesses often contribute to this problem: too much food in the stomach (overeating) or too much pressure on the stomach (frequently from obesity or pregnancy). certain foods commonly relax the les including tomatoes citrus fruits garlic onions chocolate coffee alcohol caffeinated products and peppermint. dishes high in fats and oils (animal or vegetable) often lead to heartburn as do certain medications. stress increases acid production and can cause heartburn. and smoking which relaxes the les and stimulates stomach acid is a major contributor.	what causes heartburn?
many people have lower/normal body temperatures. you do not have to calculate a higher temperature concern based on this lower temperature. extremely high temperatures capable of causing problems will usually have a discoverable cause most likely a biological event. seasoned medical providers only use body temperature as just one of the evaluative guidelines but do not put a lot of emphasis on the measurement. people tend to fear fevers but fever is the body's normal response to fighting infection so in most cases it should not even be pharmacologically-lowered using drugs. it should be welcomed not feared.	"lower normal body temperature = lower ""dangerous"" high fever temperature? . despite no hypothyroidism diagnosis from blood test & family history my normal temp is always a little low. i've been tracking my bbt for several months now and during follicular phase it's rarely above 36. 1 c. if ""average"" is 37 c and based on that average ""dangerously high"" is 39. 4 c should i be concerned at 39. 4 or something lower? last night i hit 38. 8 and it turns out i have strep throat. the dr. i saw today took note of my temps but said nothing."

well i have tried to look up on line what the 10 or 13 herbs are without success. the problem with taking in herbs in general are they are not regulated and many times physicians don't know what the ingredients are. having said that there are not too many products that are found to be harmful to the unborn fetus. plus if you are not feeling well we many times will say it is ok to take different medications during pregnancy. cough drops are one that usually will not cause any specific harm. the real question is when did you take the medication? how much did you take becuase these all have a say if there is any harm to the fetus. in teratology there are three things you must have in order for the fetus to be harmed. 1. the drug must be a known teratogen 2. the dose must be high enough to cause harm 3. the timing must be correct- that period of organogenesis. accutane is the perfect drug that we know is harmful even at the human dose. it has all three characteristics. for you i don't have the exact answer. you should ask your physician to investigate. the real issue is you will find out soon enough when your baby is born. in all likelihood your baby will be just fine.	are ricola cough drops ok to take during pregnancy?

last year the obama administration issued new rules that prohibit group health-insurance plans — typically offered by employers — from restricting access to care by limiting mental-health benefits and requiring higher patient costs than those that apply to general medical or surgical benefits. the rules implement the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 (mhpaea). in other words the mhpaea states that a group health plan may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental-health benefits that are less favorable than any such limits imposed on medical surgical benefits. the affordable care act also takes steps to help people access the mental health services they need: right now if you haven’t been able to find health insurance due to a pre-existing mental-health condition you may be able to access the new pre-existing condition insurance plan. starting in 2014 substance abuse or mental illness can no longer be used by insurers to deny coverage as a “pre-existing condition” – and insurers also won’t be able to use those conditions to raise your premiums. also in 2014 mental-health and substance-use disorder services will be part of the essential benefits package a set of health-care service categories that must be covered by certain plans including all insurance policies that will be offered through the exchanges and most coverage in medicaid. these reforms all work to make the health-insurance marketplace a more accessible affordable place for people with mental-health and substance-abuse disorders.	under health-care reform when will there be fewer restrictions on mental-health sessions? . why is an insurance company allowed to limit how many therapy sessions a patient can have a year?

it is difficult to interpret the possible cause of the lesion detected in the mri without more medical history as well and complete mri visualization. possible causes that can present as lumps around the clavicle include - enlarged lymph nodes with or without abscess formation tumors like osteochondroma or it could also be a bony lump caused by a healing fracture of the clavicle. it would be best if you can consult the doctors treating you who can go through the mri and advice you accordingly. i hope this helps.	hi. my mum has had a lump just below her clavical/collarbone. she had an x-ray and the guy said he didn't know what it was but he didn't think it was cancerous just to come back for a check up in 6 months. fast forward a couple months my mom went to her gp and she ordered an mri. the results just came back and it said she has a hypo intense t1 and hyperintense stir involving the first anterior rib. a subtle abnormal enhancement of the rib was also identified. everything else in the area looked normal. they said she needs to go back for a ct scan. she just had a benign brain tumor removed and now she has to go through this it's very difficult. is this something that sounds like we should be concerned about? what could this possibly potentially be? thank you.
your doctor will probably prescribe several medicines after you have had a transient ischemic attack (tia). medicines to prevent blood clots are typically used because blood clots can cause tias and strokes. the types of medicines that prevent clotting are: antiplatelet medicines. anticoagulant medicines. cholesterol -lowering and blood pressure -lowering medicines are also used to prevent tias and strokes. antiplatelet medicines antiplatelets (such as aspirin aspirin with extended-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel ) keep platelets in the blood from sticking together. aspirin is most often used to prevent tias and strokes. many studies have shown that aspirin helps prevent strokes and reduces the risk of another tia in people who have had their first tia. other antiplatelet medicines (such as clopidogrel) may be used for people who cannot take aspirin or for whom aspirin has not been effective. aggrenox a medicine that combines aspirin with dipyridamole is a safe and effective alternative to aspirin to prevent tia and stroke for some people. 9 anticoagulants anticoagulants prevent the production of certain proteins that are needed for blood to clot. if you have atrial fibrillation you will probably take an anticoagulant (such as warfarin ). anticoagulants are more effective than antiplatelets in preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. 4 both anticoagulants and antiplatelets increase the risk of bleeding. warfarin (such as coumadin ) has the highest risk of bleeding problems but the risk is lower when the dosage is closely monitored. if you take warfarin don't suddenly change your intake of foods that are rich in vitamin k. vitamin k can interfere with the action of anticoagulants making it more likely that your blood will clot. for more information see: anticoagulants: vitamin k and your diet. cholesterol-lowering medicines experts recommend that most people who have had a tia take statins which lower cholesterol. many studies show that statins significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a tia. statins even protect against stroke in people who do not have heart disease or high cholesterol. 5 for more information on these medicines see the topic high cholesterol. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat transient ischemic attack tia?

you need to involve his medical provider if you are unclear as to the cause of the symptoms or their significance. for instance if a child has a history of asthma or pneumonia they need medical intervention sooner than a child who doesn't have this history. if your two-year old had flu vaccine this year he is less likely to get influenza; if not he may need to be seen early since influenza can be treated in the first two days. so his medical history plays a huge role as well as your comfort in dealing with his fever and cough. when in doubt seek medical help.	how do you know when to take a two year old in to doctors that has a fever and a cough? . he has had a fever all day ranging from 100. 2-103. 4 at its peak today. he also has a cough.

"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. osteomyelitis is no fun that's for sure! the only way you'll find out the answer to your question is to ask. somnolence (sleepiness) is one of the main side effects of opioid pain relievers like morphine and oxycodone. often the first treatment for excessive somnolence in opioid users is to reduce the dosage. if that's impossible in your case then your doctor may consider prescribing something to offset the drowsiness. if you're experiencing severe sleepiness due to opioid use you need to be extremely careful about driving cooking (for example using knives or a food processor) operating machinery or any tasks that require keen awareness. you also need to make sure you're not so highly medicated that your breathing slows or stops. regularly check your lips to make sure they don't have a bluish tint around the edges and make sure your finger nailbeds stay pink as well. if you see any bluishness around your mouth or in your nailbeds you should contact your doctor right away as these can be signs of an accidental opioid overdose. i just want to add that your pain should not keep you ""bedridden.

most helpful answer here are some tips on how to stay full longer: make sure you get plenty of fiber to meals. fiber is found in fruits vegetables and whole grains. beans are really high in fiber and make great additions to salads and are good as a side dish. protein is also very filling so include a source at each meal -- nut butters meat eggs beans (fiber and protein) and tofu are all good sources. fat is very satisfying and adds extra calories so make sure you have a fat source at each meal. that might be nuts on your oatmeal avocado on a salad or sandwich or olive oil when roasting veggies. healthy fats such as those from plants and fish are the best health wise. dairy and/or non-dairy alternatives are important as your calcium needs are high. try greek yogurt with nuts milk in your oatmeal and cheese in sandwiches and mixed dishes. the key is to add as many food groups as possible for satisfaction nutrition and to manage your hunger. for more ideas see this webmd article.	why am i always hungry? . i am a 17 year old girl and i'm always hungry. i primarily eat healthy. no soda or chips. i eat 3-5 full meals a day. i eat oatmeal fruit veggies and meat. i drink over 10 glasses of water a day. i don't gain weight. i am 5'8 and 130lb. i am physically active. why am i so hungry? what can i do to stay full longer?

if you have heart failure: be sure any exercise is paced and balanced with rest. avoid isometric exercises such as push-ups and sit-ups. isometric exercises involve straining muscles against other muscles or an immovable object. don't exercise outdoors when it is too cold hot or humid. high humidity may cause you to tire more quickly; extreme temperatures can interfere with circulation make breathing difficult and cause chest pain. better choices are indoor activities such as mall walking. make sure you stay hydrated. it is important to drink water even before you feel thirsty especially on hot days. but be careful not to drink too much water. follow your doctor's guidelines about how much fluid you can have in a day. extremely hot and cold showers or sauna baths should be avoided after exercise. these extreme temperatures increase the workload on the heart. steer clear of exercise in hilly areas. if you must walk in steep areas make sure you slow down when going uphill to avoid working too hard. monitor your heart rate closely. if your exercise program has been interrupted for a few days (for example due to illness vacation or bad weather) make sure you ease back into the routine. start with a reduced level of activity and gradually increase it until you are back where you started.	what are some general workout tips for people with heart failure?

the chance of an unintentional pregnancy is certainly less but not zero. while you may not be ovulating at that time sperm can remain viable inside the female reproductive tract for several days to a week. just loitering around waiting for an egg (ovum) to appear. don't do this again. if you are going to have sex either insist on your partner to use a condom 100% of the time or you need to be taking a more effective form of contraception. unprotected sex is not worth the worry and anxiety that it causes. be smart or you may eventually become pregnant. your body is designed for it.	i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend the day after my period can i be pregnant

it depends. if the patients are on the same exact plan then generally yes. but there are so many different types of insurance policies and doctors participate with some of them and not with others. what may look the same on the surface may actually be two different health insurance policies even if they're provided by the same insurer. and a physicians' panel can become full at which point he or she may stop taking new patients.	if doctor. accepts health insurance or medicare from one patient is he obligated to so for the other patients?
i have a better idea: stay home. there are a handful of causes of ear pain. an “ear infection” is infected fluid behind the eardrum in a space called the “middle ear. ” the medical term for this is “otitis media ” sometimes called “acute otitis media” to stress that it begins suddenly. acute otitis media almost always occurs after a child has had nasal congestion for a few days most typically from a cold. if your child complains of ear pain and hasn’t been congested it probably isn’t an ear infection. even if your child really does have an ear infection you don’t necessarily have to rush to have it checked. an antibiotic isn’t thefirst thing he needs. in fact it may not be necessary at all! so what should parents do about a weekend or middle-of-the-night earache? if the child looks miserable and sick he really should be seen right away. if the pain is more mild or moderate give him a dose of pain medicine like ibuprofen or have him hold a warm heating pad against the ear. if the pain subsides with these simple measures an emergency trip to the doctor or er is not necessary. what happens if you delay starting antibiotics for an ear infection? as long as the child isn’t super-miserable it’s ok to wait a bit. ear infections it turns out usually go away on their own. waiting a day or two if your child is reasonably comfortable is a good way to avoid extra costs hassle and antibiotics. note that this advice is meant for children older than two who can speak and describe what they’re feeling. if your child is younger you should call your doctor for more specific advice on whether you ought to wait a few days before being seen on the weekend.	it’s sunday and my 3 year old son has an earache. should i take him to the er or an urgent care clinic?
diphenhydramine is the generic name for the medicine found in benadryl. like most other antihistamines it often causes drowsiness. but it can have the opposite effect in some adults and in children. in these cases it stimulates the brain. this can cause trouble sleeping restlessness and in rare cases seizures. seizures are more likely to occur when the dose of diphenhydramine is too high as in the case of an overdose. there are however many other possible causes for seizures. this link will take you to a webmd article that talks about other causes of seizures. <link>	is there a connection between seizures and benadryl?

"keep it simple keep it practical keep it convenient keep it realistic keep it specific and don't try to make up for years of inactivity all at once. select any activity and amount of time where the probability of sticking with it is high. you may not love walking but if you can do it right outside your door and it requires no special equipment and you already know how to do it (you've been walking your entire life! ) then walking might be your best bet for getting started because it's so convenient. planning is helpful for behavior change and you should set goals each week. write down what day(s) of the week you'll exercise what time of day minutes of activity location and the activity that you'll do. be as specific and realistic as possible and remember that it's not how much you do when you get started but that you simply get started (getting started is usually the hardest part). a sample plan might look like this: monday: take a 20-minute brisk walk at 7 a. m. around the block four times. tuesday: do the same as on monday. wednesday: take a 20-minute walk at 6:30 p. m. (right before dinner) around the block. thursday: take the day off. friday: take a 20-minute walk at 7 a. m. around the block. saturday: walk with your family at 10 a. m. for 45 minutes in park. sunday: bike ride with your spouse for 60 minutes in park at noon. mom will baby-sit. keep records of your weekly progress by writing down what happens or at least checking off that you followed through and then setting your weekly plan every week for at least three months. then at three months you can evaluate your progress and see if any changes need to be made. also ask yourself at that time if you believe you will be exercising regularly in six more months. if the answer is ""i'm not sure "" or ""no "" then you ought to continue to set weekly goals. if you are confident that you can maintain the behavior and will be exercising in six months then you may not need to set weekly goals but at the fist sign of slipping you ought to go back to it."	how do i go about getting started with aerobic exercise?

although its an interesting theory it's not supported by science. lactose intolerance does not cause weight gain. excess weight occurs when you eat more calories than your body burns. in fact people with more serious gastrointestinal problems like ulcerative colitis or crohns have food rush through them and they tend to be underweight and sometimes malnourished. the body does not seem to overcompensate.	can lactose intolerance cause weight gain? if all my food rushes through could my body be overdoing calorie retention? . if all the food i eat constantly rushes through could my body be overcompensating and desperately trying to get calories out of food because it usually 'rushes' out? . i've timed my body before and high-lactose items last 15 minutes (until desperate release). this sounds like the gi may have to be in high gear just to try to absorb food. if it's in this gear when i don't have lactose i feel it may be a reason for weigh gain or retention.

hcv is spread (transmitted) most efficiently through inadvertent exposure to infected blood. the most common route of transmission is needles shared among users of illicit drugs. accidental needle-sticks in health care workers also have transmitted the virus. the average risk of getting hcv from a stick with a contaminated needle is 1. 8% (range 0% to 10%). prior to 1992 some people acquired the infection from transfusions of blood or blood products. since 1992 all blood products are screened for hcv and cases of hcv due to blood transfusion now are extremely rare. hcv also can be passed from mother to unborn child. approximately 4 of every 100 infants born to hcv-infected mothers become infected with the virus. a small number of cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse. the risk of transmission of hcv from an infected individual to a noninfected spouse or partner without the use of condoms over a lifetime has been estimated to be 1% to 4% finally there have been some outbreaks of hcv when instruments or sharp tools have been reused without appropriate cleaning between patients. transmission of hcv can be prevented in several ways. programs have been aimed at avoiding needle sharing among drug addicts. needle exchange programs and educational interventions have reduced high-risk behaviors. however drug addicts are a difficult population to reach and rates of hcv remain high among addicts (30% of younger users). among health-care workers safe needle-usage techniques have been developed to reduce accidental needle-sticks. newer syringes have self-capping needle systems that avoid the need to manually replace a cap after drawing blood and reduce the risk of needle-sticks. there is no clear way to prevent transmission of hcv from mother to child. persons with multiple sexual partners should use barrier precautions such as condoms to limit the risk of hcv as well as other sexually transmitted diseases. monogamous couples should consider the low risk of transmission when deciding whether to use condoms during intercourse. some couples may decide to use them and some may not. screening tests for blood products have almost eliminated the risk of transmission through transfusion estimated by the cdc to be less than one in two million transfused blood products. people with hcv should not share razors or toothbrushes with others. it is critical that physicians and clinics follow manufacturer's directions for sterilizing/cleaning instruments and that disposable sharp instruments be discarded properly. it is important to realize that hcv is not spread by casual contact. thus shaking hands kissing and hugging are not behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. there is no need to use special isolation procedures when dealing with infected patients.	how is hepatitis c virus spread and how can transmission be prevented?

snacks should be high in fiber and have important nutrients. foods like whole grains beans fruits and vegetables all contain fiber plus other nutrients. if you choose to have carbohydrates include foods that are lower on the glycemic index (for more information about the glycemic index go here ). examples of foods that are lower on the glycemic index are fruits vegetables whole grains beans and nuts. these kinds of foods won’t be absorbed into your blood steam as quickly so you will feel more satisfied. snacks should also contain small amounts of protein as these foods take longer to digest and supply more energy over a longer period of time. foods such as beans nuts seeds and soy products offer protein to balance the carbohydrate-rich foods if eaten together in as a snack. follow this link for some snack ideas.	how many carbs should be in a snack. how many carbs should a snack have

"exactly how much exercise is needed to lower cholesterol has been a matter of some debate. in general most public health organizations recommend at a minimum 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise such as walking jogging biking or gardening. but a 2002 study by researchers at duke university medical center found that more intense exercise is actually better than moderate exercise for lowering cholesterol. people who exercised vigorously also raised their levels of hdl -- the ""good"" kind of lipoprotein that helps clear cholesterol from the blood. ""we found it requires a good amount of high intensity exercise to significantly change hdl "" says william kraus md an assistant professor of medicine at duke and lead author on the study. even though moderate exercise was not as effective in reducing ldl -- the ""bad"" cholesterol -- or increasing hdl it did keep cholesterol levels from rising."	how much exercise does it take to lower cholesterol?

hepatitis c infection is the leading reason for liver transplantation in the u. s. accounting for 40% to 45% of transplants. hcv routinely recurs after transplantation and infects the new liver. approximately 25% of these patients with recurrent hepatitis will develop cirrhosis within five years of transplantation. despite these findings of recurrence the five-year survival rate for patients with hcv is comparable to that of patients who receive transplants for other types of liver disease. treatment for recurrent hepatitis is not a simple issue. interferon is an immune modulator (modifier) that may promote rejection of the transplanted liver. furthermore interferon may not be well tolerated by patients who just underwent transplantation and are taking many different kinds of medications.	can liver transplantation be done for hepatitis c?

this sounds just exactly like an issue that i dealt with for months in 2014. hubby and i went on vacation and on the last couple of days i was having an itch right at my waist line in the back. it wasn't too bad and i didn't think too much of it at the time. it would come and go. the day we got home it got worse. i looked in the mirror and there was a couple of spots each about the size of a quarter that looked like hives. i put an ice pack on it to relieve the itching and after half an hour or so it went away. over the course of about 2 months my nutritionist and i tried and tried to figure it out but it would just come and go several times a day. sometimes on my arms other times it was on my stomach or legs or back. very random. at times it would be circular in shape. other times it would show up as long lines or irregular shapes. definitely looked like hives though. then suddenly it just stopped. i realized one day that it had been a week and no new out breaks. it started on our vacation in august 2014 and ended sometime around november/december 2014. then just this past week it happened again. i noticed my arm pits itching a little one evening but again didn't think much of it. wasn't too bad just a little annoyance a couple times. the next morning i woke up to bright red pits and the same hive looking spots on my stomach. i started thinking about what was different during the time that i didn't have the hives. the only thing i could come up with was the while on our vacation last year we had lots of specialty coffee drinks from a famous coffee shop that i won't name here. i continued to have them several times a week until sometime in the fall don't remember when. just last weekend we decided to have them again a couple times that weekend. large ones. two days later the hives were back. that makes me sad but i guess maybe i need to lay off the expensive coffee drinks and just have my coffee here at home. it can be different things for different people but thought i would mention this just in case it might help someone else. i never thought at the time that my coffee drinks could be the problem (and it may just be a coincidence) but for now i think i'll avoid them.	i have a itchy rash that comes and goes what could be causing this? . the rash appears in different areas of my body for an example a rash showed up on my wrist and stayed a while and went away. later the same day it appeared on my stomach and then on my thighs etc. its itchy while it is present. at one point my hands first turned red and then start to itch really bad to the point i had to wash my hands repeatedly. i work in the medical field so i wash my hands a million times a day. what could be causing this reaction?

i thought i'd take this as an opportunity to review proper first aid for an individual suffering a seizure: during the seizure: don't hold the person down or try to stop his movements (unless necessary for his safety) time the seizure with your watch (if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes it may be appropriate to call for emergency help) clear the area around the person of anything hard or sharp put something soft and flat under their head turn patient gently to one side if possible do not try to force the mouth open. (a person having a seizure cannot swallow their tongue. ) once the seizure ends: roll the individual onto their side. attempt to clear airway of any saliva vomit or blood if possible check vital signs stay with patient until they demonstrate normal degree of alertness make sure all airways are clear and free of obstruction. talk to the patient in a calm and soothing manner (stroking hair is optional) assuring them that things are alright. stay with them until they regain normal alertness.	what is the proper first-aid treatment for someone having a seizure?

i think that they do work but they should be done with caution. if you have an underlying medical condition such as diabetes where you might be more prone to infection you have to be very careful using these products because a break in the skin can lead to infection and that can be very serious. so you have to be careful in how you use it and try not to go so far as to cause bleeding or a break in the skin. but used properly under the right circumstances they can be very effective at paring down the skin in a gentle way.	do those really work to get rid of calluses on the feet?

male fertility is compromised by excessive free radicals generation (oxidative stress). oxidative stress leads to defective spermatogenesis/sperm formation. the antioxidant spermatogenic herbs are ashwagandha (withania somnifera) amalaki (emblica officinalis) kapikacchu (mucuna pruriens) gokshur (tribulus terrestris). these herbs in addition restore balance in hypothalamus-pitutary-gonadal (h-p-g) axis which further improves spermatogenesis.	which is the best herbal solution for men's fertility enhancing? . the number of couples unable to conceive is gradually increasing and most of the cases are due to infertility in the male partner. according to traditional herbal literature this herb is an adaptogen? . this means that adaptogens are very effective in terms of overcoming stress as well as stress-induced reactions.

avoid getting active tb active tuberculosis (tb) is an infection that is spreading in a person's body and it is very contagious. the world health organization (who) estimates that one-third of the world's population is infected with the bacteria that causes tb. to avoid getting an active tb infection: do not spend long periods of time in stuffy enclosed rooms with anyone who has active tb until that person has been treated for at least 2 weeks. use protective measures such as face masks if you work in a facility that cares for people who have untreated tb. if you live with someone who has active tb help and encourage the person to follow treatment instructions. prevent latent tb from becoming active usually treatment with isoniazid for about 9 months or rifampin for 4 months can prevent a latent tb infection from developing into active tb. treatment is recommended for anyone with a skin test that shows a tb infection and is especially important for people who: are known to or are likely to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). have close contact with a person who has active tb. have a chest x-ray that suggests a tb infection and have not had a complete course of treatment. inject illegal drugs. have a medical condition or take medicines that weaken the immune system. have had a tuberculin skin test within the past 2 years that did not show a tb infection but now a new test indicates an infection. can the tb vaccine help? a tb vaccine ( bacille calmette-guerin or bcg) is used in many countries to prevent tb. but this vaccination is almost never used in the united states because: the risk of getting tb is low in the u. s. the vaccine is not effective in adults who receive it. the bcg vaccine may cause a tuberculin skin test to indicate a tb infection even if a person is not infected with tb. this complicates the use of the tuberculin skin test to check people for tb. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	how can tuberculosis tb be prevented?

every person is different when it comes to their clinical response from tamiflu. first the diagnosis must be accurate. if you had a rapid flu test that proved you have influenza then the tamiflu may help by reducing the symptoms and shortening the course of the illness. second tamiflu must be starting on day one or two otherwise it may not make much of a difference in your recovery time. i would expect a properly diagnosed person starting tamiflu on day one or two to be feeling better in about two days. that would assume of course that you are not developing a secondary infection.	how many doeses if taking two75mg of tamiflu a day will it take to start feeling better on average?

after an operation cardiologist and my doctor decided to put me under statines and cardioaspirine and i followed their prescriptions for one year since i noticed that i have muscular problems and strange troubles when i streched them. one time i had to stay in bed for 3 days without force like if it was a serious atack of flue. after i read that this was a side effect of statines i decided to stop and to change my life. one year after and 10kg less i just pass an exam and the cardiologist says to me that everything is perfect cholesterol is under the limit cardiogram and an effort test have been without any problem. the doctor says to me to continue absolutely with statines and cardioaspirine as i didn't say to him that i stop to take them since one year for me is a good sign. the results are obtained like this: with exercice and with a strict dieta. every morning from 7 to 9 i do exercices in a fitness center. one part with a group one part alone with all the machines. in one year i frequently arrive to make exercices that many young people can't and i'm like an exemple for that center as i am 70 years old. i only take a rest one time a week. about dieta i avoid all industrial food like cakes or pastries but also bread rice potatoes pastas and pizzas (especially in the evening) i only eat meat one time a week (frequently chicken with a glass of wine) the other days only fish and 4 o 5 different vegetables cooked in the oven. two to 4 meals a week with nuts and seeds of any kind. (15 different sorts in a very small quantity as together it can be 150 grams). i was never feeling so well and i'm still actifve in my company. frankly statines are the contrary of what we need as they provoke muscular problems and other different sicknesses and this can impeach you to make the exercice that you need. it's really a non-sense medication! you are becoming impotent and more sick instead of beeing better. when i heard that actually there is a campaign among doctors and medias to prescribe statines even for chieldren it's really like a crime. the level of cholesterol has been invented by doctors payed by the producers of statines and not by indipendent doctors. remember.	how do i safely stop taking simvastatin (10 mg)? . i do not nor have i ever had high blood pressure. my cholesterol count before simvastatin was 234. . a stress test 3 years ago showed that there are no blockages or build up in my arteries my heart is in good shape; as a matter of fact the cardiologist told me i had the heart of a thirty year old. after learning about the dangers of this drug i am scared and would like to discontinue it. please advise. .
there are several other reasons to be having nipple discharge besides pregnancy or breastfeeding. some of these can include: 1. elevated prolactin level (hormone that is elevated during breast feeding to make the milk) due to medications--there are medications which can raise the blood prolactin level which then causes milk production. the most common ones are anti-psychotics and other psychiatric meds. sometimes the older blood pressure medications or even very high levels of thc have been implicated. 2. pituitary adenoma--this is a benign growth inside the pituitary gland which stimulates the production of prolactin. the pituitary gland is where prolactin is always made. 3. estrogen--in some women estrogen (e. g. birth control pills) can increase milk production. 4. breast stimulation--if nipple play is a consistent part of sex it can raise prolactin levels just as a nursing baby can. 5. other type of breast discharge being mistaken for breast secretions/milk--this is more often the case if the milk is coming from just one breast or just a couple of ducts in the nipple. you really should see a gyn or your local county family planning clinic. they will do a blood test to measure prolactin level to see if it is elevated. if the problem is on one side only then a breast ultrasound or mammogram depending upon your age can be ordered. if indicated a ductogram may be needed if the discharge if from one duct only. if you are having a lot of milk you should get checked out.	i never breastfed my four children and i know i am not pregnant. so why would my breasts be producing milk?

the medical professional administering the injection draws up the corticosteroid into a syringe. a local anesthetic (such as lidocaine) may simultaneously be drawn into the syringe. next the area to be injected is selected. typically the skin over the area to be injected is sterilized with a liquid solution either alcohol or betadine. sometimes the area is topically anesthetized by rapid cooling using a spray such as ethyl chloride. the needle of the syringe then is inserted into the tissue to be injected and the solution is ejected from the syringe into the area of inflammation. the needle then is withdrawn and a sterile bandage is applied to the injection site.	how are cortisone injections of soft tissues given?
prostate cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor (growth) that consists of cells from the prostate gland. generally the tumor usually grows slowly and remains confined to the gland for many years. during this time the tumor produces little or no symptoms or outward signs (abnormalities on physical examination). however all prostate cancers do not behave similarly. some aggressive types of prostate cancer grow and spread more rapidly than others and can cause a significant shortening of life expectancy in men affected by them. a measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness is the gleason score which is calculated by a trained pathologist observing prostate biopsy specimens under the microscope. as the cancer advances however it can spread beyond the prostate into the surrounding tissues (local spread). moreover the cancer also can metastasize (spread even farther) throughout other areas of the body such as the bones lungs and liver. symptoms and signs therefore are more often associated with advanced prostate cancer.	what is prostate cancer?
no most antibiotics they give for strep are: ammoxicilian ammoxicilian clavulanate(augmentin brand name) cephalexin or (keflex brand name). never heard of the drug you are speaking of. i know you don't have insurance but think of your health i recently thought i was having an ear infection so went to doctor but did not want to pay high medical bill so went to clinic inside walgreens and turns out it was only a skin infection of the outer ear. was given cephalexin for 10 days since i can only take liquid meds have troubles taking pills. i have insurance and ended up only paying $20 for the visit and $5 for the meds. you should try take care clinic at walgreens or minute-clinic at cvs their prices seem to be very reasonable. without insurance my visit would have been only $89.	ok so i have strep throat and i have a full perscription of non expired ciprofloxacin can i use that to treat strep? . i had a sinus infection a little while back and the doctor gave me ciprofloxacin for it. i never ended up taking it i just trooped through it and let it resolve itself as i have a fairly effective immune system. i know you are going to tell me to go to the doctor and have him look at it but i know for a fact i have strep i have had it before and i know how it looks and feels. im living on my own at 18 and i dont have the insurance to pay for a docvisit/antibiotics so can i treat it with cipro?

the development of scar tissue is how our bodies respond to a breach in our skin as when your cat's claw pierced the skin of your upper lip. unfortunately scar tissue is not skin tissue and does not look the same or feel the same. with time most scar tissue recedes in size and the pink color will turn more white making it less noticeable. one thing you might try is very gently rubbing a little vitamin e-based oil or cream over the area with the scar to help with the healing process and to diminish the appearance of the scar. if it really is a problem you'll want to talk to a plastic surgeon about your options.	my cat's claw got stuck in my upper lip and caused an infection. how can i get rid of the round pinkish scar?

my advice would to buy another test if you don't start soon. sometimes you can get a false negative when you take an otc test. even if it's still negative you should go see your ob to be on the safe side. when i was pregnant with my daughter i took 4 test and they all came back negative. i went to see my ob and found out i was 9 weeks pregnant. my ob told me that some of the meds i was on were what was causing the test to come back negative. so it's worth a trip to the ob to be on the safe side if you don't start soon.	im worried i might be pregnant i was only spotting yesterday and then it stopped i took a test and it was negative

if you think it is a decay that has started in your teeth i would like you to go to your nearby dentist and get it confirmed. if it is decay then your dentist might suggest you to get some dental fillings done. if it is just stains that you are noticing then the stains could be removed by dental scaling that is cleaning. decay can be formed due to lots of food impaction in the back tooth regions which is a very common complaint. sometimes even though we are good in brushing there are areas where the brush cannot reach. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,There is a tooth decay started in my all teeth on lower backside.

if prevacid was the drug prescribed for your reflux/heartburn and it was helping your symptoms you shouldn't stop unless advised by your doctor. since calcium citrate (as in citracal) doesn't require acid in the stomach for absorption this is your supplement of choice. tums are made from calcium carbonate as is caltrate; they may not be totally absorbed while on an acid-reducing medication. the current standard recommendation for daily calcium intake is 1200 mg every day. remember that this number includes calcium from food. most people who eat a well-balanced diet get about 300 mg of calcium without even trying! if you include dairy products or calcium-fortified foods in your daily diet you can reduce or even eliminate the amount needed from supplements. to help estimate your daily calcium intake contact nof [national osteoporosis foundation] and request a calcium-calculator handout. note: you shouldn't take your prevacid and calcium supplements together. check with your doctor about the appropriate timing of the medication in relationship to your calcium citrate. vitamin d3 comes in several strengths over-the-counter so you should easily be able to find the amount you need.	i have osteopenia. i take prevacid and my doctor recommended 1500 mg of calcium daily. should i take them together?

most helpful answer yes you should go to the hospital. the content and tone of your question indicates that you are suffering greatly. it sounds like you've stopped medication so that your many physical and emotional symptoms will absolutely continue and may even worsen. you probably need to be in a hospital setting where your behavior can be monitored and an effective medication regime begun. close medical staff observation medication stabilization eating nutritious meals obtaining some peaceful rest and talk therapy are the necessary ingredients to regaining normalcy in your life.	do i need to go to the hospital for major depression lasting longer than 2 months?

milia also known as whiteheads are very common white pimples that can occur in persons of all ages. they appear mostly on the upper cheeks nose and chin of infants. this occurs when dead skin cells and sebaceous matter gets trapped near the skin surface rather than exfoliating naturally. common causes of milia include the use of thick and heavy cosmetics or poor-quality products that are not suitable for the skin that prevent the sloughing-off of dead skin cells. excessive sun exposure makes the skin thick which leaves it unable to exfoliate naturally.	what causes milia? how can i avoid getting these?

any woman having sex without any form of contraception is capable of becoming pregnant assuming their male partner has viable sperm (and of course you are ovulating). a small amount of spotting 24 hours after sexual activity in no way means you are pregnant. this spotting could simply be minor trauma to your very sensitive and vascular tissue. if you have been trying to get pregnant wait until you miss your period and take a home pregnancy test. if the spotting does not subside you will need to consult your medical provider.	dpotting after sex. i was ovulating yesterday and hed sex with my husband. during the course of the day i feld slight cramping around my lower abdomen. tonight 24hours later i notice some spotting. its n brownish color. can i be pregnant?
this is a very good question because it shows that in pain management the therapy has to be patient-specific. both sandoz and mylan make generic versions of the duragesic patch. they both contain the same active ingredient but the way the medication is released through the patch may be different and it also depends upon your skin and how it absorbs medications. in cases like this i always talk to my patients to see what brand works better for them. i would suggest talking to your pharmacist and let them know that you have better results with the sandoz brand and would prefer to receive that brand in the future. this is a great example of something that you can talk to you pharmacist about. it is important that your pain is managed properly and if this helps in that cause it is an easy fix. hello when the doctor first put me on the fentanyl patch i tried many brands from the pharmacy. couple would not stick one actually was clear and you could see the gel/medicine in the actual patch etc. after trying many brands i found mylan was the 100% best kind. hope this helps. ty.	i used sandoz brand fentanyl patches and they worked well. my pharmacy switched me to mylan. is there a preferred brand? . they appear to be totally different looking -- you cannot see the liquid medication inside as you could with the sandoz. when i put the sandoz brand on i could immediately feel a rush and a funny taste in my mouth they began to work in about 45 minutes and the mylan don't seem to work as fast. is there a difference in brands? both were 75 mcg/h. i have been using the patches for about eight weeks.

everyone's at risk but those at greater risk are infants young children pregnant women and their unborn babies older adults and people with weakened immune systems (for example those with hiv/aids cancer diabetes kidney disease and transplant patients). some people may become ill after ingesting only a few harmful bacteria. others may remain symptom-free after ingesting thousands. to prevent food-borne illness keep these key actions in mind: wash your hands. keep raw meats and ready-to-eat foods -- like salads -- separated during preparation. cook foods to the proper temperature by using a food thermometer. refrigerate foods promptly and reheat leftovers to 165 degrees fahrenheit.	i read that pregnant women are at greater risk for food-borne illness. what can i do to protect myself and my baby?
if the eel was fumigated maybe that's causing a bit of an issue. honestly your case of the nerves over being forced to eat something is likely to be the main cause of this especially if they are not having diarrhea. or you could have gotten it from some other issue that's happening at the same time. sushi and sashimi have to be prepared under some pretty high standards in most cases i'd trust it more than a regular hamburger.	diarrhea worried about anisakis. yesterday i went to an asian restaurant and my friends basically forced me into eating eel sushi roll i think it was fumigated due to the color and taste but i think it was raw. now this morning i got diarrhea and i'm burping a lot (sorry if i was so explicit but couldn't put that in any other way) and got a little bit of gastric acidity. now i don't think i have nausea i have a weird feel but it's probably because i'm stressing about it and i am a hypochondriac so it could be related to that.
there is no stronger over-the-counter medication for headache or migraine pain relief. headaches are very individualized. there are several over-the-counter medications you can use to alleviate painful headaches. these medications include acetaminophen (tylenol) an effective over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) medication. this medication can help with achy pain stiffness and fever. however it does not have any anti-inflammatory properties. this is important for some types of headache relief. in addition the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug class (nsaids) consists of products like ibuprofen (motrin advil) and naproxen (naprosyn aleve) which work by exhibiting analgesic relief antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. lastly combination products such as excedrin migraine contain acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. these ingredients combined make a more powerful headache/pain reliever than the ingredients separated out alone. it is important to follow the instructions on the label of over the counter medication and not to mix products in order to prevent overdosing or toxicity. monitor the frequency and intensity of your migraines to know when it is time to seek professional help and possibly the addition of a prescription medication. if you're 18 or older advil migrane and excedrin migrane are really good. i don't know about all around pain relievers. advile migrane is a gel so it is easy to swallow and fast-acting it also lasts all day. excedrin migrane is supposedly the safest and #1 nuerologist reccomended migrane medicine. also if you're not talking about a migrane just a really bad headache please don't take these because these are really strong drugs and can hurt you if they are in your system fro no reason.	what is the strongest over-the-counter headache/pain reliever medicine?

exercise has no effect on hiatal hernias. exercise however can increase acid reflux in people who are prone to acid reflux presumably those individuals with weak lower esophageal sphincter muscles. exercise increases intra-abdominal pressure and can force stomach acid back into the esophagus through a weak lower esophageal sphincter. the effects of alcohol and tobacco on the effectiveness of protonix or related drugs (proton pump inhibitors or ppis) are minimal. however both alcohol and tobacco aggravate the underlying acid-related conditions for which protonix is used and they should be discouraged.	can exercise help with a hiatal hernia and do alcohol or tobacco have any effect on (pantoprazole) protonix?

scoliosis typically does not progress or change after you stopped growing. mild scoliosis does not require treatment but there are dozen and dozens of causes of back pain. your first step is to see that specialist -- one who treats back problems like a neurosurgeon -- to see if there is a discoverable cause. if your symptoms are caused by bad posture poor ergonomics at work etc. then special exercises can help.	scoliosis. should i be concerned with changes? . i'm 26 never seen a specialist but was diagnose with the disorder when i was 12. i now have bad posture and pulling my head forward kills me. should i be concerned?
that would depend on the type of pneumonia namely the organism that is causing it. for instance if you had a viral pneumonia no antibiotic would be effective. if you had a lab-proven staphylococcal pneumonia perhaps your doctor will consider using clindamycin. there are no cookbook treatments for pneumonia. a decision on that type of antibiotic used for a particular pneumonia is determined by your medical provider based on examination findings. x-ray results blood test results etc. if you are self-diagnosing and self-treating with some clindamycin that you have it home i would not recommend it.	is clindamycin effective for pneumonia. for adults?
