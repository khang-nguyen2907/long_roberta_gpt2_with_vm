1	In any case, “it is not literature, but the punishment of the prisoner,” at least every one of himself (not everyone) has his own basement, hidden and deep, sometimes hysteric, and then obscurant; rational and regular, but my independence and free will are given greater priority, so that human beings are often ungrateful, creating and destroying, but fearing that there is no way to go; ideas and the mask of civilization cannot be torn apart; materialist, rationalist and classical hero, or nihilist, and what is best for well-being, which is always the problem of the conscious; conscious, rational, even more insane, consciousness is more like a river that moves, which is often difficult to understand, but which is difficult to control; self-esteem and self-esteem, satisfaction, which is often met with the satisfaction and control of the humiliation and injury, each of which has the power of being “stuffed”.
1	It's the first time I've experienced extreme simplicity in words.
1	Levy's book.
1	History of logical structures
0	It's kind of a boring book. It's kind of boring to keep writing novels like this.
0	A woman writer writes nine stinks. This one's stinky and long.
0	I can't read it. It's boring.
0	The stench of “humans above all other animals” and “why not eat meat?” It must be true to say that as a scientist, if he does not know that statistics are somewhat deceptive, this intelligence should not claim to be a scientist, and if he knows but deliberately uses them.
1	Magnificent. Exhilarating economic history. Very well translated.
1	It's a good textbook series.
1	I'd like to see a few more Woody movies after reading them.
0	It's so boring to know if it's the failure of the original author or the failure of the translation...............................................................................................................
0	"""She wanted to spit out something brilliant. A thousand horns of stars."" ""I don't understand why Les Pecdowno had God sealed, except for a few good sentences."
0	Why do you start with the first person in chapter two? It's annoying to look at.
0	I need to re-examine my IQ. Yes, I admit I read the novel, but I can't afford to fall into the middle of this.
1	It's a lot easier to read.
1	It's written by a foreigner.
1	The author doesn't nag. The translation is smooth. Post-recording is the key.
0	Why don't you make a good movie?
1	More of these, we'll see more clearly what science fiction is: first of all, fiction, and second, science fiction. Unfortunately, it's the age of the science students, and they don't value it.
0	Or is Africa more attractive to me under 30 cents?
0	"It's all over again. It's hard to see. See the words of Bean-Friends: ""Fifty Africans are missing from Bishop-Sook-Ming's trip to Africa."""
0	Or do you think I'm the one who didn't die in India?
1	It's actually a good translation, but I'm sorry I didn't read the original. The good stuff is taken off, and I look forward to his next one.
0	"The author must have had a calendar and a roster, a complete history of personal events, more character than the ""100 Houses"" as evidence, and the figure's age of bugs is less than the Red House dream, describing a certain month of events, but it's not the reason for history to say that it's a good novel. I don't think Mary Sue is a fatal wound, but the point is that she can't look at it as a child."
0	I'm trying to finish it.
0	It's not working.
1	That's how you feel about economics.
1	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1	Feels good.
0	You can't take pictures like that. How dare you pay for books?
0	The product of the campaign. The main part is a general one: the rapid development of information technology can lead to changes in the world economy, business practices and rules.
0	I read it in the afternoon when I was sitting in the store and back up the data, and I read about the 18-inch screen with the apple notebook, the Rolls-Royce in the notebook, the fact that the notebook was broken, and all of a sudden I looked up and cried at T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T.
0	I'm old and I'm old and I'm old and I'm old and I'm old and I'm old and I'm old.
0	(b) Word error;
0	Not really. It doesn't make any sense.
1	To buy a book, read it again.
1	In fact, the translation is a little off-the-shelf, and the first half of the script is a foreign standard, and there is a clear gap between how to write the script and some of the great theatrical scripts. But this length and depth of content can be considered as a good script entry.
0	Get the fuck out of here.
1	It's the first novel I've ever read by a writer from the Mainland. It's amazing. Love!
0	Why do you have to torture yourself with a short life to see uninflicted words? Laugh and cry and cry. Besides, sparkling is no longer my age.
1	That's a pretty good movie review. That's what the movie looks like. That's what I'm talking about.
1	It's a textbook.
1	"10:10 pm of 2012.4.19, finished reading the last line of 2666. ""Soon, he walked out of the park. The next day he went to Mexico."" The story could actually go back to the first part of 800 pages, and the four followed the literary commentators who went to Mexico with Achenboldi. A month with a thick, safe 2666, the horrible oasis of Santa Teresa in the desert, and I didn't want to leave. All the comments were in my reading notes."
0	It's an interesting idea, but it's not very good pen, it's a character profile, it's crafty.
0	The focus is on entertainment stars and so on. History is small and repeats the first. It's crude!
1	October
1	Collecting my handshake (and collecting it all in such a way) although Gilmore's fantasy movies are not right with me, it's enviable when directors have access to so many interesting things; the notes are even better than the movies themselves; everyone has a deserted mountain in their hearts waiting to be finished.
1	The creation of the Seven Samurai by the Romans of Life was truly addictive and amazing. The power of Hashimoto was evident from the preparation of the book, as well as from the scene. And from the perspective of his playwright, he was unique in evaluating the late work of Kurosawa Ming.
0	The whole process is called nausea!
0	It's bad. Quindra doesn't know poets.
1	That's great. I've studied.
0	I think it's the worst book ever. Although the scripts are clearly fine, the story layout and so on is on a scale. But that's why it's mature, making the narrative of the book too slow, but it's not nuanced. It's a lot of commercial things. Emotions are just the same. I wonder if Sin is reading Durala when he writes it. How does it become a “promotion to far away”? I don't like the characters in the story, either of men or women, a paranoid reality, or a paranoid ideal.
1	Very, very good books. It's even worth collecting.
1	The first one-third is better, and it's the earliest part. The last two-thirds repeats more, more in '08, and the interesting thing is that, up to 12 years, fission is better or the miracle is better, and it doesn't seem to be the weather, and the bosses find the road confident.
0	It's a good front.
0	It's an attractive topic, but it's too emotional. And it seems so boring and boring.
1	1. When the financial investment environment deteriorates, human panic destroys everything.
1	It's a dream, isn't it?
0	The author starts by saying that there's nothing wrong with a woman who looks like a master, and that the lead man is so unattractive... that the lead actress's love for a leading actor is all a game of wonders, just like the photographers who fall in love with themselves, and the human scholars who fall in love with their subjects. Both Twentine and Mu Jin like to write about feelings that start with desire, and probably feel that it's closer to the nature of love -- first of all, that two bodies are irresistible to each other. But Twentine is more acceptable to me than Mu-jing.
1	It's a long time ago. It's very easy to read. It's very interesting to think of a lot of exaggerating, insinuating and mocking reality.
1	It's a simple word about basic compilation techniques.
1	100 techniques that give people the basic idea of making a movie. When will they make their first film, The Green Tea Killer?
1	It's a bit of an infamous mind to satisfy my snooping-false-false-dreathing.
1	You don't have to think too much.
1	It's always been the choice that shapes us. It's the curse that comes with all the knowledge and all the power to choose the true information that needs to be done, and then forget it.
0	There are too many people who recommend this classic painting, especially punctuation. Fifi looks at it and says it's not for children, it's for adults, and I see it, and I don't understand it either. The first Central Europe and the fifth Spain, but the library has no guidebook, and neither Central Europe nor Spain knows much about it, and it's hard to understand how to express and express it. It's hard to say that adults can't read a script. Indeed, I don't like it. I don't like it.
0	The boar's a bit of a piece of shit. I'm sorry. I'm a purveyor.
0	It's a bit of a mess.
0	"For so many years, Zhang Qing has not made any progress, nor has it been the pattern and tone of ""The Fairy has gone on a carp,"" with a lot of long narratives, talk, talk, narcissism, and narcissism. Multi-view first-person narratives have been worn out, and instead of being new, they have created a discomfort and a terrible reading experience for reading. The whole story of ""My father, my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother"" came out of the ""My father, my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother"" in a very low-level way. Not a story goes into a grand historical background, and it's a good story of historical events such as literature, the dissolution of the former Soviet Union."
0	She's too unconscionable and unconscionable.
1	It's amazing.
1	The pulse is very clear. I've been thinking about the possibility that from the source and from the very roots, it is in the service of greater centralism, but it is a treasure (more power and wealth concentration and nationalism) and a trap (invigorated, sustainable development is blocked, kings are doomed).
0	The score is so high that it's impossible not to look. It's impossible to swallow.
1	But why can't you see what he's saying in a place like the Tiannancho district?
0	It's high-end black, isn't it?
1	Israel was born into so much suffering.
0	Can't you just talk a little bit...
0	It's about a third of history's nostalgia. Ms. Chen recommended it.
0	I don't like what the author wrote. I don't know if it's just because she's having problems communicating with people abroad or something. Every book says how to find a hotel.
0	It's a good writing. It's abandoned.
0	The book can be written a little more soulful. The result is a stream of water.
1	Literary makes us aware of our own deprivations and of what is already in life that has weakened us and that is making us breathe. Literary makes us understand that it is not easy to live like one.
1	The movie is the way I'm close to being free.
1	Woody Allen is no doubt a charismatic film master, a dialogue that allows fans to gain a deeper understanding of his personal thoughts and of what's behind the scenes. While public opinion has a lot to say about Woody’s personal life, through Woody’s patient, more straightforward and professional answers to the question, I think Woody is definitely an artist with a full and accurate understanding of himself and life. I admire his uniqueness in his work, self-discipline in life, and aesthetics.
0	Where the hell is it?
0	It's hard to understand. You're blind and tired. It's a mess to translate.
1	It's someone else's diary. It's very filmy.
0	An overrated book!
0	Just give the two stars a frame design.
1	I don't know what I'm talking about. Was it a trick to give the five stars back then? I really forgot.
1	It's always in my head that Chen Bo-yun is acting like he is.
0	Psst.
0	It's good for everyone to say it's good for you to see a little bit of it every day and it's hard for you to remember the name of the Snowman to look at the first chapters and keep looking at them. I'm in the middle of this book, or I'm in the middle, or I'm in the middle and I'm in the middle and I'm out of the first half of it, but it's down and it's gone.
0	The fog that began to look at is a memory of millions of layers of memory. The woman who made it, the man who made it, was stupid. The older brother of the woman who first looked at it was a bad face, and he was a man who loved the woman.
0	Never seen a translator like this, the TMD is the level of computer-translator software, and this is the first time I've regretted buying a book since I bought it online and advised you not to buy it, and Liang did recommend the book. It's probably in English.
1	Of course, the book is not systematic, and the overall picture of the re-engineering of the town is weak. In particular, the very key towns of Hedong, Zhao Yi, and Nishikawa have not been addressed, and it is hoped that it will soon be repeated.
1	It's probably just a good review by Easy and used to write it.
0	"It's a bad dad, and another prenuptial sex, an open ending, and a very drunk one... the story tells you: ""Don't hysteria a woman who's soft with someone's hands, a man who's desperate for the consequences."" Thinks that happiness comes to you as your hormonal chamber. Poverty is a string of thunders, and it turns out to be a waste of time. It can only be described, it can't be solved, it's misjudged."
1	The film does not bring us the only, the only, the only world, but many, not just a reality, but a lot of reality.
0	It's too fast to pretend to be alive and alive to grow out of a weak and unruly young lady as a business genius and to single out the pirates. It's too fast. It's too bug.
0	Expectations are too high, the funny word is bad. A short one is a real one, and a long one makes life feel like it.
0	It's good for blogs. The superficial, scattered content does not analyse the problem, it just asks the question, and it's not new. Sometimes it shows a sense of superiority on the part of the elite.
1	2666 has allowed Bolaño to dissipate almost all contemporary writers from far away and to be part of a long novel redefinition of long novels.
1	The new theory of the country's history is like ink painting, bones are clear, details are covered in a few sketches.
1	Several authors recounted the past and present life of zombies and its growing influence today.
1	The first of 12 cases is the Chinese stock market in June 2015.
1	That's a lot of bullshit.
0	Shit, the world's full of mediocres. Everyone else is a pig?
1	It's not finished. Read the first four chapters. It's still at the level of passive information-gathering. Buy it when it's made available.
0	Rather than a biography, it is a search for a return to history. From a historical point of view, questions such as the name of Willow, his relationship with Wu Gang and his relationship with filial clouds, visits to half a field hall, and the revival movement are discussed.
0	Oh, shit.
0	Rayshi me. It's a mess, Mary Sue.
1	It's just mechanical. In order to understand it, you have to go to his movies and try to smell it against the books.
0	The raiders are out of the market.
0	The subject is deep enough, but it's too thin, uncle. Let's get this straight.
0	It's such a beautiful title. It's such a sb story.
1	The movie is for real.
0	It's just that everyone likes women masters. When they're ugly, who says face is the first impression? And the continent is a mess. Not like a man who has no heart, not a man who can live if he dies. I still like me.
1	1 History of Geographical Decision
1	That's interesting!
1	It's too much love between the twins.
0	A book that apparently bought bean petals and Amazons wanted to find a book dedicated to the Silk Road, and it paid a lot of money to buy it. Not only was there no strictness on the part of the scholars, but there was also a odious Western perspective — the Persians were “the most selfish and arrogant people in the world” — and I would have endured it if you had also quoted Persians’ own literature.
0	You write better in junior high school.
1	Crazy, a little envious.
1	Bad enough, at least bold enough.
1	Films are no more than a hundred years old, but they have a large number of characters, a variety of styles, and the associated technology is rapidly evolving. It is not easy to do a complete combing. This book has a clearer line and, at the same time, has its own observations. It is useful to understand the history of film development, but it needs to be patient enough to read it. PS: Beijing University Press has a lot of errors in the first edition, and proof checks are inadequate.
0	It's not as interesting as it's supposed to be.
0	If it works, sociology must become pseudoscience.
0	I really don't know why anyone thinks this book looks good. Before I saw it, I thought it was good. I wanted to say what shit it says. Are these nice people the ones the authors asked for help?
0	P
1	And the big CEOs on Wall Street don't look much better than I do, and they're just like the Feds. The funniest thing is to get instructions from the boss to call someone who doesn't give a shit about you.
1	That's funny.
0	Photography is really about the level of friends, and the author's position is correct.
0	Full of crap, making the Qingjins struggle for the most inexhaustible reading book in the masturbating mud, -250 points.
1	It's a copy. It's a bad headache.
0	Is it true that I'm going to throw up my blood when I see chapter V, or I'm going to spit it out, or I'm going to throw it up, Nima, or I'm going to do anything, except that you're not going to do it? Is there anything in the opening of a story about a rich, handsome, entangled woman? Is there anything in life that happens when I kiss, tangle, tangle, Nima? Erm, I don't like the girl, what's the big deal? What's so sad about that? What's the other thing?
0	There is a feeling that the head of the woman's house is a bit of a mystery, that she is the one who didn't ask her before, and that she has not told her the truth about herself and her family, so there's nothing to be surprised about the owner's identity as a shareholder. There's something wrong with her. And, in any case, it's a domestic matter. There's no need to be out there.
0	One word comment: Not good!
1	I made half a book of fools.
0	Buying this book is a complete brain attack. It hurts my money.
1	"Professor Kuo Jung-min, a leading international expert in history, has a strong academic background, and many books have been rewritten and printed after China’s publication, representing ""The Confusion of Joo"" as a classic of learning about the past. Professor Kuo Jung-min is also leading this Harvard-China history collection, and has done volume 5 on his own, and has received the attention of the Ming History community. It is worth reading."
1	It's a little expensive to watch.
1	Deep and shallow, it's very beneficial.
0	P
0	I've ruined such a good title.
1	I finished reading yesterday, La La.
1	Backup
0	Sometimes you just need to know what an economist is, there is no need to read a book that he has written, such as the author of this book, the Austrian School of Economics, and I fear that the best way to reflect it is for him to use a book as an example of what one can say in a single sentence, which is irrelevant to its own appropriateness.
1	The more you know, the more you get in this book. Sometimes when you run into blind spots, you envy La.
0	I can't read it. I've been to Jerusalem, especially in Tower.
0	I'm not happy with this nuance of reality when I'm in pain.
1	A sharp cut artist.
1	Should we take a walk with our hands?
0	♪ Again ♪
1	It's beautiful! I've studied Chinese literature again, and I hope it's all over again. The charm of this book is that it's like the history of literature and poetry that outlines the story and opens up a world of amazing surprises beyond what we know. Five stars are unquestionable.
1	I didn't know my old man was so funny and so proud, so real.
0	Cheap.
0	It's overpacked.
0	There's no dry stuff, but it's about teaching people to start their own direct sales.
1	It's good. It's simple. It's hymn. 20150528.
1	Abstinence.
1	It's quite brilliant.
1	"To read Kurosawa Ming and his team from the point of view of its creation. Even without scripts such as Hashimoto and his ""Loseman"", he could be a world-class master, but maybe that's another."
1	That's it. It's worth a look at.
1	Learn how to do it.
1	It's worth it.
1	Why don't you watch the movie?
0	Garbage. Boring triangle.
0	Don't buy books like this anymore.
0	Ten minutes later, there are three stars in the photo and I'll give you zero points. Can't a girl in Taiwan write Chinese?
1	Some of the bee's got a heartache.
1	Uh, how's it going? Shut up.
0	That's funny.
0	What's that? It's colored. It's normal. It's sleepy.
0	It is unfortunate to have read and flipped, and to let go: Mr. Han In-yun, Mr. Kim Woo-choon, the same second-rate civilian, the same paranoia, enticement and tenderness, a self-inflicted kid hiding behind his back and laughing for the world; one who turns back to his old self-esteem and gets popular with the world of commentary. At times, the Huang Pu River ship is cold and cold.
1	The collapse of the Soviet Union was indeed a very important event, and the causes of its disintegration were manifold. The book speaks of many things that helped to understand Mr. Lin Lin, who was behind the scenes of the day, and strongly recommended it.
1	More helpless and desperate than Freedom.
1	Golf.
1	It's a rare piece of reading experience in the short classic series, which should be said to be younger, lighter, and better read than the heavy realisms of Ishigami after the rain. Not every one is long, but mostly depicts the minute the upper lady's troubles are broken. The characters are lonely and sober.
0	Imitation marks are heavy and, more importantly, content boring.
0	Well, what's different from the Wesley series.
1	We are the blind who can see, and we can see, and we cannot see.
0	No one wants to see a little girl's struggle history.
0	Growing up, this kind of love isn't real, so it's not getting high, and the author's long overdue, and my expectations are running out.
0	It's too long, it's not a script, it's not until it's streamlined. The woman in the second half is really a pain in the ass.
0	Why did I read this book in the first place?
0	I remember, I was basically reading books. I was wasting my time.
1	The fluorescent light on the cover is blind, and the thin green on the inner shell is pretty good.
0	Can you get out of a book world like this?
0	It's too trivial. It's a very elaborate movie.
1	The birth of a nation.
1	Three months back and forth.
1	Is it customary to hear all kinds of romantic optimism, and the pessimist view may be closer to the cruel reality?
0	It's so thin that it doesn't feel like the author's working on the text, it tastes like chewing wax, it doesn't tell the story well, it's a bit of deliberate peddling and it's even embarrassing.
0	Words are so pretentious that they are full of indoctrinations and indoctrinations, and only when it comes to hotels can I bring up a little bit of interest, only for Mark, and the other ways are different.
1	Four stars.
1	If you're looking at this as a professional theory book, then maybe 550 pages is not necessary.
1	Touch.
0	"It's just that you're here, and I'm there. So it's hard for me to think that the woman and the man will end up together in the second half. I don't always like to see the abuse of each other, but I really hate the man, which seems to be the first time I've hated the man. The last thing I've said is: ""MLGB"""
1	And when we think about what's dark and bright, we tend to fall into the foolishness of shape. In a criminal psychology book, you can see that complex people need external simplicity to balance; on the contrary, simple people need complex decorations to fill them up. For the subject, I think it also applies: the demand for this is natural, even more typical in music, yes, and I like dark things. These things can feel more powerful, as if they could be captured at the end of the day. Torsi's basement handwriting is certainly such an excellent food. In this book, you can see the mind of Tossi, which is reflected in his other works, like an overview of his later peak works, more like a message of religious torture of the soul.
0	I've given up. Hold on twice. I can't watch.
1	It's an interesting small country.
0	The book is a piece of work, followed by a simple list of historical facts, with little logic, lack of in-depth analysis and relevance, and little use.
1	The Prince wrote very interestingly about the fight in the court.
0	Record
0	The novel was a failure, but the paper attached to it was well written by Dazeji.
0	I can't read it. I can't read it. I can't read it.
0	A deep revelation of darkness was sold, with the result that only social journalism was mixed up.
0	The fact that the first half is barely justified is not clear on the relationship between the surging of monetary prices and the weakening of people's capacity to consume.
1	Four and a half stars.
1	Likes a person. It's probably the hottest thing when you don't know her. It's the purest thing.
1	This dream, I'm going to do it a little more. Montage my story.
0	One star, no more.
1	I can only groan at the masters of Forsythe, Hussy and so on...
1	It's a history book. It's worth reading.
1	IQs aren't good enough.
0	Not very complete.
1	This is not a book that is easy to read, it should be long overdue, and the rush of reading has been slowed down by a hard-on habit. It suddenly returns to the reading after the end of the journey, realizing that it has jumped over the facts. After two weeks at home, the book has been read.
1	You fight, you change, you laugh at the losers of your mouth. Ha-ha, you're such a wuss. Why the fuck are you rolling around in the dirt with us, the usuals?
1	I love a book that won't let go. Pick it up and put it down!
1	Despite all the praises, at the end of the day, I saw the more pertinent view of Tan's family... and I liked it more than anything else...
1	Nice tool book.
0	To tell you the truth, it doesn't feel like a historian, and of course, the author may not have classified himself as a historian, full of copper stench and gossip, presumably half a space with fried rice, and he's got a terrible, hasty way of writing it.
1	It's an interesting history.
0	You can publish books like this, and I'm drunk, too.
1	Actually, the book should be called French film culture history.
1	The first time I wrote a review, a good book, took a week to read all three of them, Chen Cuckoo, Forsythe, Mae Min Qi, Li Chi and so on, and there's no other love story.
1	May serve as a reference for “The History of Folklore Cultural Development in the South of China”, with special emphasis on Chapter V.
1	The perspective of volume V is worth five points.
0	It's good at first. But you can't see the light, the purity, the courage. It's all trimming, but it's only trimming.
1	The most difficult part of the trilogy.
1	It's all good.
0	Seeing the preamble as an ice-written premonition, it is clear that Mary Sue and Joan Goo, whose authors have spent a lot of time writing love, writing love and even quoting classics, are too brief and unconvincing to make a difference in the critical moment when the emotions of the individual are changing, which makes the words of several protagonists seem unconvincing.
0	What do you see when the photos are not good, the text is not good, the paper is not good, the style is back in the '90s?
1	I know most of this common sense.
0	The textbook Mary Sullivan, a typical young girl's comic book, sets the following: n pursuers, fate-bound, invincible, and head-on-the-road-master blablabla is just cool, after all the dramas and the girl-masters are growing up the way they end up playing for love and not doing it. It's too cumbersome to write, and these two questions are not really three stars.
0	It's a lot worse than the dragons.
0	She's hanging out here.
0	There's a lot of hard cuts in science. As a fairy tale magic story, the logic of the story is not evaluated. As a matter of writing, characters are still biased in labeling. Women masters are well shaped. They are used to deceive young girls.
0	Why would anyone spend more than a hundred on this stuff?
0	It's so sad. It's so sad. It's so sad.

0	It's a terrible translation.
1	Some places are hard. The whole thing's not working.
1	Fifteen years ago, when the book was first seen in Halloween, it was simply unaffordable. The reprints of 26 pages were definitely worth reading. Doycher himself, as a Marxist anti-Stalinist, was familiar with the Soviet logic of development and the path of internal theory, an analysis that was more relevant than an American ideological and moral analysis. Three volumes of 1,600 pages read together, unconscionablely, and much of the analysis was thought out and strongly recommended.
0	I've been reading books so boring lately. It's weak, it's childish, it's sometimes radiant, but it's still being used again and again. It's as if it's red. It's as if it's not moving. It's as if it's the same thing. It's as if it's not boring. It's not as if it's the same thing.
0	The author, while trying to fabricate a few characters, has a similar face and a lack of recognition, which suggests that the author is not divided, but rather paranoid and narcissistic. It can only be seen as the inner monologue of a young lesbian.
0	I'm sorry, I don't believe the author, even if he says it's true. Do you know what else the author is doing?
1	A big view of history.
1	That's good.
1	It's all gold...
1	The unexpected look, which was supposed to be a long look and a bird's eye, came up with a detailed description, a very strong sense of camera and image, as in the case of the war reporters. It was only after seeing the Ottomans' atrocities that the Grand Duke understood Lord Vlad as the national hero of the other.

1	There's no theoretical thickness, but direct, emotional, commercial!
0	It's just too corny.
0	What the hell?
0	Is it true that the modern people of the ordinary world are as good as they eat and drink when they arrive in ancient times? To be honest, I really don't believe in the so-called superiority of the modern people, and there is a real risk that they will not survive.
0	Serious discourses are mixed with strange hearsays and brain fillings. The final chapters slide directly from the earlier meaningful systems and cultures to distorted narratives that are disgusting to colonialism so that the average score of the book is four and a half.
1	The desire of the audience to watch the film -- it's the power of attraction -- is a strong motive, greater than any comment.
0	I don't like it.
1	The heights of Luzhen art are very shocking.
0	That's funny. But it's stupid! Give it to Samsung, I'm sorry about the Samsung novel.
1	It's been 20 years since the Great River went down, from 1978 to 1998, and it's amazing that everyone has their own features, and that there's no single, non-black, or white, or absolutely good or bad, and that it's not easy for everyone to get up and fall in their lives, and they're looking for new things. A novel can look at the sea, and it's not just a label, and finally, it's too much for you to come back to the village you came out of in 1978.
0	One day is a lifetime, and that's a clever idea. But it has to be said that such a thin, messy description of life is not what I love, that there's a feeling of putting all my energy into a meaningless thing, that it takes energy and patience and effort to read it. Although this calm may be the norm in 30 years of marital life, it's still boring through a few hundred pages of novels. Read the whole book and end up touching only one sentence on the cover: “It's like breathing. Exhale, losing, breathing, getting.” Whether it's a broken family life, or almost forgotten passion and love, it's breathing between it.”
0	Boring and unfaithful.

1	Some say that Herzog is the will of the new German film, that Schrondov is a limb, and that the powerful will and the aggressive action of Herzog are in combination. He combines movies with travel, adventures, interviews, he is a crazy film adventurer, and he is also an anti-hero, anti-intellectual, anti-institutional conscientious filmmaker, who cares about the blind, dumb, deformed, and condemned to death, and who is as unwieldy as a person as a movie maker.

0	It's called the Philosophy Detective, actually? There's very little philosophy, and there's nothing bright about it. It's based on medieval history and religion. The story can be summarized as follows: the main character goes to a place, he finds a character, he gets a prop, he gets a prop, he gets a prop, he gets a prop, he gets a prop.

0	That's the best. I think it's the most ridiculous. It's like a bunch of men for more than a decade to study hate theories to spend their lives with a woman. It's just open up, and it's too disconcerting for so many people to bury you.
1	It was just a casual look, but I was in the toilet at 3:00 a.m. and I wasn't tortured to cry, but I felt the love that I had passed away, and Oh Ka-Hin could go after it for good, and I failed the years and was ashamed of it.

0	It's normal. Can't even read the layout again?
0	In a similar utopian way, this post puts an utopian expression of utopian love at an end. The role of hegemonic CEOs, ordinary girls, cheating stepmothers, aborted women, and sex companions is vivid and more pure and thorough than Small Ages. Interesting, especially interesting, very happy.

0	The author goes to every place to think of his woman. If he still walks so many places, he can't see the wider meaning of life and a deeper human understanding, it's gone for nothing.
0	The first generation is sobbing, the second generation of the rich, the second generation of the halo, and by the third generation, it's all a piece of paper that uses dialogue and pale-faced writing to advance the plot.
0	Not much depth, not a good picture.
0	Real science books, for those who can't see this part of history. It's obvious that more than 300 pages of human history are not enough in financial terms, and short remarks, especially these polarized comments (lessons learned).
1	I love this nagging dialogue. We're talking too little about faith, about self, about the basics of survival.
1	It's hard not to compare it to the west side of the pool, but it's better to like it. The two uncles are not natural saviours who bring wisdom and justice to themselves, who are more difficult to save than the ones they save. But it's really not good for me to see that the real version is Yongping and A too.

0	A boring love story, what the author wants to say is that love can come back to life? If there's no such fictional story, there's nothing to say, it's just a bunch of bugs.
0	She thinks she's writing a butterfly effect version of Laura running, and it's just seven times over a bridge in Twilight. And, worse still, we're going to have to endure the author's very crude writing style seven times.

1	A few examples are very interesting — if we had agreed to meet one day in Shanghai (Hangzhou, Beijing, New York) but not in time and place — what should we do about it?
1	But the bottom colour of the City of the Last is despair, and the flash of any hope is a luxurious movie. And the price of the Leapness is that, in a disaster that is unsettlingly read, there are those who never lose hope and the bottom line. This is a proud story.

1	The translation is quite well based on the fact that people in the world of employment are indulging in Hong Kong films, and the author’s help when writing does not feel anything like a translation. From a point of view, it is an excellent reading of Hong Kong films for ordinary fans.

1	Is the greatest problem revealed by this book one of the important factors in considering the evolution of natural geography when considering the course of history? Not only is the harsh climate causing a sharp decline in productivity in the South and its persistence in the South, but it will also allow the nomadic peoples of the North to engage in much more pressing southward aggression to sustain their livelihoods?
