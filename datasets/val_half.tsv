"i'm sorry to hear you're feeling anxious about your penis size and how it might affect your sexual performance. and i want to assure you your feelings are perfectly normal. i think all men go through a period of insecurity regarding their penis size. society puts a lot of emphasis on this particular aspect of ""masculinity "" after all. i hasten to assure you that your penis probably is perfectly normal in size. but your best bet to completely set your mind at ease about the situation is to make an appointment with a urologist. he or she can examine you and tell you if everything's ok. also you may be surprised to learn that medically speaking penis size isn't measured based on the erect organ. rather penis size is measured by ""stretched penis length. "" the article i linked above will give you a lot of information about average penis length how to measure your penis and when to see a doctor. i hope this helps set your mind at ease! don't worry about it. the average penis in america is 6 inches. i to am not well endowed but my wife love mine. she says it is just right and doesn't hurt her. you are probably going by the magazines and movies. trust me they are not normal sized. we are created individually and when you find mrs. right she won't care. there are excersizes that will enlarge thickness and length. they do work. it is a slow process but it can be done. also some of the enlargement drugs that is on the market do enlarge by increasing the blood flow and amount that the penis will tolerate. again its a slow process but it is possible. there are also excersizes to allow you to last for very long time before you climax that really turns your mate on. also with time you will learn to satisify the woman and not yourself. if you strive to satisify your mate she will hold on for life and do the same for you. if you are lucky enough to find a virgin to marry someday god will match you perfectly."	im 19 my penis is under 5inch when erect. is this normal? help i'm scared to have sexual intercourse.

the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis can be similar to rheumatoid arthritis with morning pain and stiffness along with fatigue. you may have pain and stiffness in the hands wrists elbows shoulders knees ankles feet and spine. arthritis that affects many joints symmetrically is common with psoriatic arthritis. this symmetrical pattern is almost the same as rheumatoid arthritis. yet sometimes psoriatic arthritis joints are less tender than rheumatoid arthritis joints so you may have joint deformity with psoriatic arthritis without significant pain. with psoriasis you may have thick inflamed red skin patches (called plaques) covered with white or silvery scales usually on the elbows knees or other areas. in addition more than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have nail involvement with pitted discolored or thickened nails. psoriatic arthritis can cause a sausage-like swelling of fingers and toes which usually occurs when the fingernails are pitted or discolored. in some people with psoriatic arthritis only one joint is affected yet not the other (one knee only for example). sometimes the spine is affected or just the fingers and toes. about 1/3 of patients with psoriatic arthritis have eye problems such as conjunctivitis or pink eye.	what are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?

"do you wonder whether disposable incontinence supplies are cheaper in the long run than reusable types? do you worry about putting all of those disposable items into the environment? if you are using incontinence products of any kind (pads adult diapers undergarments etc. ) you need to evaluate the types of products available based on what is most important to you — convenience or economy. there is no research to tell you which type of product is better for the skin. disposable products are convenient. purchased in quantity they can be always available when needed and require no labor other than putting them on. underwear and pads come in a wide range of sizes (waist extenders are available for some briefs) and they all are available in light medium and heavy protection levels. disposable incontinence products are more expensive than washable products in general and can cost anywhere from $200 to $400 per month depending on the amount of urine loss. this is a large expense for a person on a fixed income. some people are forced to make their own homemade pads from tissue paper towels and other materials. unfortunately medicare hmos and insurance companies don't tend to cover the cost of absorbent products and their disposal adds to environmental pollution. at the same time reusable products may not be as ""skin friendly"" as disposable ones. washable/reusable products are economical. studies have shown that some washable pads are equivalent in cost to 100 disposable pads of the same absorbency. washable underwear is available in basic styles in styles that mimic regular underwear and in styles that are elegant and indistinguishable from fine lingerie. if you are caring for someone who needs many underwear or pad changes daily the labor of washing these products is a factor to consider. incontinence garments (sometimes called adult diapers) that are washable usually have an outer layer of plastic rubber or synthetic material for protection and can be pulled up snapped on the side or open down the front. they are usually less expensive to use over time than disposable garments. because of their waterproof outer layer many women find washable garments uncomfortable because they don't ""breathe"". such women often prefer cotton underwear with a perineal pad in the crotch to collect urine leakage."	how should i choose incontinence products?

my 95 yr old father lives with my husband and myself. he also has dementia and does as you described in asking same thing over and over. i've learned once we've talked about subject few minutes if i either turn my back or have him turn around he forgets what he asked and immediately i can change subject or draw his attention away and into something else. also i've learned never to talk with him while tv volume is on or he is looking elsewhere. when he looks at me he's more likely to retain something. hope this works somewhat for you as well.	my dad is in the early stages of dementia. how do i deal with my frustration when he asks the same questions constantly?

my husband also got a shingles vaccine last year and within two months got an awful case of bell's palsy. his doctor say the vaccine could not have caused the bell's palsy because the formula for this vaccine does not contain live virus culture. i remain skeptical because my husband also has a rare blood disorder. after his diagnosis with bell's i researched more and found that live culture vaccines are never recommended for anyone with a compromised immune system like my husband. still a neurologist specializing in bell's palsy has since told us that the cause may never be known so we can't narrow it down to a possible vaccine. his facial paralysis was almost gone 8 months later until today! symptoms are back we are starting over.	my husband got the shingles vaccine and then within the year got a bad case of bell's palsy. is there a connection?

i think it is reasonable to wait at least six weeks and only with the consent of the patient’s obstetrician. there are changes that the body undergoes after pregnancy as it kind of “shrinks down” if you will and returns to normal pre-pregnancy physiology. typically that is going to take place in the first several weeks and just to make sure we suggest a six-week interval between the delivery and the cosmetic procedure. it is never wrong to wait a bit longer because the patient might not quite feel up to it and has other new responsibilities as a parent. as indicated above a physical examination must be done including blood counts and all the necessary laboratory tests to know that at that point the patient’s body is functioning just as it would had the patient never been pregnant.	how long should i wait after my pregnancy before having cosmetic surgery?
most helpful answer i don't know much about arrhythmia but it sounds like the medication might be too strong. if you are urinating a lot and very aggressively i suggest you drink heaps of water otherwise your blood volume will drop and you will experience angina light headedness may even experience peripheral arterial disease meaning you may get light headed when you walk up stairs or power walk. also take large breaths to increase oxygen intake to avoid these symptoms. my suggestion other than the obvious visit your local gp (general practitioner) they should be able to identify the issue you could have another form cvd for all i know which could completely eliminate the purpose of arrhythmia medication	heart rhythm disorder. my discharge papers says to get help if: you notice a change in speed rhythm or strength of your heartbeat. you suddenly begin peeing (urinating) more often. you get tired more easily when moving or exercising. i had my meds changed for this to a stronger mg on wednesday. today is friday. i am having rapid fluttering heartbeat and am peeing more often and lots more each time. should i be worried?

"i don't believe there are any environmental risks to living above the dentist office assuming their x-ray is properly shielded (you would need to investigate this with the dentist or landlord but it is an important bit of information that you deserve) and their ventilation system is separate. while stray x-rays can be a problem most dental films are less-penetrating (of walls) and are usually quite focused downward toward the teeth. the only other risk that i can see is the sound of the drill and screaming downstairs and perhaps that disturbing ""dental office"" smell!"	is it safe for a child to live in an apartment that is located directly over a dentist's office? . i have a 4-year-old daughter. we are losing the lease on our current apartment and have found a very nice apartment to move into that is on the 2nd floor of a building which has a dentist office on the ground floor. we will be directly above the dentist. does such a living arrangement pose any risk to my child what with the dental office containing an x-ray machine?

it's possible that the estroven may not have had the protective effects that the vet intended. there isn't any real estrogen in it just plant estrogens and a lot different herbs to calm menopause symptoms. that could be part of a cause of the issues. here's a great article on exactly what's in estroven: <link>	what are the long term effects of estrogen overdose in a dog? . my dog was on synthetic estrogen for about 5 years. i used over the counter estroven for humans 1/2 pill daily. my 1st vet was ok with it. she's been off the estrogen for 2 yrs. we have seen 3 more vets since. issues are: she is bald (except for her head) and her rear joints are deteriorating fast. she is 9 yrs old. no success in help for baldness or joint issues. could long term od of estroven be the cause?
i've gone back and forth with the depo injections and oral contraceptives for the last decade or so i can't decide which is the lesser of the evils. there are certainly pros and cons to each but in the end i decided to stick with the oral contraceptives. why? although convenient (you only go in every quarter or so for a shot) but like you i've gained quite a bit of weight after the initial shot and my weight continue to skyrocket with each injection. after about three years i have gained a total of about 1/3 of my pre-depo body weight! not only was my body image suffering since the injections but my moods swings were swinging at full force i was tired all the time and my calcium levels were fast depleting! i loved the convenience of not having to take the pill on a daily basis but side effects of the injections turned me into someone who i ultimately hate! now that i'm back on the pill most of the side effects i've suffered from the depo has left my system and i'm somewhat back to my pre-depo body weight but i'm feeling so much more energized and alive! i didn't know the extent of the side effects until i decided on another form of birth control. true the pill may be a pain in the rear for someone as forgetful as i am but i'd rather forget and have to use a backup method than to suffer the ill effects the depo injections. birth control is a definite must for some women (myself included) and i've accepted the fact that there are side effects to any substance we take but it shouldn't interfere with our daily lives and turn us into someone/something we're not! with this experience i've learned that depo injections just didn't work for me but it may for others. in the end i think you should have an in-depth discussion with your gyn weigh your options and figure which will work best for you based on your needs your lifestyle and your preference.	birth control shot making me fat and moody? . i was on the pill for about 6 months but switched to the shot because of depression issues. i have been on the shot for about 9 months now and have gained about 30 pounds and am very moody. i need to be on birth control but don't know what method would work best for me.
this is a common question i receive from patients. you've probably seen many commercials on tv offering assistance to patients who cannot afford their medications. many pharmaceutical companies offer prescription assistance programs which can include free or discounted medications. i recommend you work with your health care provider to identify the right medication for your condition and then contact the pharmaceutical company who manufactures that medication to see if you qualify for the prescription assistance program. contact the partnership for prescription assistance at www. pparx. org or by calling 888-477-2669.	i've heard that pharmaceutical companies sometimes offer discounts on drugs. how would i get access to those discounts?

i can understand that you would be concerned for your health but as you said your bp is high when you take it or when you go to either the doctor's office or to the er. this indicates that it's really situational but i can also understand that you would like to be able to be a bit calmer. chronic stress is what can cause medical illness but i didn't see that you indicated you are under chronic stress. i would suggest however that you begin to learn some ways to help yourself remain calm. i don't know if you have regular medical checkups but that would be a good start. once you know that everything is okay medically then you can begin using some self-help techniques. since you are still a minor i would suggest that you discuss this with your parents and that there there should be a discussion between them and your treating physician. i hope that you have made your parents aware of your concern since it would be helpful to have their understanding and support.	i'm only 17 but afraid of heart disease. my blood pressure is often too high at the doctor's office. what can i do?

this is a difficult question to answer. compounding used to be more popular than it is now. pharmacists were trained to compound in school and any nearly pharmacist could prepare medication for you in this way. now many pharmacy schools have compounding training available but do not require the course. a compounded medication is a product that a pharmacist makes on an individual basis because it is not commercially provided. pharmacists need to make sure the ingredients can remain stable in the mixture and that they will provide proper treatment for the patient’s condition. recipes for compounds are not standard so sometimes the pharmacist has to conduct research to obtain a recipe for the compounded medication that your physician has prescribed. many chain pharmacies do not have pharmacist that are trained to compound. if you need a compounded prescription they should be able to direct you to another pharmacy to suit your need there are community pharmacies available that specialize in compounding. but you want to do some research. check with your local children’s hospital to see if they have an outpatient pharmacy that will fill your prescription. if they do not see if they can recommend a local pharmacy that is able to compound the medication for you.	is every pharmacy able to compound medications for my child?

usually rebound headaches are treated by a neurologist and its better to find one that treats a lot of headaches. almost any of the prevention medications can help with rebound headaches but i usually start with one of the medications that has an fda indication for migraine prevention (inderol depakote or topamax). as these gradually start working you will take less excedrin and end up off the medication. sometimes changing what you take for a headache helps also such as changing to a prescription version of naproxen or using one of the triptans like imitrex or relpax. there are more aggressive treatments for rebound headaches that involve admission to the hospital and iv medications but i usually don't start off with that as the first treatment.	can you recommend a medication for rebound headaches besides excedrin?
a paresthesia is an abnormal sensation of tingling numbness or burning. paresthesias are usually felt in the hands feet arms or legs but can be felt anywhere. the sensation is usually unpleasant. most people have experienced paresthesia in the form of the pins-and-needles sensation that occurs when an arm or leg briefly “falls asleep. ” the sensation is caused by sustained pressure placed on a nerve. this kind of paresthesia is temporary and reversible. paresthesias can also occur regularly when nerves experience ongoing or lasting damage. some of the causes of chronic or persistent paresthesias include: carpal tunnel syndrome meralgia paresthetica (numbness over the outer thigh) compression of a nerve in the spine (radiculopathy) restless legs syndrome shingles (herpes zoster) stroke or transient ischemic attack multiple sclerosis transverse myelitis the treatment for paresthesias depends on the cause. if a reversible cause is present treating it should help improve the paresthesia symptoms. for paresthesias that can’t be cured medicines that act on nerves may be helpful for some people.	what is paresthesia?

i'm sympathetic because i know the healthcare. gov website has been very frustrating. the good news is that it is getting better but it is still not where it needs to be. you can go to an agent to find out about the different policies but in order to qualify for a subsidy you must purchase coverage through your state's marketplace/exchange. you can also use a navigator in your area to help you go through your options. they can also help you enroll in a plan. you can find a navigator in your area by going to this website: <link>.	i've been trying to check out my eligibility and compare rates for the health insurance marketplace plans. however the website has been down. the insurance companies are offering some lower rate plans with the same sort of coverage but there are so many options and variables that it's extremely confusing. i can't even find out if i'm actually eligible for the marketplace plans until a rep calls me back to give me the information that the website can't because it's broken! do you recommend calling an insurance agent to try to help sort this mess out? will an agent be able to help us with the marketplace plans?

i can't offer you a definitive answer based solely on your brief description. i would need to see and exam this child but one possibility would be impetigo -- a staph or skin strep infection. there can certainly be many other causes. ten year olds like to swing on bars during recess and often get blisters. if they pick at those blisters on a dirty hand it can become secondarily infected and this infection can spread to the mouth quite easily.	my 10 year old got a hand blister and now she has scabs around her mouth. what could this be. the blister had skin coming out. the mouth stores just happens when she woke up from a nap

technically yes. if sperm from the cowper's gland i see no logical reason why sperm wouldn't also survive traveling on fingers. sperm are not fragile. they are extremely tough. the journey they take to reach the egg is like running a marathon but with toxins traps & fluids rushing at you. they can also live up to 5 days after ejaculation. you can watch the journey that sperm take on youtube. it's incredible. the risk of pregnancy is very low and the semen needs to still be very moist too be alive but yes you can get pregnant.

"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i wish i could tell you what's causing your pain but there are many possibilities. there are no bodily organs in the area you describe. there are only small intestine and the colon. if you are eating and drinking passing gas and having bowel movements those are all good signs your colon is working well. an ovarian cyst can cause pain like you describe and so could healing after a hysterectomy with removal of the ovaries. as scar tissue forms inside it can contract and be quite painful. this usually clears up over time. the area can indeed feel ""lumpy"" inside where sutures have been placed. this too should go away with time. i suggest you contact your gynecologist about the pain. he or she is in a better position to give you an opinion about the cause because s/he knows your complete medical history. you have a right to have your pain controlled. this may not mean you have no pain at all. but on a 0-10 scale where 0 is no pain you should be able to aim for pain in the 3-4 range. if your pain is worse than that (and it sounds like it is) contact your doctor for better management of the situation. wishing you well!"	pain left side below the rib cage & above the hip bone hunger pains eating helps but still pain lots of gas. age 61 pain for 6 months had colonoscopy before that no symptoms also had robotic hysterectomy (40 days) ago (drs thought ovarian cancer scare) pain persists. what is on the left side of the body below the rib cage & above hip bone actually hurts to lie on the left side like laying on a rocks. . . . help. .

hi this is from the uk’s nhs. athlete’s foot is a common fungal infection of the foot. an itchy red rash develops in the spaces between your toes. the affected skin may also be scaly flaky and dry. the medical name for athlete’s foot is tinea pedis. harmless bacteria and fungi live naturally on your skin but if these organisms multiply your skin can become infected. a group of fungi called dermatophytes is responsible for athlete’s foot. dermatophytes live in and feed off dead skin tissue. your feet provide a warm dark and humid environment – ideal conditions for the fungi to live and multiply. athlete's foot spreads very easily. it can be passed from person to person through contaminated towels clothing and surfaces. the fungi can survive and multiply in warm and humid places such as swimming pools showers and changing rooms. but then who wears socks in these places? do hope this helps you. good luck	can a person wearing socks in a place like a gym or a home prevent them from picking up athlete's foot? . i am opening a daycare and children like to take off their shoes and some even like to take off their socks. i am trying to find out if wearing socks is enough of a barrier to prevent someone from picking up the fungus somehow and transmitting it.

although it is hard to say if you have the flu or not if you are still feeling ill please call you healthcare provider and ask their advice about treatment for your illness if you get the flu pumping your breast milk and having a healthy adult give your baby the breast milk is a good way to protect your baby. the flu virus is not transmitted through breast milk. maternal antibodies are transmitted through breast milk which may actually help protect the child if s/he was already exposed to influenza. it is ok to take antivirals to treat the flu while you are breastfeeding. if there is no one else who can take care of your baby while you are sick try to wear a face mask at all times when you are feeding or caring for your baby. you should also be very careful about washing your hands and taking everyday precautions to prevent your baby from getting flu. using a cloth blanket between you and your baby during feedings might also help. if you think your baby has developed flu-like symptoms please call your healthcare provider quickly so your baby may be examined.	is the flu virus transferable through breast milk? . i think i have the flu or a virus of some kind was violently ill yesterday morning; vomiting fever chills body aches and joint pains stomach cramps headache fatigue. i still don't feel well nothing like yesterday though. i just wanted to know if my 9 month old whom i am still nursing will catch the same virus and have the same symptoms through my breast milk?

"there is research that shows that barbecuing can be hazardous to your health. but don't worry there is still a way to have your ""barbecued steak"" and eat it too. the health problem lies in the meat. research has discovered two cancer-causing (carcinogenic) byproducts associated with barbecuing red meat poultry lamb pork and fish. the first is a carcinogen called heterocyclic amines (hcas). the national institute of health department of health and human services included hcas on its reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen list. hcas are formed due to the high temperatures occurring when meat is overcooked or char-grilled. studies have shown that when hcas were fed in the diet rodents developed cancers in many organs including the colon breast and prostate. research is still underway to determine if this applies to humans as well. the second carcinogen associated with barbecuing is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). they are formed when fat drips onto the coal or hot surface. the smoke carries the pahs to the food. they can also form directly on the food when it is charred. the recipe for healthy barbecuing is to follow some simple tips: don't get too hot: try to avoid overcooking food by precooking it in the microwave or oven so it won't be on the barbecue as long; keep the heat down on the grill and flip the food frequently to prevent overcooking on one side; buy thinner cuts of meat so that they don't take as long to cook; and test the meat with a thermometer to see when it's ready. the usda recommended safe minimum internal temperatures are: steaks & roasts - 145 degrees f fish -- 145 degrees f. pork -- 160 degrees f. ground beef -- 160 degrees f. chicken breasts -- 165 degrees f. whole poultry -- 165 degrees f. trim the fat: go for leaner cuts of meat; cut as much fat off of the meat when possible; and flip your food instead of stabbing it with a fork to avoid the fat dripping onto the coal. take time to marinate: some research has shown the ingredients (especially vinegar) in marinades act can actually protect the meat and reduce the chances of carcinogenic compounds forming. one study found that a beef steak marinated with teriyaki sauce had a 45% and 67% lower hca level at 10 minutes than the unmarinated steak and that lower levels of hca were also observed in meat marinated with turmeric-garlic sauce. keep it clean: keep the oil and grease off your grill by turning up the heat to high and closing the lid for about 10 minutes."	what are potential health problems that can be connected to eating barbecued and smoked meats?
i guess it is possible but you are correct. oral contraception prevents ovulation by hormonal manipulation so the chance of getting an cyst related to ovulation (corpus luteum) cyst would be unlikely. with that said there are other kinds of cysts and other medical reasons to account for your symptoms so an ultrasound would be helpful to make that determination.	can you get ovarian cysts on birth control? . i've been having pains in my lower left abdomen for at least a month now and my doctor told me it could be ovarian cysts. i'm on birth control though and i thought birth control was supposed to prevent them; i've been on ortho tri cyclen for at least six months now. does anyone know if it's possible to still get these cysts while on birth control? . i am scheduling an ultra sound soon i just wanted to see if anyone had input for this.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. but i have good news: your problem probably can be fixed. it's not uncommon for women to develop bladder leakage especially after having children. the leakage (or in your case gushing) can be caused by several things from a prolapsed bladder to a weak bladder muscle. your health care provider can diagnose the cause of your bladder leakage and suggest the appropriate treatment which can range from medication to an outpatient surgical procedure. i suggest you make an appointment with your gynecologist or primary healthcare provider to have this problem diagnosed. you've suffered long enough! best wishes to you!	why is it that sometimes when i have to pee when i stand up it just pours out and i can't cut it off. i have had two children and have always peed often ever since i was a child but the older i get the worse it gets somtime i don't make it at all.
mosquito bites do not cause high fever or hives. horsefly bites cause high fever and hives. if you get bitten by a mosquito it just leaves a little red itchy bump. horsefly bites are more serious. if you are bitten by a horsefly it leaves a huge red bump about 5-8 inches long. and about 3 days later the bump fades away but then you start to get one itchy bump on a part of your body and if you scratch you break out in the known reaction as hives. the best cure for hives is an oatmeal bath or milk of magnesia. and of course rest. i wish you all good luck and p. s. stay away form horseflies.	can mosquito bites give high fever and hives? . my 2 yrs old had woke up yesterday with a couple of bites and a fever. i took him to urgent care and they said that they were mosquito bites. he had intense fever all night and when he woke with this morning i notice his skin is rashy all over like if he had an allegic reaction or the high fever did it. is it possible that the bites gave him an allergic reaction or maybe it was just the high fever that made his skin like this please advice.

i'm going to assume you received a valid prescription for tamiflu (oseltamivir) for your child(ren) because pediatric dosing is based on weight. never give a child the same dose of oseltamivir as an adult. the reason i am trying to make sure you have a pediatric prescription for the oseltamivir you're giving your children is because the medication is available as an oral suspension which is what is usually prescribed for children. keep that in mind if you need oseltamivir for your children in the future. at any rate you may pull apart the oseltamivir capsule and pour the contents into a very small amount of sweetened liquid (brown sugar mixed with water is fine) and then have your child drink the whole dose at once. i would not recommend mixing it with orange juice applesauce or any type of soda. fruits contain enzymes and acids that could reduce the effectiveness of the medication. soda contains carbon dioxide that also could act on the medication. try using a medicine cup like the one that usually comes with children's cough and cold remedies to mix up the oseltamivir with sugar water. just make sure the cup is clean. wishing you well!	can children take tamiflu mixed with orange juice or is there something else that mixes better?

what we know now is some great studies have been done within the last two years about the relationship between sleep and weight loss and weight gain. there are two hormones in particular that have specific amount to do with appetite. another thing we know about sleep deprivation is that your metabolism slows down. well if you have a slow metabolism you’re not burning fuel efficiently so it’s going into fat storage and fat deposits and again causing more weight gain. we also know with sleep deprivation we have increased levels of cortisol. well that can be another problem which causes more appetite. here’s the most fascinating part about the research i think. all those other things aside when you’re sleep deprived if i was to lay out a healthy snack for you or a very non healthy sugary snack for you you’d gun for the sugary food. you would go for the less healthy food so your food choice is even affected by sleep deprivation. how? they are not 100% sure how but that craving that you’re having seems to be more towards a comfort food which tends to be high carbohydrate high sugar high fat.	how can sleeping help me lose weight?

if the fever is coming down and other symptoms also are improving then home treatment probably is fine. if your child has a virus four days isn't very long for it to run its course. if your child's fever or other symptoms get worse instead of better or if your child develops new symptoms like vomiting diarrhea loss of appetite then it's time to seek medical attention. while you're waiting out this virus make sure your child gets plenty of fluids. water is fine and you can also give an electrolyte preparation such as pedialyte for fluid replacement. it's crucial not to let your little one get dehydrated. wishing you both well!	8 year old has had a fever of 101-99 for 4 days with cough & stuffy nose. is home treatment the best option?

"there are no ""legal requirements"". the doctor sets his own rules and parameters when it comes to refills of chronic medications. many clinicians will let you go a year; others six months. while it can be a hassle and added expense to see your medical provider they are responsible for your care. having you come in is a good opportunity to give you a check-up see about your health maintenence that you may be ignoring (blood tests cancer screenings etc. ). make the appointment and discuss this directly with the doctor. not the office manager. ask for a one-year prescription of all of your meds if he is willing."	how often does a doctor legally have to see a patient to continue refilling a prescription on a noncontrolled substance? . i am regularly prescribed a medication for a stable chronic condition. i take it daily. it is not a pain medication or anything that could be abused. for a long time my prescriptions just automatically refilled but now my doctor's office manager is insisting that my prescription refill cannot be authorized because it's illegal to refill a prescription without having seen the patient for a period of time. is this the law or is she lying to make me spend money? .

"pneumonia may be suspected when the doctor examines the patient and hears coarse breathing or crackling sounds when listening to a portion of the chest with a stethoscope. there may be wheezing or the sounds of breathing may be faint in a particular area of the chest. a chest x-ray is usually ordered to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. the lungs have several segments referred to as lobes usually two on the left and three on the right. when the pneumonia affects one of these lobes it is often referred to as lobar pneumonia. some pneumonias have a more patchy distribution that does not involve specific lobes. in the past when both lungs were involved in the infection the term ""double pneumonia"" was used. this term is rarely used today. sputum samples can be collected and examined under the microscope. pneumonia caused by bacteria or fungi can be detected by this examination. a sample of the sputum can be grown in special incubators and the offending organism can be subsequently identified. it is important to understand that the sputum specimen must contain little saliva from the mouth and be delivered to the laboratory fairly quickly. otherwise overgrowth of noninfecting bacteria from the mouth may predominate. as we have used antibiotics in a broader uncontrolled fashion more organisms are becoming resistant to the commonly used antibiotics. these types of cultures can help in directing more appropriate therapy. a blood test that measures white blood cell count (wbc) may be performed. an individual's white blood cell count can often give a hint as to the severity of the pneumonia and whether it is caused by bacteria or a virus. an increased number of neutrophils one type of wbc is seen in most bacterial infections whereas an increase in lymphocytes another type of wbc is seen in viral infections fungal infections and some bacterial infections (like tuberculosis). bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a thin flexible lighted viewing tube is inserted into the nose or mouth after a local anesthetic is administered. using this device the doctor can directly examine the breathing passages (trachea and bronchi). simultaneously samples of sputum or tissue from the infected part of the lung can be obtained. sometimes fluid collects in the pleural space around the lung as a result of the inflammation from pneumonia. this fluid is called a pleural effusion. if a significant amount of fluid develops it can be removed. after numbing the skin with local anesthetic a needle is inserted into the chest cavity and fluid can be withdrawn and examined under the microscope. this procedure is called a thoracentesis. often ultrasound is used to prevent complications from this procedure. in some cases this fluid can become severely inflamed (parapneumonic effusion) or infected (empyema) and may need to be removed by more aggressive surgical procedures. today most often this involves surgery through a tube or thoracoscope. this is referred to as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or vats."	how is pneumonia diagnosed?

"osman the most likely cause may be anxiety related. below is a link to a webmd article that lists many possible causes of high b/p combined with a rapid pulse rate: <link> according to the american hearth association there is no direct correlation between rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. here is what the american herat association says on the subject: "" a rising heart rate does not cause your blood pressure to increase at the same rate. even though your heart is beating more times a minute healthy blood vessels dilate (get larger) to allow more blood to flow through more easily. when you exercise your heart speeds up so the blood can reach your muscles. it may be possible for your heart rate to double safely while your blood pressure may respond by only increasing a modest amount. "" other factors that are unknown may also influence a diagnosis as follows: what was your blood pressure and heart rate? what activities were you engaged in prior to being tested? how many times was the testing performed? was the testing conducted on a reliably calibrated machine? was the testing performed at various times of the day? what was your pulse pressure? that number is the difference between your systolic b/p (higher number) and the diastolic (lower number)? for example a b/p of 150/70 would have a pulse pressure of 80 which is high. as you see in this example the systolic b/p is on the slightly high side & the diastolic b/p is within a normal range but the pulse pressure is high. some experts today consider a high systolic rate along with a high pulse pressure to be a serious risk factor in predicting cardiovascular disease. it is best to see a physician and discuss your concerns. that person will be in the best position to know you conduct professional testing assess the testing results and address your questions. i hope that this answer has been helpful."	what is the relation between high blood pressure and high heart/pulse rate? . i have read that when the volume of blood is high the bp rises and the pulse slows down and vice versa however in my case the bp rises when when pulse rate increases. can you please explain this relation in bp and pulse in detail. . . . thanks. . . . osman

rapid ejaculation (coming more quickly than you'd like; also called premature ejaculation) is quite common particularly among young men or those just beginning to have sex. the good news is that many men find strategies that work for them to help them last longer and gain ejaculatory control with time and practice. both the stop-start and squeeze techniques are useful long term strategies that men can use to teach themselves to pay attention to the physical sensations they experience as they get closer to climax. . short-term solutions include desensitizing condoms. that are lubricated internally with a substance that includes benzocaine. . you want to be careful not to let that substance or any other numbing agents touch your partner's mouth or vagina as it can desensitize her parts too! . to prevent premature ejaculation you need to take these 3 factors into consideration: focus on feeling focusing too much on the feelings in your penis will activate the ejaculation program (which completes within one minute. ) if you are already overstimulated before you begin intercourse you may ejaculate within seconds. performance anxiety worrying about how long you are going to last is the fastest way to lose control. this is because your lack of focus means your conscious mind is no longer focused on controlling the sexual act - which makes you lose control and ejaculate early and/or lose your erection. sexual position one of the most common sexual positions makes it difficult to stay in control of when you ejaculate. a slight tweak to this position makes it the best sexual position - and the easiest for staying connected with your partner and in control. sexual fantasies must only be used at the right time! if you are already feeling over aroused thinking about sexual fantasies will make you lose control and ejaculate. other factors to take into consideration are: sexual frustration stress and lack of confidence. all of which cause you to lose focus and lose control. hi! i am 33 years old. i tried duramale after i suffered from premature ejaculation for many months. i saw the money refund policy so i decided to buy 3 bottles on <link> since there were no risks. i was very happy about the results even after 6 weeks but i followed the treatment very strict. this was my secret i guess. i recommend duramale to everyone who suffer from early orgasm. duramale pills can be purchased only online from website through credit card debit card or paypal. for complete details and best price of duramale visit <link>	how can i prevent premature ejaculation?

"there are no differences in the smell of anyone of a different race. skin color does not have an odor. that is not to say that humans do not have their own smells. a person who eats different or aromatic foods or spices can smell different to someone who is not familiar with the smell. a person who smokes smells quite different to a non-smoker. a person who is not diligent in their personal hygiene practices can have all sorts of body odors. i have set with plenty of them on a crowded plane. there may be a smell of poverty when someone wants to be clean but does not have the same access to a shower or laundry facilities like you do. some people do not wear deodorant or use cologne. some use too much and make my eyes water. smells are in the nose of the beholder. to say that a black person smells different than any other race can be considered a racist statement. one that has absolutely no speck of truth. racial differences usually result from genetic adaptations to climate. dark skin is protected from sunburn but absorbs more heat produces more sweat. blacks sweat more than whites. as sweat evaporates it cools. good. but. sweat carries with it many organic and inorganic compounds pretty much same as in urine which beneficial bacteria on the skin consume and ""poop"" on the skin. blacks wind up with more pee and bacteria poop it is that which does not smell good on the skin. a lot of it is not ""stink"" ""per se"" all races have a unique smell generally we each like ""our own"" think ""different"" is unpleasant. not really."	why do black people have a different smell?

"you're smart to think about your blood sugar before it gets out of control. as you probably know the hemoglobin a1c test measures your blood sugar control over the preceding three months. it's a very good indicator for helping people with diabetes manage their condition better. a normal a1c range is between 4% and 5. 6%. an a1c result between 5. 6% and 6. 4% indicates you are at risk of developing diabetes. and an a1c result over 6. 4% indicates you have diabetes. you are at the low end of the at-risk category so you are starting in a good place. my best tips for managing blood sugar in the ""at-risk"" stage are: lose weight if you're overweight. this alone can lower your a1c. exercise if you don't already. all you need to do is walk. it's that simple. start with 10 minutes a day. indoors or out. just walk. work your way up to 30 minutes of vigorous walking 5 times a week. don't consume a lot of sugar. ditch the soda. read labels. sugar lurks in places you wouldn't dream of! you don't need to swear off sugar forevermore. just be mindful of your sugar intake. eat a healthy diet that is rich in fiber (plant foods) protein and healthy fats. that's pretty much it. if you do those four things chances are your next a1c will be smack in the normal range. wishing you well! thank you"	how do i lower my hemoglobin a1c (hba1c). its 5. 8 im not a diabetic. im a 51 years old female
"hi this is from the nhs in the uk gives most of the answers you want. iron deficiency anaemia rarely causes serious or long-term complications although some people with the condition find it affects their daily life. some common complications are outlined below. tiredness as iron deficiency anaemia can leave you tired and lethargic (lacking in energy) you may be less productive and active at work. your ability to stay awake and focus could decrease and you may not feel able to exercise regularly. increased risk of infections research has shown iron deficiency anaemia can affect your immune system (the body’s natural defence system) making you more likely to become ill. heart and lung problems adults with severe anaemia may be at risk of developing complications that affect their heart or lungs. for example you may develop tachycardia (an abnormally fast heartbeat) or heart failure (where your heart is not pumping blood around your body very efficiently). pregnancy complications pregnant women with severe anaemia have an increased risk of developing complications particularly during and after birth. they may also develop postnatal depression (which some parents experience after having a baby). research suggests babies born to mothers who have untreated anaemia are more likely to: be born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a low birthweight have problems with iron levels themselves do less well in mental ability tests restless legs syndrome some cases of restless legs syndrome (rls) are thought to be caused by iron deficiency anaemia. doctors may refer to this as ""secondary rls"". rls is a common condition affecting the nervous system which causes an overwhelming irresistible urge to move the legs. it also causes an unpleasant feeling in the feet calves and thighs. rls caused by iron-deficiency anaemia can usually be treated with iron supplements. do hope this helps your problem. good luck"	what are the long term effects of having anemia?
in general it is best to keep the focus on healthy eating and activity. it sounds like you are already doing a great job of emphasizing healthy habits. physical fitness basically how well your child's body works as she plays and learns (for exampler her energy level endurance strength) and not size is key. combatting the media's and society's biases about physical appearance is not easy. offering counter-examples of healthy (and realistic) body types might be something to try if she is a fairly mature 5-yr-old. also maybe showing the graph of bmis on the growth chart to your daughter might allow you to show her that she is tracking along just fine and that she is in the healthy range. i think this sounds like something that should be explored in depth with your pediatrician or a counselor. here's a few body image related articles for parents who might be facing this situation with older children. eating and body image: a troubled relationship moms kids and body image	my daughter is 5 years old and obsessed with her weight. is she developing an unhealthy body image?

calorie needs are individual and depend on age gender lean body mass and your level of activity. since you are not overweight i wonder why you count calories at all. it seems to me if you eat well balanced regular meals and let hunger and fullness guide your eating you will get the right amount for your body type. emerging research shows that young adults who eat this way (often called intuitive or mindful eating) have lower bmis -- and disordered eating -- then those who don't. it may be that you started counting calories to lose weight 5 years ago. but i say ditch the calorie counting and learn how to trust and nourish your body instead. read more. healthy eating: recognize your hunger signals	"i eat 1 200-1 500 calories a day. is that enough? . i'm 19 5""3' female and weigh 120. for the past at least five years of my life i've been eating 1 200-1 500 calories which leaves me feeling satisfied energized and maintaining my weight. i've been eating a very healthy vegan diet and have eaten pretty healthy my whole life. i feel like i'm eating enough and i'm maintaining my weight but our ""experts"" say i need to eat more. i feel like if i ate more i would just gain weight but i'm at a healthy weight now. i exercise moderately."

boys stop growing at 20 years of age whereas girls stop growing around age 18 so there still is time. first make sure you are getting enough calories. this chart will give you an idea of how much you need based on your gender age and activity level. you also want to eat regular meals and in between snacks. aim for 4-5 food groups at main meals (lean protein fruit vegetable grain dairy and healthy fat) and 2-3 food groups in between meals. make sure you get adequate calcium and vitamin d for bone growth. you are at beak bone mass and need 1300mg calcium each day! most servings of dairy contain about 300mg (1 cup milk/yogurt and 1/5 ounce of cheese) so 3-4 daily servings helps you meet your needs. the american academy of pediatrics recommend children and adolescents take supplemental vitamin d if they can't get it through diet. remember vitamin d enhances calcium absorbtion. the recommended amount is 600iu but if you are low you may need more. you can also get blood work done to be sure. lastly adequate sleep is needed during times of growth so make sure you get to bed at a decent time at night. you may not be able to do anything about genetics but maximizing nutrition and taking care of yourself can only help you grow to your potential.	i am 17 male height 5'2''. want to increase height.

"this is a good question and you're wise to think in terms of avoiding the spread of any contagious condition. the good news is perioral dermatitis isn't contagious. dermatitis means skin (derm) inflammation (itis). because dermatitis is simply an inflammation of the skin (though it's often accompanied by cracking and flaking) it's not something you spread to someone else. the ""perioral"" part of your diagnosis merely denotes the location of the dermatitis. ""peri"" being ""around "" and ""oral"" being ""the mouth. "" skin inflammation around the mouth. that's all it is. all that said you still may want to keep your makeup brushes to yourself. cracked flaky inflamed skin creates a route for someone else's viruses (like oral herpes) or bacteria to enter your skin. you can't spread your dermatitis to someone else but that doesn't mean someone else couldn't spread an infection to you. wishing you well!"	can perioral dermatitis spread on make-up brushes?

hi found you this its from the uk’s nhs stopping your medicine if you are not having any problems taking this medicine then do not stop taking it even if you feel better unless advised to do so by your prescriber. if however you find that this medicine is causing you problems then you should talk to your proscriber about your concerns. if your medical team decides that it is best that you do not take this medicine any more they may advise that you do not stop citalopram hydrobromide abruptly. this is because in some instances stopping citalopram hydrobromide abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms or cause your original condition to return. in these instances reducing the dose of citalopram hydrobromide gradually over time may reduce the chances of having these problems. if you are in any doubt contact your proscriber and this from riptych ca. uk its about side effects. common withdrawal symptoms overall the most common symptoms were: anxiety (70%) dizziness (61%) vivid dreams (51%) electric shocks / head zaps (48%) stomach upsets (33%) flu like symptoms (32%) depression (7%) headaches (3%) suicidal thoughts (2%) insomnia (2%). anxiety was the most common symptom for every antidepressant except duloxetine for which 'dizziness' was the most common. the least common symptoms across all types were stomach upsets and flu-like symptoms. these patterns were the same for men and women. do hope this helps you. good luck	i am reducing citalopram dose from 30 to 20mg. i feel nauseous dizzy lightheaded. sweating. sore throat and chills.

the risk factors for a transient ischemic attack ( tia ) are the same as those for a stroke. risk factors you can change risk factors for tia that you can change are: high blood pressure. smoking and regular exposure to secondhand smoke which are strong risk factors for stroke tia and heart attack. 2 high cholesterol. high triglycerides. 3 excessive use of alcohol. use of birth control pills especially in women who smoke or have a history of blood clots. lack of exercise. use of cocaine. risk factors you cannot change risk factors for tia that you cannot change are: age: most tias happen after the age of 60. family history: people with a family history of tia or stroke are at higher risk. prior history of tia: people who have had a tia are more likely to have another tia or a stroke. diseases that increase the risk for tia your risk for tia increases if you have diseases such as: high blood pressure. diabetes. hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) especially of the carotid arteries. atrial fibrillation and certain other heart conditions such as coronary artery disease heart failure or heart valve disorders. conditions that cause blood cells to stick together and form clots such as having too many red blood cells ( polycythemia ) abnormal clotting factors or abnormally shaped red blood cells such as those caused by sickle cell disease. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what increases the risk of getting transient ischemic attack tia?

it's important to use an eye makeup remover that's specific for waterproof mascara. i am not a big fan of waterproof mascara for that very reason. i think it does coat the eyelashes a little too heavily and can be difficult to remove and sometimes the eyelashes can come out with it. fortunately the eyelash cycle is pretty quick so your hair will grow back very quickly over time really within a matter of a few weeks. but it's uncomfortable if you are using it over a long period of time to keep losing lashes like that. so i would try recommending a water-based mascara except for very special occasions when you really need something longer lasting. then if you have the waterproof mascara look for something that's very specific and take your time. let it sit on your lashes for a little bit longer and then rinse with lukewarm water and then repeat the process without rubbing because it's the rubbing that can physically remove the lashes.	i am losing eyelashes when i wear waterproof mascara. what can i use to clean my face that won't damage my eyelashes?

medicine for toxoplasmosis is only needed when the infection affects a growing baby ( fetus ) or someone with a very weak immune system. so although a pregnant woman who has a healthy immune system is not personally at risk when infected treatment is needed to protect her fetus. if you are diagnosed with toxoplasmosis during pregnancy you will be treated with antibiotics. 3 antibiotic treatment reduces the chances that your fetus will become infected. if your fetus becomes infected (diagnosed using amniocentesis ) another antibiotic may replace or be added to your treatment. if your newborn has toxoplasmosis he or she will take antibiotics for the first year of life. this is needed to lower the risk of brain damage and blindness from the infection. medication choices antibiotic therapy what to think about antibiotic treatment during pregnancy may not cure a fetal toxoplasmosis infection. 1 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what medications and treatments are available to treat toxoplasmosis during pregnancy?

if you have significant blockage in the carotid arteries in your neck you may need a carotid endarterectomy. during this surgical procedure a surgeon removes plaque buildup in the carotid arteries to reduce the risk of transient ischemic attack (tia) or stroke. the benefits and risks of this surgery must be carefully weighed because the surgery itself may cause a stroke. your need to have carotid endarterectomy depends on whether you have had a tia and how much your carotid arteries have narrowed. you are most likely to benefit from surgery if you have had a tia in the past 6 months and you have 70% or greater narrowing in one of your carotid arteries. carotid endarterectomy may also be appropriate if your carotid arteries are moderately or severely blocked (50% to 70%) and you have had one or more tias. 10 talk to your doctor about whether a carotid endarterectomy is right for you. a relatively new procedure called carotid artery stenting is another option for some people who are at high risk of stroke. this procedure is much like coronary angioplasty which is commonly used to open blocked arteries in the heart. during this procedure a vascular surgeon inserts a metal tube called a stent inside your carotid artery to increase blood flow in areas blocked by plaque. the surgeon may use a stent that is coated with medicine to help prevent future blockage. carotid artery stenting is not as common as endarterectomy. each person must carefully weigh the benefits and risks of surgery and compare them with the benefits and risks of using medicine to reduce the risk of tia or stroke. the success of either treatment will depend on the amount of blockage you have and which medicine you use. risks of surgery depend on your age your health status the skill and experience of the surgeon and the experience of the medical center where the surgery is done. surgery choices carotid endarterectomy what to think about carotid endarterectomies are most successful when they are done by a surgeon who is well trained in the procedure and in a hospital that is well equipped to take care of any complications that may occur during or after the procedure. if you are considering carotid endarterectomy ask the hospital or state medical board about the number of times complications have occurred in people that your doctor has treated with this surgery and the complication rate at the hospital where the surgery is to be done. the american heart association stroke council recommends that surgery be performed by a surgeon who has complications in less than 3% of those treated and that the hospital rate of complications be just as low. 10 while carotid endarterectomy is often not done until several months after a tia a large study showed that people benefit most from the surgery if it is done within 2 weeks of a tia. delaying surgery longer than 2 weeks increases the risk for stroke because people are more likely to have a stroke in the first few days and weeks after a tia. these results also point out why it is so important to see a doctor immediately if you have any signs of tia. 11 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for transient ischemic attack tia?

"many factors must be considered before starting your exercise program… your overall health including cardiac and lung functioning to name a couple. your knee replacement is also a relevant factor in determining exercise suitability. for example my wife is being treated for congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. she is also looking to lose some weight and had a full knee replacement done in june 2013. her orthopedic surgeon recently ordered more physical therapy in response to knee pain and some range of motion limitations. after you are cleared medically perhaps a licensed physical therapist could customize an exercise program that would address your knee replacement specifically. the up side of this plan is that your knee will be strengthened and your body as a whole will benefit. additionally the physical therapist will act as a cheerleader to support your exercise goals. any exercise directed at the knee should be a justifiable as a billable treatment in the eyes of most insurance companies. my wife is riding a stationary bicycle doing knee squats has weights wrapped around her knee area while elevating the leg and walking using the parallel bar platform. these exercise techniques can also be employed at home with the number of repetitions and endurance being gradually increased. swimming is also a great exercise that should not have negative consequences in response to your knee replacement. these are my recommendations <negative_smiley> 1) discuss your weight loss desire with your family doctor. perhaps he or she will recommend a great diet to kick start your weight loss program and clear you medically for an exercise program (2) phone your orthopedist and ask for a physical therapy referral to strengthen your knee (3) call your medical insurance provider to find an approved physical therapy company in your living area. the process of losing weight after knee replacement is an obtainable goal through diet and exercise. your success will probably be measured in small incremental steps. remember as a chinese proverb states “a long journey starts with the first step. "" best wishes for your success."	i'm a 51 year old women i weigh 206 and cholesterol at 250 my knee been replace what exercise can i do to lose weigh?

i am assuming you had a middle ear infection (there are different types). not a common problem for a 40 year old but happens nonetheless. fluid can be from a few different sources. middle ear infections can sometimes cause the eardrum to break/rupture. small ruptures could create a leak and large ruptures can cause a flood of fluid usually accompanied by blood. fluid can also be caused by water in the ear canal perhaps trapped behind a little wax dam. when you lie down more heat is created in the ear canal and these little dams can break causing this trapped water to come out on your pillow or show in your outer ear. it can be yellow (wax-stained) or clear. q-tip users tend to create a lot of these wax dams. neither one of these conditions is considered serious even a tiny rupture. most will heal in a few weeks. you can see your medical provider to be properly examined and to make sure the infection has resolved. many times the source of this fluid may not be obvious since the dam may have broken and the eardrum may have healed. assuming you are not having ear pain or signs of infection you could wait it out a bit longer. or see your doctor. since you are six weeks after your infection it may be best to be examined.	"i was diagnosed with an ear infection sept 4th. i still have fluid ""trickle"" from my ears at night. do i need to go back. i finished all of my antibiotics. it took at least a week for my ear to ""unplug"". i am 40 years old. my ear doesn't hurt very much anymore - but i'm still feeling the fluid trickling out when i'm asleep. wasn't sure if this was normal or if i need to go back and have it looked at again. it's been 6 weeks. thanks!"

"cats and dogs are different species but many higher-allergic children are allergic to many animal danders. to be sure just ask the medical provider for a blood test for cat dander as well. longer-haired dogs have more dander than the bald ones and there are some breeds that shed very little and are tauted as ""hypo-allergenic"" dogs but i am skeptical. the sex of the dog should not make a difference. i never met a child that was only allergic to male dogs and not females etc. w when an allergic person ""reacts"" and starts showing signs of allergy (itching hives sneezing wheezing swelling etc. ) we often blame the last thing they did. something they ate touched inhaled or encountered but that is only circumstantial. a child with allergies typically is allergic to many things including some things that were not even tested. if you are being pressured to get a pet. a dog or a cat. it is best to be tested first before you acquire and animal and become attached to it."	what is the likelihood that a 4 year old child allergic to cats will also be allergic to dogs? . does it matter whether the cats/dogs are male or female? are some breeds of dog more allergenic than others? if the symptom includes a puffy face which is not usual for her cat reactions could this be due to exposure to a dog or other allergenic?

symptomatic treatment may occur while the underlying illness is being investigated because ideally nausea and vomiting should resolve when the cause of the symptoms resolves. nausea and vomiting are often made worse when the patient is dehydrated resulting in a vicious cycle. the nausea makes it difficult to drink fluid making the dehydration worse which then increases the nausea. intravenous fluids may be provided to correct this issue. there are a variety of antinausea medications (antiemetics) that may be prescribed. they can be administered in different ways depending upon the patient's ability to take them. medications are available by pill liquid or tablets that dissolve on or under the tongue by intravenous or intramuscular injection or by rectal suppository. common medications used to control nausea and vomiting include promethazine (phenergan) prochlorperazine (compazine) droperidol (inapsine) metoclopramide (reglan) and ondansetron (zofran). the decision as to which medication to use will depend on the specific situation.	how is nausea or vomiting treated?

there’s a new fascinating study that suggests rocking does indeed have an effect on our ability to fall asleep as well as on the quality of the sleep itself. researchers at the university of geneva switzerland tested the effects of rocking on sleep in a dozen adult men between the ages of 22-38. all the men involved were good sleepers — none were suffering from any sleep or anxiety disorders and they were well rested at the time of the experiment. researchers created a special bed that mimicked the rocking of a hammock and had the men take two 45-minute naps. during one nap the bed gently rocked and during the other nap the bed remained still. while their subjects slept researchers measured brain activity using an electroencephalogram (eeg). here’s what they found: every one of the participants fell asleep more quickly during their rocking nap. a majority (8 of 12) said they found the rocking nap “more pleasant” than the nap on the stationary bed. during the rocking nap all of the sleepers moved more quickly from stage one to t stage two of their sleep cycle. stage two is where we typically spend half of our sleep time over the course of a night. while rocking sleepers showed significant increases in the types of brain-wave activity that are specifically associated with deeper more restful and more continuous sleep.	does rocking help make it easier to fall asleep?
"the answer to your question is a bit more complex than it might seem. the first question is: how did you take your daughter's temperature? is it an oral temperature? armpit? ear? forehead? each of these methods produces a different ""normal"" temperature range. for example we expect to see a temperature around 98. 6 with an oral reading but an armpit temp will be lower than that. a rectal or ear (tympanic) temperature may be higher than 98. 6. secondly if you took your daughter's temperature orally did you do so shortly after she'd had something cool or cold to drink? if so this can lower the thermometer reading significantly. an oral reading should be taken at least 20 minutes after eating or drinking anything. try taking a second reading to see if the number changes. if you're taking an oral reading be sure to do it properly. have your daughter lift her tongue then place the tip of the thermometer well under your daughter's tongue up against the midline ""frenulum"" (the tissue that divides the underside of the tongue). have your daughter gently close her mouth while you hold onto the thermometer in order to keep the probe well-seated under the tongue. the thermometer should stay at about a 45-degree angle. third are you sure the thermometer is accurate? cleanse the thermometer and take someone else's temperature. do you get a relatively accurate reading? if your daughter's oral or rectal temperature really is 95. 2 and she has other symptoms such as: sluggishness paleness difficulty speaking or responding to your questions mental confusion. then you should seek immediate medical attention. it's not common but certain types of serious illnesses or infections can cause a drop in body temperature. and since your daughter is just 5 years old you don't want to take any chances. i hope this helps!"	my 5 year old daughter has been sick and now she has a temperature of 95. 2. is this too low? should we be concerned? . please help any way you can. thank you in advance.

this is great time to get a flu shot for your baby. this season the flu vaccine is being recommended for all individuals 6 months and older. for children under 9 years old who have not received a flu vaccine before it is recommended that they receive two doses (1 month apart) in order to have maximum immunity this season. the sooner you get the first round the sooner you can get the second. the flu vaccine won't prevent you from getting sick with the common cold or stomach flu but it can provide up to 80-90% protection against influenza which is a virus responsible for many deaths and hospitalizations each winter season. side effects are minimal -- possibly some redness or soreness at the site or a mild fever for a day. the injectable flu vaccine is made from a killed virus so there is no chance of your baby catching the flu from the flu vaccine. i hope some of this information is helpful. your pediatrician should be able help answer your questions as well. i always remind my families that the more close contacts who receive the flu vaccine the better insulated from the flu their baby will be.	my 6 1/2-month-old has not been vaccinated for flu yet and his doctor says he should be. what is your advice?

"shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus the virus that also causes chickenpox. in a person who has been exposed to chickenpox -- or its vaccine -- the virus never really goes away. it can lie dormant in the body's nerves. in most cases it stays that way. but in some -- especially people with immune systems weakened by disease or treatment -- the virus can reappear. this is likely to happen years or decades after the person had chickenpox. when it comes back the virus can cause shingles: a rash that often appears as a band on one side of the body. early shingles symptoms can include: headache light sensitivity flu-like symptoms without fever. itching tingling or extreme pain where the rash is developing may come next and the pain can be moderate to severe. are you contagious? though people who haven't had chickenpox can catch that condition from you the shingles itself isn't contagious. for reasons that experts don't really understand the pain of shingles lingers for some. if the pain lasts for at least four months after the shingles rash appeared a person is diagnosed with phn. in some people the pain will subside. in others it won't.

i'm sorry you're experiencing this. unfortunately the only way to diagnose what's going on is through a physical examination. many things could cause the bump you're describing such as a small cyst. only a medical professional can tell you what's going on. the key points here are: you have a bump where there shouldn't be one and it's uncomfortable. those two facts alone warrant a trip to the doctor. this isn't an emergency but why not go see your gynecologist to get this diagnosed and treated if necessary? best wishes to you! i have in the past had what amounted to a pimple in that area before. if you can stand it! leave it alone! use cold and heat if it helps! if not better in a few days go to the doctor! i couldn't stand it! did what you are not supposed to do! instant relief and healing. have found in my 46 years that i am not alone! very common from what i hear. good luck! best wishes.	small bump near entrance of vagina no discharge or anything hurts when wiped over not sexually active. what is it? . today when using the restroom i noticed a small bump near the entrance of my vagina it hurt when i wiped and it's pretty uncomfortable in general. there hasn't been any kind of discharge from it. i'm also not sexually active. what could it be?

hi this below is from nuvaring. nuvaring is used in a 4-week cycle. keep nuvaring in your vagina for 3 weeks (21 days) and then remove it for a 1 week (7 day) break. the ring should be inserted and removed on the same day of the week and at the same time. (for example if you insert your nuvaring on a monday at 8:00 a. m. you should remove it on the monday 3 weeks later at 8:00 a. m. ) you will usually get your period during the 1-week break that you remove nuvaring. insert a new nuvaring after the 1-week break. the new ring should be inserted on the same day of the week and at the same time that you inserted it the last month even if your period has not stopped. or like some women do is to keep just replacing the ring to get no periods if so then you will never no where you are then perhaps you should start again as above. hope this helps your problem. good luck	when do i do a pregnancy test while i have a nuvaring? . i don't cycle off of the nuvaring so that i don't get periods which give me unbearable cramps. i over think things a lot. i question if my birth control is working properly. i took many pregnancy tests over the last 3 days due to the fact that for the first day it said i was positive and the next 2 days it said i was negative. i did have some vaginal bleeding first day. i'm getting a blood test but i heard results are only accurate a few days before a period. and i don't know when my period is

if your allergies are making you develop fluid in your lungs then there is a possibility of pneumonia because pneumonia is when the fluid in your lungs gets infected. also yes allergies defiantly influence asthma. if you are have severe problems or you are an elder then it sounds like having the tests could only be a good thing	can allergies lead to pneumonia? should i be concerned about asthma? is there any advantage to more allergy testing? . my almost 3 year developed pneumonia a couple of weeks ago as shown on a chest x-ray. the doctor treated it with antibiotics and put her on zyrtec because she saw signs of ar. we did blood allergy testing using the toddler panel. it showed a high total ige but no specific allergies. she had some wheezing as a baby and we use a nebulizer with albuterol as needed when she develops a cold or congestion. i feel like she struggles to breath at times but its hard to tell with a 2 year old.
hello both of you were very much protective and thus neither pregnancy nor any infection can be an issue here. i presume being a new performer there is some trauma inside following sex and that can be an issue here. just avoid sex now take some sitz bath and drink plenty of water. if despite all of these you do not feel comfortable within few days; meet your gp for an opinion.	my boyfriend decided to come over to visit me for 2 days because we live in two different states. after sexual intercourse with a condom and we used multiple condoms to be safe in one night. we ran through 5 condoms in one night because we were uncertain about the infections and possibilities of pregnancy. we did not finger and only sexual intercourse. this was my second time attemping this and it did hurt quite a lot when inserting his penis. my problem is that after a couple of days we started on saturday and sunday it started to hurt on the following wednesday and thursday. the pain hurts a lot when i go pee and i feel like my vagina is burning making it uncomfortable to sit. i was sitting on the toilet for some time and randomly i had to go poop making everything go away after. now i feel fine with no pain. i also had a weird light headache as well for a bit before i went poop. p. s i know it's bad to check the condoms for holes but he checked for leakage with water.
hi ok if your frightened its an std do you have an std/gum clinic near by if so give them a look in and get them to look at for you perhaps they can have some idea what it is even if its not and std or sti. could be the way to go. good luck	genital rash. started 2nd week in march 2014. right side of scrotum. soon spread through entire scrotum and was very red and itched. after a month or so it moved to the right side of my penile gland. these symptoms only really bother me when wearing pants for work. then last two weeks started to itch in anus and thighs. no bumps no nothing. doctor says fungal. haven't had sex since february. no relief and all areas are still involved. multiple creams applied two from doctor and one i started a day or two ago!
you know that is a good question. let me start off with this. the question of the medium complected person the olive skinned patient that has perhaps brown eyes what do we do for them because i’ve stated that they are not the perfect candidate. well there are people who kind of fall into you’re probably okay type department. what we do there is rather than guess what the result would be we do what we call a patch test or a demo. we take a little bit of the chemical we put it on the skin of the forehead usually under where the hair would conceal it and we test the skin kind of like paint companies test paint put it out in the sun for a few months. we’re going to see how that skin behaves and we’re going to see what the end color is. now we may have to wait 3 to 6 months. it may take that long for the pink color to fade and for the skin to get to the ultimate color it’s going to be. most of the time it’ll be lighter but in some people it could be darker and we’d like to know that. now it’s a color issue for these people. it’s not an issue of a greater chance of other serious complications like scarring or the white bumps it’s strictly the color. but that is important because people would like to have uniform color and natural look. but we also have to remind that patient that since most people’s skin will lighten up a little bit if they have a reasonable amount of pigment then there’s a potential color difference between the treated face and the untreated neck. now that can be concealed with makeup and not necessarily heavy makeup but the patient needs to know that going in because there are some women for example who say but i don’t ever wear makeup and i don’t want to wear makeup and if i’m going to look like i’ve got a color difference then maybe this isn’t for me and i agree it isn’t for them. but if we can show them by the patch test the sample test the demo what the outcome will be then they can make a better decision. we still have to deal with the patient who has some darkness and increased darkness from sun damage and there are less intense ways to deal with even if a patient does develop pigmentation because perhaps they went out in the sun a little too soon or perhaps they went water skiing and washed off their sunscreen we do have bleach creams that are very effective within 4 to 6 weeks when applied once a day will bleach out that pigment. really? yeah not the extent of michael jackson bleach but to get us back to the baseline. yes we have some wonderful products that are available today all basically from good research.	is there a way an olive skin person can have a chemical peel?

no. an itchy ear is likely to be a problem in the external ear canal not a healing eardrum. however the drainage from the rupture could have caused some inflammation resulting in some itching. keep things out of your ears especially q-tips. if you are a q-tip user removing the protective earwax can make you ears more prone to infections and yes. itching. until your eardrum is totally healed it is not a good idea to get water in it either.	is an itchy ear a sign of my eardrum healing? . i was diagnosed with a ear infection and given amoxicillin to treat it. the nexy day my eardrum ruptured and a clear yet somewhat bloody fluid drained from my ear. my ear has been a little itchy and it gives me these twitches every once in a while. by the way i'm 15.

suturing (stitching) a surgical site in the mouth is necessary to limit tissue movement and to help keep it in the right place. however many times it is not required. as a matter of fact in certain instances it might work against the proper healing process. leave the decision to the surgeon. if you are going to a properly trained person they will know what is best to do in your situation.	while getting my wisdom teeth removed they will cut the gums but say stitches aren't needed. is that ok?
the way you should handle diarrhea in a 3 month old really depends on how much and how often he is having the diarrhea. in many cases pedialyte is not necessary and babies can continue to have their regular formula or breast milk. in more severe cases things like pedialyte might be recommended. since young babies can become dehydrated more easily than anolder child it's a good idea to have your baby seen by your pediatrician to make sure he is not losing too much weight and fluid from the diarrhea. make sure not to give him any over-the-counter diarrhea medicines as these can be very harmful to babies and children.	my 3 month old has diarrhea and i don't know what i should do. is it okay to give him pedialite?
"fibromyalgia and its chronic pain can affect sex and intimacy. fm affects everything else so why shouldn't it cause unique problems with sex and intimacy as well? fm introduces new fears concerns and anxieties into a relationship and we must understand them and address them. first understanding the unique problems fm causes with sex: 1. pain. the physiological equivalent of a cold shower! we hurt all over and any pressure or weight or squeezing aggravates the pain. sex is not supposed to hurt. 2. fatigue. no energy = less sexually active. mental fatigue = decreased motivation = loss of libido = less sexually active. the person with fm may go to bed several hours before the partner and be asleep by the time the partner gets into bed. it is difficult to have successful sexual intimacy when one person is asleep! since sleep is so valuable and so short-lived for many with fibro any deep sleep will be more desired than sex esp[ecially] at 11:30 pm! 3. associated conditions. ibs can cause nausea abdominal pains and more bowel alertness than sexual alertness. depression can cause additional loss of libido interest and motivation. anxiety can interfere with sexual responses. poor self esteem can lead to lack of interest or embarrassment. 4. medicine side effects. ssris can decrease libido or cause sexual dysfunctions including ed [erectile dysfunction] in men. muscle relaxers tricyclics and antiseizure meds can cause extreme sedation. different meds can cause nausea or gi [gastrointestinal] symptoms and shift the focus from the bedroom to the bathroom. so with so much ""negative stuff"" going on with fibro how do we possibly figure out a way to enjoy sex? we focus on the positives of sex rather than the problems. we reassure ourselves that intimacy is good for you your relationship and your fibro. sex can be therapeutic. let's count the ways. 1. it is a physical activity. isn't physical activity good for fibro? ! 2. it increases our body's endorphins. 3. it improves blood flow removes toxins from cells and boosts our immune system. 4. it results in stretching and then relaxation of our muscles. 5. it reduces stress. 6. it re-connects us emotionally and intimately. 7. usually we forget about pain during sexual intimacy! we should reassure ourselves that we are not hurting ourselves by being intimate; rather we are helping both the fibro and the relationship. your partner is also dealing with fears and anxieties about hurting you so you both need to be reassured about the positive aspects of being intimate."	how does fibromyalgia affect sex and intimacy and how can we address these problems?
it is very common for all men and women to experience small aches and pains due to muscoloskeletal issues or tissue wear and tear. the analysis of your history and symptoms do not indicate that you have serious neurological issues like als. this is true since all the tests including the mri have been found to be normal. the other possibilities would be that you have a low threshold to pain or they could be due to psychological issues. conditions like fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndromes might also be a possibility. it would be recommended that you consult a rheumatologist and a psychiatrist who can help with proper diagnosis and also proper counseling and behavior management to help you manage and live with the pain. i hope this helps.	last year my right hand often had the cramp from the shoulder until the fingertips. 4 months later my back felt slightly painful like period pain's. 3 months after that the pain went upwards until the end of my neck near to my head it was painful to raise my head up. this year 3 weeks before my chest started to feel heavy and hurtful. both of my back and chest felt as if shards of glasses were slashing along the ribs and spine. short of breath most of the time. now my right leg the calf is having some sort of muscle cramp along the bone just like how it is like with my back. i was told by friends that i walked unstably but i don't drag it though. sometimes forgetful and emotionally unstable. maybe due to the stress. cannot sit or stand or lay down for too long. i'm getting thinner and lost 5 kg i eat a lot. went for mri xray blood test urine test nothing next appointment i'm going to have brain mri and emg. any possibility of me having als? what is wrong with me?

1. spend time in nature. sun exposure and natural light have been found to increase your mood. take a break during the day and be sure to step outside or go near a window to get your dose of mood-enhancing light. pay attention to the colors in nature when you’re outdoors. what sounds do you hear? looking around your environment with a fresh pair of eyes can be a very relaxing experience. 2. move your body. the current recommendations for physical activity call for sixty minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise daily. sound daunting? make it fun! go for a walk as a family turn on the radio and dance or practice yoga balance poses. movement activities positively affect health by reducing blood pressure enhancing mood and strengthening bones. 3. laugh. laughter really is the best medicine. take a moment to remember a situation that you found humorous. as you vividly recall the details you’ll probably find that a smile spontaneously develops. tell jokes make funny faces or start laughing and see who laughs with you. it can be contagious! 4. express yourself creatively. expressive art therapy enables you to share inner thoughts or feelings when they are difficult to articulate verbally. engaging in art activities such as finger painting drawing coloring etc. may relieve feelings of anxiety. 5. listen to music. there are many benefits to listening to music from relaxation to enhancing sleep. 6. take a warm bath. there are many historical references to the healing properties of water. ancient spas originated near mineral springs and seas and were used by natural healers to support health. establishing a bedtime routine that includes a warm bath in a quiet room can help to promote sleep and feelings of calm after a long day. run a warm bath light a few candles and close the door to spend some quality time with you. 7. aromatherapy. this refers to the use of essential oils to improve health and wellbeing. oils are delivered to the body through inhalation or direct application to the skin. lavender lemon balm and sandalwood are the two most common oils used to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. add a few drops to bath water or on a pillowcase. rub the oils between the palms of your hands and cup your hands to inhale a few deep breaths of the scent. use with caution if you have asthma or a skin condition associated with allergies. consult a physician before use. 8. gratitude journal. when we’re faced with life’s challenges we often see only the stressful situation and lose sight of all that we have to be thankful for in our lives. the next time life seems to hand you lemons try making lemonade by writing down ten things you appreciate in your life. it won’t eliminate the stress but you may find that it helps to improve your mood and shift your perspective allowing you to see new possibilities to resolve stressful situations. 9. gentle massage. human touch is very powerful and can be quite nurturing. use a lotion or light massage oil to rub the feet and/or hands. there are numerous “points” on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet that may influence various systems within the body. a gentle massage can be both relaxing and stimulating. use this technique to help quell stress when it appears. 10. mindful breathing. the mind has a tendency to wander. our thoughts pull us into the past replaying moments that we can’t recover or push us into the future as we worry about what has yet to come. the body is always in the present moment. noticing your breathing on purpose without feeling the need to change it brings us back to the present moment. it serves as an anchor. take a “time-out” to notice your breathing when you feel stressed or worried and pay attention to how your body feels.	what are some healthy ways to help me manage my stress levels?
the answer is: not necessarily. the birth control pill isn't considered completely effective until it's been taken for a full month. your health care provider should have explained this to you before you received your first package of pills. since you had unprotected sex before the first month was up you should call your health care provider to find out if you should continue taking the pills as directed. taking birth control pills while pregnant is not a good idea. your health care provider can advise you as to your best course of action. you also need to be aware that birth control pills only work to prevent pregnancy. they do not protect you against sexually transmitted diseases so you still need to practice safe sex with a condom. hope this helps!	i just started birth control for the first time. i took seven pills and on the 8th day i had sex. was i protected?

legg calves perthes disease. can affect the hip joint in children usually presenting with relatively mild but persistent hip thigh or knee pain. initial treatment especially for younger children is observation and rest. the long-term prognosis is good especially when this occurs at a younger age as in this case. care should be managed by an orthopedist who after a period of rest and observation will probably be able to allow gradually more and more activities. most kids with lcp can ride bikes though he'll work up to that as his condition improves. i don't know of any diet changes or supplements that are likely to help. since he'll be relatively sedentary for at least a little while and spending more time indoors you will want to make sure he's getting enough calcium and vitamin d.	are there any supplements that can help improve my 5 year old's early-stage lcpd (legg calves perthes disease)?

you need to become an expert in herpes so i am giving you some homework. <link> basically herpes is definitely contagious during an active outbreak on the lip (cold sores) or the genitals but since many people have contracted herpes when their partners do not have active lesions it is possible to catch it even during those asymptomatic dormant periods. if your boyfriend has genital lesions condoms offer good but not 100% protection as you will read.

virtually all viruses are contagious. if you are susceptible. adults tend to carry a certain level of immunity to many viruses (and there are hundreds of them) so exposure does not necessarily mean you will catch it. or even have the same viral response. respiratory viruses are usually contagious a day before you know you are sick and for two days afterward. since i do not know the bug that has plagued your other family members i can't address your issue specifically but time with family is important. and sometimes you just have to take a chance. we all take chances going out the grocery store or restaurants but we go anyway.	we are spending a weekend with family members who have just recovered from colds. are they still contagious?
knowing when you are about to release your egg can help decrease stress and increase the effectiveness of trying to conceive. while sperm can survive for up to 6 days in the female body eggs survive twelve hours. therefore most pregnancies occur when sperm are waiting for the egg. while babies have been conceived with acts of intercourse up to 6 days prior to ovulation the hightest chance of conception is within the two days prior to ovulation. learning to interpret your body's signals can help you find your fertility. cervical mucus. as the egg approaches ovulation increasing amounts of estrogen are produced and cervical mucus becomes sticky or stringy like egg whites. consistency changes as the water content of the mucus increases making penetration by sperm easier. cervical mucus changes can be identified up to 6 days prior to ovulation. timing intercourse when you notice your cervical mucus changing can be effective in helping you to conceive. ovulation predictor kits. opks detect luteinizing hormone (lh) or both lh and estradiol. as the egg moves closer to ovulation estradiol rises. while estradiol rises lh is released in increasing quantities then drops creating the lh surge that precedes egg release by 24-48 hours. to use an opk you urinate on the wick daily and look at the test kit window. with most kits one line means urine made it into the kit and two lines means lh is detected. kits that detect both estradiol and lh read low peak when estradiol only is detected and high peak when both estradiol and lh is detected. if you are able to detect the surge on the kit intercourse the day of the surge and the day after the surge should provide sperm for the arriving egg. basal body tempteratures once the egg is released progesterone is produced. progesterone increases body temperature. therefore your temperature goes up after ovulation. the best time to take your temperature is before you get out of bed in the morning. if you chart your temperature daily you should see at least an 0. 3 degree rise in the baseline temperature the day after ovulation. temperature should stay up until shortly before the period. if you have conceived your temperature will stay up during pregnancy. unlike cervical mucus changes and ovulation predictor kits basal body temperatures do not let you know that you are about to ovulate. rather they tell you that you have. so if you want to use them to time intercourse you need to chart for a month to see when you ovulated and then plan to have intercourse in the cycle days prior to the temperature rise during the next month. since menstrual cycles can be different from month to month this method can be frustrating to some. once you have seen that there is a temperature rise and that your temperature stays up for approximately 2 weeks you may wish to stop checking daily temperatures to decrease the stress of trying to conceive. if however you find the daily temperatures reassuring feel free to continue. don't worry. not all women can detect all of the signs of ovulation. follow whichever of the signs works for you. if you are unable to detect any of the changes discussed here you may not be ovulating. see your physician to make the final determination with a blood test for progesterone timed one week after the surge on your opk or rise in temperature which should be one week before your period. if you are not ovulating your physician can try to determine the cause and give you medications to help you release your egg. if the thought of testing for ovulation is frustrating to you intercourse two to three times a week should cover your fertile window.	how can i tell when i am most fertile?

there is really no way for a medical professional to blindly determine a healing time based solely with the information you provided in your posting. healing time is very individual -- especially when you have osteopenia. healing time depends on your age the severity of the infection the degree of displacement and a dozen other variables. sometimes there is a non-union. a fracture that will not fuse without some help and unfortunately this help is often surgically. stabilizing a fracture with a pin may be recommended but the good news is that the fibula is not a weight bearing bone so the orthopedist may recommend waiting longer. perhaps a month more to see if nature takes care of it.	how long does it take a displaced fracture of the fibula to heal? . i broke my fibula about 6 weeks ago: it is displaced broke in 3 places at the tip. the swelling has almost gone down and it seems like it is healing. last time i got x-rays {2 weeks ago} it was still displaced. i have osteopenia and take 1000 mg of calcium a day. don't want surgery do you think it will heal without? if so how long?

not necessarily but you can certainly call your doctor for patient-specific advice. breast fed babies (i don't know what you are doing) can go many days without a bowel movement. there is not much fiber in breast milk. formula may be no different. a baby can go 8 times a day or once every 8 days. it does not mean they are constipated. seasoned parents usually find this out; new parents (you? ) may not have this experience. constipation is hard dry stools and it is very unlikely that this is what is going on. you are concerned so just call your doctor for some advice.	5 week old baby hasn't had poopy daiper in almost 3 days should i take her to the docotors?

first it’s good to be concerned and thoughtful about how you will please your partner – just don’t get too worried about it; approaching it with relaxation and ease is more productive for you. second try practicing edging for a couple of weeks. edging involves masturbating right up until the point of ejaculating then stopping before the ejaculation occurs; letting the urge to ejaculate subside; then masturbating to the edge again; and repeating this over and over without ejaculating for as long as you can – at least half an hour. doing this every day for 2-3 weeks helps many men learn control over their ejaculations when with a partner. it also gives them a sore red penis but using a quality penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) that includes both vitamin e (a natural hydrator) and she abutter (an excellent emollient) can help reduce the soreness.	i ejaculation in 2-3 mins is it normal? please advice some useful tips n med if nessesary. i am getting married soon and i found when i masturbate i become excited to much and cum in no time please tell me how to increase time for intercourse? exercise medicine diet all guide will be appreciated.

what’s interesting about that is women in general although their bodies actually get better sleep than men historically when we look in the data they only get better sleep for short periods of time. because everything starts when the menstrual cycle begins. so when the woman’s menstrual cycle begins i’ve got patients who are really sleepy a week before their period and i’ve got women who have insomnia the week before their period. i have women who are really sleeping during their period and women who have insomnia during their period. so it’s very individualized based on your menstrual cycle and that ebb and flow is going to occur over the course of the 28 to 30 day cycle that you’re going to have throughout your entire life. then women may or may not become pregnant. that’s a whole other ball game when it comes to sleep. a lot of women are absolutely exhausted during their first trimester or have insomnia trimester. the second trimester is usually the area where women are able to fall asleep a little bit better but by the time they have their third trimester they are so uncomfortable and they can’t get into a good position that they don’t get good sleep then. now we’re talking about after the baby has come. well all bets are pretty much off once the baby has shown up especially if you’re breast feeding because then you’ve got more sleep deprivation because children are waking up needing to be fed and things of that nature. so again women have the pretty bad deal when it comes to sleep over the course of that section of their lives. when we move past that whether or not you sleep during your children’s teenage years may be another factor of your child and then you start to get into menopause. and then we’ve got significant hormonal changes that are going to cause sleepiness in some people and insomnia in others. primarily we see a lot of insomnia. there’s only been one or two studies that have looked at sleep aides with women who are going through menopause and they’ve actually shown some pretty good results in that women who are going through menopause can take some of these sleep medications and do pretty well.	how does my menstrual cycle affect my sleep?
no your doctor will most likely not be able to tell if you have been pregnant in the past by doing an exam. however it is of utmost importance that you tell your doctor about you complete medical and surgical history because it can affect your current pregnancy in significant ways. in addition it is important that you tell your doctor at your first visit. you may want to speak with the doctor first and then invite your mom in or talk to the doctor first with your mom in the room and then have her step out when the exam is done so that you can tell your doctor then. another way would be to see your doctor for your initial exam without her and then invite her to your first ultrasound. realize that the information in your medical record is completely confidential unless you indicate that it is okay to speak with specific people about it.	can a doctor tell if you've had an abortion or been previously pregnant during a vaginal exam for a new pregnancy? . i had an abortion and am now pregnant again. i had it a year ago - i had a surgical abortion and was 11 weeks along. my mother is going with me to my first exam. i don't want her to know. can a doctor tell if i've had an abortion or been pregnant before just by looking and feeling? i didn't have my abortion in the state so i wouldn't think they would have my medical files about it. i plan on telling the doctor later about the abortion but my mom will be with me in the room for the first exam.
there can be many causes for a baby’s fever. dehydration is one. or the infant might be over-bundled with clothes in a relatively warm environment. the rule of thumb is to dress your baby in just one more layer of clothing than you are comfortable in. most commonly fever is caused by an infection. the body’s immune system senses the “foreign invader” - such as bacteria or a virus - and sends a chemical message to the brain’s temperature center instructing it to crank up the heat inside the body. this has many advantages: some bacteria and viruses don’t like the higher temperature and are then more easily destroyed by the immune system. the higher body temperature helps the body to ward off the infection. in this way fever is actually our friend: it lets us know that an infection may be brewing and it helps to fight off the infection.	what causes a fever in babies?

i don't know. i never had the opportunity to reach a personal limit (which in most cases is considerably less than what your mind creates). sex like any physical activity can border on being addictive. i have known runnersand cyclists that were so addicted to the high from running/cycling that the could not stop even for a day. if your sexual activity is interfering with your daily activities or the activities of your partner(s) then it could be a problem for you. people can be obsessively hypersexual for sure like a nymphomaniac. if your hypersexual activity is risky (multiple partners unsafe practices etc. ) then you may need some professional help. if you are just having a active sex life with a willing partner then consider yourself a very lucky person.	is it possible to have too much sex?

a few problems with your story. 1. fever is harmless; both the 103 and the 100. it is unlikely that an experienced physician would do anything. fever is more beneficial and does not need to be treated at all. 2. mono is a virus and it is not treatable either	how would an emergency aid physician handle a 100 degree fever in a three year-old. so i'm a novelist trying to figure out a hospital scene in my latest work. my character has just taken her son to the hospital because they both have fevers of over 100 (she is at 100 her three year-old is at 103) and she is basically in a panic. . they both have mono (the mother had it first and transferred it to her son unknowingly) and i've done research to find how a doctor would treat this. what i need to know is how the physician would break the fever. . thank you very much.

yes it is possible. endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (blood tests for diagnosing celiac disease) are highly reliable in diagnosing celiac disease. an individual with abnormally elevated endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. anti-gliadin antibodies are less reliable and have a higher rate of false positive tests. there are two recognized reasons for false negative blood tests for celiac disease: patients with deficiency of one type of antibody iga (they are born that way) will have low endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies since they are iga-type antibodies. patients who have self-treated themselves with a gluten-free diet for weeks to months before having these tests done can have abnormal blood tests revert to normal.	is it possible to have a false negative blood test for celiac disease?

"most helpful answer hi bipolar disorder formerly known as manic depression is a condition that affects your moods which can swing from one extreme to another. depression – where you feel very low and lethargic. mania – where you feel very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania) symptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you are experiencing. unlike simple mood swings each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer) and some people may not experience a ""normal"" mood very often. schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms including: hallucinations - hearing or seeing things that do not exist. delusions - unusual beliefs not based on reality which often contradict the evidence. muddled thoughts based on the hallucinations or delusions. changes in behaviour. doctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness. do hope this is what you want. good luck"	what is the difference between bi-polar and schizophrenia?

most helpful answer see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. you may not know the reason(s) you are crying and not feeling well but a medical provider would likely have more insight. this complicated matter cannot be solved blindly over the internet so please do the right thing and see a medical professional.	18 years old crying for no reason i'm sick. this morning i woke up to take a shower and there was no hot water so i started crying? i also have a headache and i feel like throwing up. this has happened the last couple of sundays at work. i always feel this way in the morning when i do feel it. on top of that i've had a stuffy nose and bad cough for 4 weeks. it's gotten better but it won't go away. and my ears are clogged. then last night i notice that certain smells get me light headed.
most helpful answer the penis is covered with skin and skin can itch for a variety of reasons. without an examination it would only be a blind guess to know the specific reason for your itching. it could be soap. laundry detergents or dryer softeners in your underwear causing an allergic reaction. it could be fungal (fungus loves warm dark moist areas). simple itching. not due to fungus. can be treated with 1% hydrocortisone cream over the counter. a fungal infection would require an anti-fungal cream available over the counter. since you cannot be diagnosed over the internet based solely on you very brief posting consider getting a proper examination if any of these suggestions are not helping.	why does my penis itch? ive never had sex. ok so recently i masturbated and i think it was a little to rough as my penis did get a little red the problem is now my penis itchs i think becuse the skin is healing but idk. ive never had a cold sore or had any sighs of harpies. my penis looks fine except for one red line in the middle.

what you're describing sounds like typical positioning for the laparascopic oopherectomy. as a former surgical nurse i helped position plenty of patients as you describe. i can't think of any reason why this positioning would aggravate your cervical spine or cause back spasms because the downward gravitational force on the spine while in the lithotomy position with trendelenburg (with the feet elevated 15-30 degrees) is lower than the force on the spine when walking for example. certainly if your surgeon anesthesiologist or circulating rn thought the positioning would aggravate your spine issues they would not have done it. in the operating room we take positioning extremely seriously are very careful regarding these issues. so sorry to hear you're dealing with the back issues and hope you can get yourself fixed up soon!	is trendleburg position advisible for abdominal surgery on patients with cervical herniated discs. i recently had laprascopic surgery for ovary removal i have previously had an acdf on c5 /c6 but reinjured and discs are symptomatic i also have t6 t7 large protrusions when i woke from surgery i was in spasm and 7 weeks later am still in a lot of pain - i think it was due to the position i was in during surgery; i was put into lithotomy position withmy upper body in trendleburg position. is this advisible for someone with my spinal injuries?

check out the usda label and look specifically where it says “carbohydrate ” and look under it. you’ll see a breakdown of sugars and fiber. if the product says “20 grams of carb” and underneath it says “15 grams of sugar ” run. it’s jam-packed with sugar and has a high gi. 4 grams of refined sugar is equal to 1 tsp. every tsp increases your risk for heart disease. check out the cereal you’re eating in the morning. avoid the frosted stuff as well as those loaded with granola raisins and dates. added sugars in your diet mount up over time and if you’re not vigilant you’ll be consuming way too much of the white stuff. there are several good gi food list books out there as well as multiple websites where you can learn for yourself what the gi is for carbs you’re currently eating. as a rule of thumb try to stick to foods that are less than 50 (low gi) or 55-70 (medium gi) and avoid or minimize high gi (>70) food products.	how can i know if a food has a high glycemic index (gi)?

it’s the bottom of the ninth. the bases are loaded with two outs. your favorite mlb team is pitching. who do you want on the mound? a recent research study would indicate that you should take his sleep habits into account before answering. a recent study presented at the 24th annual meeting of the associated professional sleep society looked at just this question. the results indicate that there appear to be two big factors for that pitcher on the mound: * is he a morning lark or a night owl? * is it a day or night game? the researchers found that pitchers who were morning types (“early birds”) as indicated on a special questionnaire performed better than those who are “night owls” overall. in the early games (those that began before 7 p. m. ) the era for pitchers who were early birds was 3. 06 while the era for the night owls was 3. 49. however if the game was in the evening (7 p. m. or later) night owl pitchers were only slightly better with an era of 4. 07 then early bird pitchers with an era of 4. 15. this research also reinforces the thought that peak physical performance is typically best for most athletes between mid-afternoon and early evening (before 7 p. m. ). the study involved eighteen pitchers from five mlb teams including: the la dodgers ny mets philadelphia phillies sf giants and the tampa bay rays. the researchers used data from a total of 1 573 innings pitched during the 2009 season and were able to account for jet lag (i. e. time zone change). so what does this mean for the boys of summer? well not only does the early bird catch the worm but he also seems to strike out the batter!	how do my sleep habits affect my waking hours?
how much coversyl (perindopril) and starpress (metoprolol) you are taking? have you confirmed the readings twice? if your bp is low then you certainly need to reduce the dosage of either coversyl or starpress. let me know the dosage so that we can modify it. also monitor your blood pressure thrice a day for one week and once or twice. if such low bp occurs then you can have salt and sugar water to raise it. i guess you did not have any chest pain or heaviness. in short there is no need to worry. we will just reduce the dosage and also space out the drugs like one in the morning and other in the evening. you discuss these issues with your doctor. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,Every time my blood pressure will be in the range of 160/110 mmHg or 150/100 mmHg.

i'm sorry to hear what you went through. mrsa can be a very nasty bug indeed. as you probably know (but for the benefit of others reading this response) mrsa stands for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureas. this bacterium is resistant to treatment by many antibiotics. thankfully vancomycin still works to kill it. i understand your concern about the infection coming back. you are not being paranoid in thinking this way. usually the iv vancomycin treatment completely eradicates the bug but not always. here are things you should watch for: fever over 101. 3f localized heat in any joint but especially on the finger or hand where the mrsa originally was colonized localized swelling especially on the originally affected hand swollen hot angry red tissue -- especially on the originally affected hand any of those signs should send you quickly back to your treating physician. while i noted you should mainly focus your attention on the hand that was originally infected don't ignore other limbs. basically if you get any weird symptoms -- whether around your knee or in the opposite arm or whatever -- you should check back with your healthcare provider. also if your physician agrees it wouldn't hurt to have your sed (sedimentation) rate monitored for awhile. this blood test basically measures inflammation in your body. people with a serious infection like mrsa have an elevated sed rate. in some people who have had mrsa the sed rate remains elevated for a long time and it's nothing to worry about. but it's a test infectious disease professionals routinely look at in people who have or had mrsa. chances are you will never have a problem with mrsa again but you're wise to stay vigilant for awhile. and if you ever decide to have joint replacement surgery pacemaker implantation or any surgery that puts hardware into your body be sure to mention your mrsa history to your surgeon. wishing you well!	i had mrsa that penetrated bone in what ways will mrsa reapear what do i look for to prevent another serious ocurance? . bone infection was removed from finger. underwent surgery and 6 weeks of vancomycin iv treatment. i am an otherwise very healthy 32 yr old woman.
no. a positive drug test is still a positive drug test. urine is used as the standard not blood.	how long does benzos stay in your system for? . i have a friend who hasn't taking any benzos in over 30 days but she still tested positive with a urine test. would a blood test show different results?
"alcohol as you know is a highly addictive substance and repeated use can lead to oral cancer. baking soda has some benefits but is too abrasive to use regularly. get ""addicted"" to an ada approved toothpaste. craved foods or non-foods = body desperate for missing minerals. eating craved items fails to get minerals the system needs increasing use to perceived ""addiction"". body ""knows"" what's needed seeks what resembles? what's missing. could be salt sugar etc. too. older cultures ate special clays for this: problem solved! pregnant mothers sought special clays--probably higher in magnesium to counter eclampsia. others chose different clays. many have used mezotrace or simply kelp snacks to fix this; either of these have all the minerals in good balance. even just eating lots of veggies helps. mezotrace is a fine powder sprinkles on food usually at health food stores. kelp snacks are sold in lots of stores now--tasty! you will most probably stop craving baking soda once your body gets it's needed minerals. most do; amounts differ per person. one sister literally snowed on her dinner plate with salt; took fresh veggies lost the salt shaker. get needed nutrients only that it does and craves sources of minerals strongly enough to drive serious cravings. i cannot explain how a body knows what to seek out just that it does but often fails to get them due to mans' manipulation of our food sources over time. various clays have been used for this supplementation for thousands of years."	i have become addicted to brushing my teeth with baking soda and rubbing alcohol. are there any dangers to this?

the only true method to determine who may be the father is by having a paternity test. but if your friends remembers when she had sexual relations with these two men it is possible to make a pretty accurate determination of paternity within a 10 day period. for example if the baby were to be born on october 18 2014 (case #1) then the probable range of conception would have been january 21 2014- january 29 2014 if the baby was born on october 1 2014 (case #2) then the probable range of conception would be january 4- january - january 12 2014. in case # 1 if sex occurred on january 23rd with man # 2 and on january 12th with man # 1 then man # 2 is the likely father. in case # 2 if sex occurred on january 6th with man # 1 and on january 18th with man # 2 then man # 1 would be the likely father. the doctor who confirmed your friend's pregnancy can provide an expected due date and also provide the probable date range for conception. there are also computer programs available on the internet which can also make the determination. all that is needed is the expected due date and the dates on which sex occurred with the two men.	friend is pregnant but she doesn't know if it's her friend or her fiance baby. my friend is currently pregnant and she doesn't know if the baby is her friends or fiance and shes upset and she wants to know before the baby is born and is there a way she can find out because her fiance doesn't know please help on what to do and what to tell my friend

"osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis that is caused by the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints. cartilage is a protein substance that serves as a ""cushion"" between the bones of the joints. osteoarthritis is also known as degenerative arthritis. among the over 100 different types of arthritis conditions osteoarthritis is the most common affecting over 20 million people in the united states. osteoarthritis occurs more frequently as we age. before age 45 osteoarthritis occurs more frequently in males. after 55 years of age it occurs more frequently in females. in the united states all races appear equally affected. a higher incidence of osteoarthritis exists in the japanese population while south-african blacks east indians and southern chinese have lower rates. osteoarthritis commonly affects the hands feet spine and large weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees. most cases of osteoarthritis have no known cause and are referred to as primary osteoarthritis. when the cause of the osteoarthritis is known the condition is referred to as secondary osteoarthritis. osteoarthritis is sometimes abbreviated oa."	what is osteoarthritis?

fillers should not be thought of as a substitute for surgery. a patient who needs a face and neck lift will have sagginess around the jowls and jaw line and a hanging neck. none of that can be improved with fillers. while surgery may be appropriate to help tighten the mid and lower face it does that only to a limited degree. overaggressive surgical treatment will result in that terrible windblown overdrawn “i-was-strapped-to-a-747? look. and that result is very difficult to undo. as fillers are not a substitute for surgery the reverse is true as well. surgery can’t take the place of fillers. but we need to be realistic about what non-surgical techniques such as fillers whether they be permanent or semi-permanent can do with respect to improving the entire appearance. remember the neck and the eyes are the areas that are the tipoffs to aging. and while fillers such as restylane juvederm hydrelle perlane zyderm zyplast cosmoderm cosmoplast sculptra radiesse and even fat and liquid silicone can do great things around the face and i certainly endorse them they don’t answer the problem of the jowls the saggy neck the hanging platysma edges the double chin and upper neck and jaw fat. only surgery is the salvation there. experienced cosmetic plastic surgeons will guide you as to the best choices or combination of treatment. as i’ve said many a time one shoe does not fit all.	can fillers replace plastic surgery?
probably what happened is what’s called a penile fracture. it really isn’t a break like the break of a bone. but there’s two chambers within the penis that hold the blood the corpora cavernosa. and it’s a very thin-walled structure that becomes very distended very tense and that’s where the rigidity of the erection occurs. in certain rare circumstances the torqueing the stretch on that is enough to pop and crack one of those chambers. classically the man will experience severe excruciating pain sudden disappearance of the erection horrible pain with blood the penis will become purple cracking sound and close but almost excruciating pain and that’s a surgical emergency. they have to stop what they’re doing and go immediately to the emergency room. it may require surgical intervention. the risk of that is because of the risk of the scar from the healing of the tear men can end up with curvature and even permanent impotence. the good news is it’s fairly rare almost always occurs in very aggressive wild sex usually women on top what happens is the penis comes out vaginal vault but goes back in and misses hits the pubic bone in the woman and that’s enough for the organ to pop.	i heard a crack while having sex and now i’ve lost my erection.

mono can cause the liver and/or spleen to enlarge to the point that it is vulnerable to a blunt injury not uncommon in soccer. assuming that she does not have liver or spleen enlargement and her liver enzymes (a blood test) are normal she may be able to play. the doctor really should not have left it up to you. i agree. this is really a medical decision based on physical exam findings. mono can be mild. and mono can be very problematic so unfortunately without knowing the details of her particular case and of course those critical physical examination and lab findings you will need to put the ball back in the doctor's court to make this decision. yes she can. mononucleosis usually isn't very serious. it may subside on its own. in some cases they become immune to the disease. you may start her with herbs that increase general immunity like tinospora curcuma and triphala powder all in equal quantity at dose of 3 gms twice daily.	daughter tested positive for mono. the only symptom is swollen lymph nodes in her neck. can she play soccer? . she has no fever no swollen spleen no sore throat no fatigue. dr left it up to us whether or not she should play! just want to hear other opinions.

obviously i do not know your wife's medical history and breast cancer risks nor can i examine her and view those mammogram results but i can probably back-up the surgeon's decision. mammograms are not perfect. the only way to get a 100% assurance that this calcification is truly benign is by a pathological specimen. examining it carefully under a microscope by a train pathologist. even a biopsy (a small piece of this calcification) can be wrong so a excisional biopsy is often the best way to go. this way the entire calcified area is removed and examined. if this tissue is benign that you will know conclusively that this area is not cancer you and your wife can relax and will not have to worry that the mammogram missed something. in medicine we have a saying: gone is good. that calcification is now gone it was not cancer and this is good.	is it normal to have benign breast calcification surgically removed? . my wife had the biopsy done and was told that the calcification were benign we had a consultation with a surgeon and they said that even though the test results came back as benign she should still go ahead and have the calcification surgically removed since there is still a chance that tests were wrong even if its almost a non existential chance that the test were wrong. is it normal to have benign breast calcification surgically removed?
that is pretty odd to have occurred as many times in one year as it has. i had pink eye once in my life and never since. it might have to do with washing necessary materials where your eye comes close or in contact with when you have pinkeye. i know i caught strep throat at college 3 times in one semester because i forgot to change my toothbrush once and didn't wash my sheets the second time so maybe close approximation to objects has been keeping the bacteria in close proximity to certain living spaces you reside often. xbox controllers and so on should be wiped down with clorox antibacterial wipes to disinfect any bacteria. hope this helps	pinkeye. i have gotten pinkeye 5 times in the last year and a half. before that i can't remember the last time i had it. it only occurs in my left eye and no one (i know) has ever gotten it from me. i've been to the doctor for it and they keep telling me its just pinkeye and its probably not bacterial and i'll be okay. but it keeps coming back and its really bothersome.

most helpful answer not having a fallopian tube can indeed decrease your chances of getting pregnant. assuming your right ovary is still working the lack of a fallopian tube on that side means any egg put out by the ovary has nowhere to go. that means you can only get pregnant when your left ovary is putting out an egg. obviously you can't control which ovary puts out an egg in any given month. your best bet is to consult your gynecologist for specific information about your case. he or she may be able to refer you to an infertility specialist for some kind of treatment. i wish you all the best!	i'm trying to get pregnant from last 3 months. i dont have right felopian tube does it affect to get pregnant? wt do i do?
i'm sorry you're going through this and hope you have sought medical treatment. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose a condition like this without a physical exam. many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe. a medical professional needs to see this and possibly run some additional tests in order to figure out what's going on. meanwhile be extremely careful not to touch surfaces or other people while the rash on your hands is active. wear light gloves if possible to keep from spreading whatever this may be to others. i hope you get a diagnosis and feel better soon!	itchy palms and fingers bilaterally_turned to multiple tender blisters over past 12 hr_now tender blisters back of neck

no. that’s not right. the provision of the health reform law that allows adult children to stay on their parents’ health plan applies to all insurers. the right to keep your adult child on your insurance plan until age 26 is a federal law that went into effect last year as a result of health reform. though there will be aspects of the new law with which self-funded plans will not be required to comply this provision is not one of them. by law you are allowed to keep your adult child on your health plan. other provisions with which self-funded plans will need to comply include preventive services with no cost sharing and no lifetime or annual limits on coverage. if you are a young person looking for health insurance or a parent looking on behalf of your child check out this previous post about finding health insurance for young adults. and for more information about extending insurance to young adults here’s a helpful question/answer write-up by the u. s. department of health and human services.	my company said our plan is self-funded and kids can't stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26. are they right?

this is a great question. when patients come in or consumers and ask me about heartburn as a pharmacist i have to ask them a few questions to find out what kind of heartburn are they having. for instance if they are having heartburn at night they really need to see a physician. i need to find out how frequently they are having their heartburn. if they are having it everyday or is it only one or two times a week? then i need to ask them some questions about their diet because what they may not understand is that diet caffeine acidic foods even smoking could lead to heartburn. then i will look at them and say okay are they taking any other medications? my elderly patients hopefully they have their medication list with them. i will be able to take a look and see what's appropriate for them. there are a variety of different products that are available. if it's just something for quick relief then you could use like an antacid like a maalox or a tums something along those lines. if it's something that maybe needs a little bit more consistency then we can go more towards a pepcid type of product which works a little differently by cutting down on the amount of acid in the stomach. if they complain that they have had it more frequently during the day for a number of days then the choice might be something like prilosec otc which they are going to take for about 14 days. if they come back to the pharmacy after that and the 14 days and it hasn't worked then i am going refer them back to their physician or their healthcare provider for further evaluation.	how do i choose an over-the-counter heartburn medication?
if she is in her ovulation period then better to take an emergency contraceptive pill. ovulation occurs 14 days prior to the expected menses. imagine her periods is of 28 days then unsafe days are from 11th day of menses to 20th day. ovulation is unpredictable as the cycles of menses. so such a long unsafe period for extra safety. if you had sex before 11 days and after 20 days of first menstrual day then chances of pregnancy are very less. you need not take i-pill. if not then take i-pill at the earliest. for further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I had unprotected intercourse this morning.

if the boy parts touch the girl parts whether you ejaculate or not there is always a small chance that pregnancy could occur. sperm can be viable in the clear mucous that emits from your penis during sexual excitation. the chance is very remote however so i think you are good. this time. if your girlfriend is also having sex with someone else that would be a different story. having a little scare like this is good practice if you continue with your risky sex-play you are eventually going to have sex. why not try and prevent it? your partner should be on an effective method of birth control and you should be wearing a condom. an erect penis is a loaded weapon my worried friend.	could my girlfriend be pregnant? . so last week my girlfriend and i laid naked in bed. we didn't have sex we did touch each other and i didn't not ejaculate. my gf told me that she has missed her period and she is worried that she may be pregnant. i told here that there was no way sense i did not penetrate her and i did not ejaculate. as a precaution i went to the drug store and bought her levonorgestrel a hormone that is used to prevent pregnancy. is there anyway possible that she could have gotten pregnant?

we usually recommend antiepileptic if someone has two seizures within 24 hours. in approximately 70% cases we may not be able to identify any specific cause for seizures for example - infection stroke focal cortical dysplasia (fcd) and tumor as in your case. sinusitis is an incidental finding and at present it seems to be unrelated to epilepsy. you should complete antibiotic course as prescribed for its coverage. for epilepsy he will need antiepileptic drugs (aed). there are many aed to choose from but once you have been given keppra (levetiracetam) you can continue the same as it is a new generation drug with minimal side effects and drug interaction. with the limited information i have i would recommend starting it to prevent future seizures. your neurologist can provide you with its optimal dosing. high white blood cell (wbc) could be related to sinusitis or as a transient rise from seizure itself. it should come down by itself. it would be good to know how long his seizure was and what he did during his seizure. did he passed urine stool or bite his tongue during the episode? revert back with the asked details to a neurologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am writing to get a second opinion for my relative.

exposure to an infectious disease like chicken pox does not mean he is contagious. a person actually needs to have the disease in order to be contagious so depending on when he was exposed there is little or no risk especially if you had the shingles vaccine. chicken pox can be contagious a day before he breaks out in the characteristic pox lesions so there may be a tiny risk but i suspect he also had the chicken pox vaccine himself.	i have ra. my grandson has been exposed to chickenpox. should i stay away from him?

your body prefers not to use amino acids the building blocks of muscle as an energy source unless it has to because it’s simply not the most efficient way for your body to get the energy it needs. your body will typically use the more efficient means of attaining energy first. weight lifting and aerobic exercise can complement each other well but if you have concerns with not being able to gain muscle mass keep the aerobic exercise at a moderate amount. it might be best to refrain from doing overly excessive endurance aerobic events. try doing high intensity interval training. interval training involves coupling short bursts of high intensity exercise with less intense recovery periods. for example you could run on a treadmill for 1 minute at 8mph and then jog for 30 seconds at 6mph repeating for a total of 10 to 15 minutes. this is just an example to illustrate the point; you can do different intensity levels and different work to rest ratios. consider also doing circuit training which is a workout regimen involving resistance training with very little rest in between exercise sets. this form of exercise is high intensity and helps keep your heart rate elevated so that it can function as aerobic exercise while providing a foundation for muscular strength and endurance. lastly make sure that you are getting enough protein in your diet. the essential amino acids necessary for muscular growth and development can only be obtained through dietary intake. if you’re not getting enough protein you won’t be building muscle regardless of your activity. if you're training for an endurance event like a marathon when you might run 60 miles or more per week you'll almost always see a decrease in your muscle mass. for most of us who do more moderate amounts of physical activity there will be minimal if any loss in muscle mass from aerobic exercise -- so there's nothing to worry about. if you do plan on lots of aerobic exercise and are concerned about losing muscle try starting with 20-30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (at 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate) two to three days per week and see how it goes.	does aerobic exercise interfere with muscle gains from weightlifting?

most episodes of diarrhea are mild and of short duration and do not need to be brought to the attention of a doctor. the doctor should be consulted when there is: high fever (temperature greater than 101f). moderate or severe abdominal pain or tenderness. bloody diarrhea that suggests severe intestinal inflammation. diarrhea in persons with serious underlying illness for whom dehydration may have more serious consequences for example persons with diabetes heart disease and aids. severe diarrhea that shows no improvement after 48 hours. moderate or severe dehydration. prolonged vomiting that prevents intake of fluids orally. acute diarrhea in pregnant women because of concern for the health of the fetus. diarrhea that occurs during or immediately after completing a course of antibiotics because the diarrhea may represent antibiotic-associated infection with c. difficile that requires treatment. diarrhea after returning from developing countries or from camping in the mountains because there may be infection with giardia (for which there is treatment). diarrhea that develops in patients with chronic intestinal diseases such as colitis or crohn's disease because the diarrhea may represent worsening of the underlying disease or a complication of the disease both requiring treatment. acute diarrhea in an infant or young child in order to ensure the appropriate use of oral liquids (type amount and rate) to prevent or treat dehydration and to prevent complications of inappropriate use of liquids such as seizures and abnormal blood electrolytes. chronic diarrhea.	when should the doctor be called for diarrhea?

this could really be eczema or psoriasis. the dermatologist can confirm it. simple remedies — like adding oil to bathwater or using a good moisturizer on the skin — can also help. if your baby’s psoriasis become more severe it may need to be treated with light therapy or even oral medication. if itching is a problem the doctor may also prescribe antihistamines and if it looks like there’s a bacterial infection (from scratching the rash for example) she’ll prescribe oral antibiotics. thanks.

first you should know that there is no way that i can tell you for sure who the father of your baby is. but medically you should know that those people are wrong. it is completely possible for you to be impregnated during your period. your period works on a simple cycle: your womb builds up a blood-like lining on the walls of itself that is both cushioning and nutrient-rich; then your ovaries release an egg that waits to be fertilized for a few days or hours depending on the woman (ovulation); then when the egg is not fertilized or the body does not perceive the fertilization the lining falls away and is your period. this last part can happen while you are ovulating or actually after. every woman is different. but most women have 1 week of lining build-up 1 week of ovulation 1 week of waiting then 1 week of period approximately. the only way to know is to have a paternal test done with either a home kit or by a doctor. after the baby is born if your cycle bothers you that much you can have tests done to determine if you ovulate before during or after your period.	i've been told you cannot get pregnant during your period is that 100% true because that would be the only way i am. i got back with my ex on august 7th and started my period the same day. we had sex even with me being on my period and then the period only lasted three days. now i am pregnant and due in april and i'm starting to have doubts because i admit that i was with another man before i got back with my ex and i am currently freaking out that there is a possibility that this baby might not be whose i thought it was this whole time because everyone is telling me you cant get pregnant during your period.

as a man ages his prostate can grow larger. when a man reaches the age of 40 his prostate gland might have increased from the size of a walnut to that of an apricot. by the time he reaches the age of 60 it might be the size of a lemon. because it surrounds part of the urethra the enlarged prostate can squeeze the urethra. this causes problems in the passing of urine. typically these problems passing urine don't occur in men until they are age 50 or older. they can though occur earlier. an enlarged prostate is also called benign (noncancerous) prostatic hyperplasia. it is common and cannot be prevented. age and a family history of bph are risk factors. eight out of every 10 men eventually develop an enlarged prostate. about 90% of men over the age of 85 will have bph. about 30% of men will find their symptoms bothersome.	what is benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) or an enlarged prostate?

"in several of the plans available through healthcare. gov consumers will have to meet a deductible (pay that amount out of pocket) before the insurance plan begins to cover most benefits and services. based on your questions you are also finding some plans that require you to pay a percentage of the costs (so-called ""co-insurance"") for benefits or services after meeting that deductible. so for example you may have to pay 15% of the cost of a physician office visit after the deductible or 25% of a hospital stay."	i am seeing 15%/25%/35% co-insurance after the deductible in network listed on the healthcare. gov plans available. please explain exactly what this means.
"well let's start at the beginning. i'll include some links to more information. the bun (blood urea nitrogen) test basically is used to give an idea of how well your kidneys are working. a ""normal"" bun range for adults is around 6-20 mg/dl. the fact your bun is 21 isn't necessarily reason for concern. many factors (including various medications) can affect the bun result and 21 might even be normal for you. it's hard to say without some past lab results to compare with. serum creatinine ranges in adult men run from about 0. 6-1. 2 mg/dl and for women the range is around 0. 4-1. 0. so it sounds like your creatinine level is within normal limits. a normal bun:creatinine ratio is considered to be 10:1-20:1. your bun/creatinine ratio is slightly elevated but probably no cause for alarm. however your best bet is always to consult a health care provider to discuss these results. what's normal for one person may not be normal for another. that's why we health professionals recommend you get blood work done every year. by comparing past results with current ones we can get a better idea of whether you have a problem developing that needs treatment. since i have no background information on you specifically it's impossible to say if these results deserve further investigation. if you're at all concerned about them you should visit your primary care provider. best wishes to you! no"	a free blood screening = bun of 21; my creatinine serum was 0. 93; and my bun/creatinine ratio was 23. do i call dr.?
not very likely. umbilical hernias -- at least the small ones -- are usually asymptomatic. eight weeks of nausea is not likely related to an umbilical hernia so keep looking for the cause/reason. don't let your doctors throw in the towel.	can umbilical hernia cause nausea? . i've been sick to my stomach for almost 8 weeks. my doctors have done numerous amount of tests. the last test i had done was a ct scan on my abdominal and pelvic area. the only thing that he found was that i have an umbilical hernia but didn't think much of it. is it possible that an umbilical hernia is the reason why i've been feeling nauseous for two weeks?
pre-existing conditions will no longer prevent you from being sold a health plan. insurers are now prohibited from taking a person's health into consideration. you also cannot be charged more for your plan because of the state of your health. given your situation you may qualify for medicaid because many states are expanding the program's eligibility. otherwise you can look to your state's health insurance marketplace for a private insurance policy. you're likely to qualify for financial assistance that will lower the cost of your plan.	how will someone like me receive coverage that actually covers me? . i am unemployed but not poverty-stricken and have two pre-existing conditions. how am i going to be covered for these types of pre-existing conditions?

unfortunately it's impossible to give you an answer in a forum like this because we don't know your complete medical history and because your question can only be answered with a physical examination and possibly some routine blood work to get started. many things can cause fatigue. your tiredness may not even be related to the gastric bypass. only a medical professional can help you get to the bottom of what's causing your fatigue. you can start by making an appointment with your primary health care provider. he or she will perform routine tests and then refer you to a specialist if necessary. wishing you well!	why am i always tired now that i am one year post op gastric bypass
untreated athlete's foot can potentially spread to other body parts or other people including family members. fungus may spread locally to the legs toenails hands fingernails and essentially any body area. this type of fungus generally likes to live in the skin hair and nails. it does not invade deep go into body organs or go into the blood system. fungal infections of the nails are called tinea unguium or onychomycosis. nail fungus may be very difficult to treat. antifungal pills may be required in cases of more advanced toenail fungal infections. fungal nail infection (onychomycosis) groin fungus (tinea cruris) body skin fungus (tinea corporis) secondary bacterial infections people with diabetes hiv/aids cancer or other immune problems may be more prone to all kinds of infections including fungus. when the skin is injured by fungus the natural protective skin barrier is broken. bacteria and yeasts can then invade the broken skin. bacteria can cause a bad smell. bacterial infection of the skin and resulting inflammation is known as cellulitis. this is especially likely to occur those individuals with diabetes chronic leg swelling who have had veins removed (such as for heart bypass surgery) or in the elderly. bacterial skin infections also occur more frequently in patients with impaired immune systems.	what are possible complications of athlete's foot?
i suspect you have seen those television ads that promise compensation for male gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) due to an association with respirdal. i see this common problem in pubescent many times per month and none of them are taking respirdal. granted i only have a few patients on this drug and none of the boys have breast tissue. if there is a link as the lawyer group claims i sure have not seen it. i would seriously doubt that your son would have this problem surface seven years after taking this drug for only thirty days. he should see his medical provider nonetheless to be properly examined.	respridal. my son took respridal in 2007 for less than 30 days. he has an enhanced chest area. should his chest area gone back down after stopping the meds or is it a prolonged side effect of the medication? thank you.
if you are concerned that you have anemia the only way that you can determine this is to have a blood test for hemoglobin. you will need to have your doctor order this test unless you can find a lab to order one on yourself. if you are anemic your treatment options would depend on the extent of the anemia and type of anemia. not all cases of anemia are related to blood loss or iron-deficiency in the diet. some can be self-treated by nutritional changes while others cannot. as a vegetarian it is your responsibility to make sure you are getting sufficient nutrients including protein and iron-containing foods(occasionally deficient in some vegetarian diets).	i'm vegetarian. i get a lot of headaches and i am tired all the time especially when menstruating. is this anaemia? . should i see a doctor or can i treat myself?

"i'm sorry you're going through this and that it's concerning you. the skin is an amazing organ. one thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skin's surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm. this engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing (a red appearance) and may make the skin feel hot. the body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core. i guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday? is it because you're exercising for example? are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes? or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day? our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if you're getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit. i mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally (your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat) but perhaps there's some underlying cause for this that should be checked out. i wish you all the best with this! i have a question for you. do you have a hard time sweating or perspiring? the purpose of sweating is to keep our bodies from overheating. over the years i have found that since i have a problem sweating my body has no way of releasing the heat and therefore anyone that comes to hug and kiss my cheek always ask me why i feel sooooo hot or like i have a fever when i don't. the heat is trapped inside. not being able to sweat is known as ""anhidrosis"" research it and ask your doctor if this could be your issue. i have also found that i have an issue with dehydration and when i drink the amount of water needed for my body weight then it helps reduce my inner heat as well as benefits me in other healthy ways. hope this helps. this is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by chinese medicine call ""empty heat"" or ""empty fire"" ""the clinical manifestations of empty heat in general (irrespective of organ) are: - a feeling of heat in the afternoon/evening - a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips - malar flush (red cheekbones) - a dry throat at night - a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles (also called a5-palm heat@) - dry stools - scanty-dark urine - a floating-empty and rapid pulse - a red tongue without coating. "" <link> applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body. see the url above for more information. western medicine does not yet understand this pattern of symptoms. i would recommend seeing a competent traditional chinese medical doctor in your area preferably one with the degree omd (orental medical doctor) a traditional chinese medical doctor not just a licensed acupuncturist. (the difference can be more that 5 years of study and clinical education) hello i have googled this specific question with the intention of answering all the queries that exist on the web with regards to this question because i myself had been suffering this for the last 4 months and it made me feel really sick uneasy and tired and i hated the feeling of having to always keep myself in cool places and have to have three baths a day to just feel normal. i finally found the cure in an unlikely place. i have always had a little feeling of sickness when in warm places since a young age but it got really bad 4 months back and every normal doctor i went to did all medical checks but all parameters such as blood pressure temperature and blood test etc were normal but i still was feeling heat since i am in india somebody suggested i visit an ayurvedic doctor(ayurvedic doctors are doctors who prescribe medicines and treatments according to an ancient indian text called the ayurveda <link> so i made the trip to a well known ayurvedic doctor at the rejuvenation center at an ashram called isha in coimbatore tamil nadu india and the doctor there just felt my wrist and started her diagnosis and without me even telling her the symptoms she said everything is normal but there is a lot of heat trapped in your system and she said it is not a very rare problem she said that no mainstream medicine doctor has been able to diagnose it till date cause there is no such thing as body heat in allopathic(mainstream) medicine there is only temperature she said in ayurveda it's called ushna(heat) and she said no need to go into the cause of it just have these ayurvedic medicines and i have been having them for three days now and i can feel the heat slowly leaving my system i am suppose to take the medicines for 40 days but just today being the third day i am already feelin 60% better and ease has returned to the whole body and she also gave me some medicines to repair the minor damage to the system from this heat so i would like to suggest to anybody who is having this problem that if no doctor is able to help then please no matter what country you are in please look for a good ayurvedic or siddha(<link> doctor nowadays they are all over the world and if there isn't one in your country then do make the trip to india and i highly recommend the one i went to even if it is expensive to make the trip it is better to spend that then live with the problem for the rest of your life or contact them at <link> they might be able to ship the medicines if you are in a different country. hope you'll all get okay soon cause i have been through the frustrating experience of going to many mainstream doctors and not finding a solution till this happened and i feel like a real fool for doubting that any alternative medicine science could actually have something very simple but powerful in it. hello friends i had similar problem since almost 10 years. i am m/30 years now. my normal body temperature when i was not feeling feverish would be about 96. 8 f (almost 2 degree fahrenheit lesser than normal). when i am feeling feverish the temperature would rise to about 97. ish rarely reaching 98. no doctor would agree that i have fever since it doesn't show up on thermometer. however strangely my skin is very hot to touch and even normal person could feel that but interior body temperature is not. i would feel feverish with chills. i would have episodes of feverish feeling every 2 months or so and every time it would last for a 2-3 weeks. doctor would prescribe some antibiotics and do some tests but they were not helpful. i do not have thyroid or any other deficiency however i have been recently diagnosed with celiac disease as well. the reason i write this time is because something miraculous happened this and i would want others' opinion if it helps relieve your symptoms as well. this might very well be a cure: treatment: day1: take 500mg paracetamol. after 30 mins take vitamin c + zinc supplement day2: continue vitamin c+ zinc daily for next few days. i got fantastic relief on day 2 onwards and no longer feel hot and my temperature is back to 96. 9ish j waiting for your inputs and wishing a speedy recovery."	i have no fever but my skin feels hot. what does that mean? . this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot. my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards. it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back.

we are here to help you. from the way you are describing it seems either you had an arrhythmia that time or you had angina pain. since your blood pressure and heart rate are in normal ranges without medicines you should avoid any medicines at this time. i would recommend for you a treadmill test that is a stress test to rule out any angina on exertion. if that comes out to be normal then you would need to go for holter monitoring. take antacid drug like omeprazole for this purpose as this would help you in fighting with acidity as a cause of chest pain. however acidity is very unlikely to be a cause for that. i hope it helps you. revert back after the tests to a cardiologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am 37 years old and normally take Hydrochlorothiazide for diastolic blood pressure and Zebeta for S node dysfunction. I am also on Metformin. My A1c is 6.1. Two days ago, I started experiencing dull cramping chest pain that was not continuous. I went to the ER and all the tests came back fine (chest x-ray, EKG and blood work). He did not know what was the cause for my pain. They gave me Nitro pill and Nitro paste on my chest which decreased the amount of pain. Up on  release, my blood pressure was 101/55 mmHg and pulse 61.  I had not taken my pills on the day this occurred or the last two days. It has been running around 104/63 mmHg and pulse 69. My diastolic BP without medicine usually runs around 95. And my resting heart rate was 140 before I started medicine, so this is a huge change for me. These are not new medicines either. I have attached all my test reports for your reference.
i don’t think that there is quite enough research yet to justify the claim that red peppers can treat hypertension. the simple answer is that there never is one “super food” that should be emphasized more than any other to treat any health condition. i would suggest looking into the dash diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). the dash diet emphasizes fruits vegetables fat-free or low-fat dairy products whole grain products fish poultry and nuts. it’s also lower in red meat sugars and sodium. this diet has been shown to lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people. a healthy eating plan such as the dash diet along with a consistent cardiovascular exercise routine can be part of an effective treatment and management plan for hypertension. consult with your doctor further and please visit the following website for more information: <link> hi yes your right google cayennepepper do it as one word it will take you to a site all about cayenne pepper look down the left hand side its all there. good luck	is red pepper a good supplement to treat hypertension. i have read that a ingrediant in red pepper is very good at treating hypertension
you have mentioned numbness in the inner part of the left foot as your main symptom. most commonly numbness is a manifestation of a nerve involvement it can be compression of the nerve at an anatomical site like in back or anywhere along the course of the nerve or it may be a manifestation of a systemic disease like diabetes or any condition that leads to what we call as neuropathy. now your trigger has been the yoga courses which you do on a regular basis every year but you have done may be for a prolonged period this year. being an orthopaedic surgeon i may not be able to guide you anything regarding yoga and its usefulness but it is logical to stop all these postures till your condition settles and improves. my guess is that there has been some prolonged compression during your classes or there could be an entrapment somewhere along the course of your nerve. i need to know from you: whether you have any back pain? is there any radiating pain from the spine region all along the course of your limb? apart from numbness are there any other symptoms of neurological involvement like weakness paresthesias burning sensations etc. also present? if the answers to above questions are no my suggestion to you will be to wait for a few days and start with medications for neuropathic symptoms like pregabalin or gabapentin along with vitamin b 12 supplementation and it is a good possibility that your symptoms may subside over next 4-6 weeks because there might be nerve neuropraxia (mid nerve injury). in case your symptoms do not improve or if they increase then i suggest you to get few blood tests done and nerve conduction studies to look for any compressive pathology. get back to an orthopaedician and traumatologist online for further queries --> <link>	Hello Doctor,I am a 39 year old male. My height is 6 feet and I weigh 81 kg. Right side of my left foot is having numbness though it is not 100% numb. The left side of the foot has little pain. I get a feeling that there is some blockage in the blood flow though it might not be the case.I am a regular vipassana meditator and I have been going to 10 day courses regularly for the past 6 years. This time I decided to do a 30 day course. This numbness started happening on the 10th day and continued for 20 more days. A typical vipassana requires sitting for 13-14 hours with small breaks at regular intervals. I thought I will get better once I start doing activity after coming back home (though I used to walk for 15-20 minutes daily during the course also). I never had such problem in the past courses. There was no improvement in the condition even after 15 days after coming back. I have done alternate hot and cold water treatment but did not see any improvement. I also tried doing massage using rheumatic oil.  In case it helps, my family has had cases of diabetics (my grandmother and my father's brothers). What would you recommend?

in the united states the flu season usually occurs from about november until april. officials have decided each new flu season will start on oct. 4. typically activity is very low until december and peak activity most often occurs between january and march. ideally the conventional flu vaccine should be administered between september and mid-november. it takes about one to two weeks after vaccination for antibodies against influenza to develop and provide protection. the cdc has published a summary list of their current recommendations of who should get the 2010-2011 vaccine: summary of influenza vaccination recommendations 2010 all people 6 months and older should be vaccinated annually. protection of people at higher risk for influenza-related complications should continue to be a focus of vaccination efforts as providers and programs transition to routine vaccination of all people 6 months and older. when vaccine supply is limited vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to people who are 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of age are 50 years of age and older have chronic pulmonary (including asthma) cardiovascular (except hypertension) renal hepatic neurologic hematologic or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus) are or will be pregnant during the influenza season are 6 months to 18 years of age and receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who therefore might be at risk for experiencing reye's syndrome after influenza virus infection are residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities are american indians/alaska natives are morbidly obese (body mass index is 40 or greater) are health-care personnel are household contacts and caregivers of children aged younger than 5 years and adults aged 50 years and older with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged younger than 6 months; and are household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza as each flu season progresses and as the cdc refines its data from previous flu seasons and pandemics this summary may be modified. the cdc publishes routine updates about the flu at flu. gov and at <link>.	who should receive the flu vaccine? when should someone get the flu shot?

(examples: arthritis foundation the national multiple sclerosis society). also ask your physician and contact your local hospital to see if there are any medically monitored programs in your community. many of these are covered by insurance and provide enrollees with both exercise and education about their condition. numerous people routinely enroll in cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation programs around the country and are astounded with the benefits they get out of these programs. finally since your on webmd check out our article base by doing a search on exercise as there are numerous articles on exercising with a chronic disease."	what should i do if i am physically unable to exercise due to a medical condition?

surgery to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for penile cancer. a doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following operations: wide local excision takes out only the cancer and some normal tissue on either side. electrodessication and curettage removes the cancer by scraping the tumor with a curette (thin long instrument with a scraping edge) and applying an electric current to the area to kill cancer cells. cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the cancer cells. microsurgery (moh's surgery) is an operation that removes the cancer and as little normal tissue as possible. during this surgery the doctor uses a microscope to look at the cancerous area to make sure all the cancer cells are removed. laser surgery uses a narrow beam of light to remove cancer cells. circumcision is an operation that removes the foreskin. amputation of the penis (penectomy) is an operation that removes the penis. it is the most common and most effective treatment of cancer of the penis. in a partial penectomy part of the penis is removed. in a total penectomy the whole penis is removed. lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery. radiation which uses high-energy rays to attack cancer and chemotherapy which uses drugs to kill cancer are other treatment options.	what treatments are given for penile cancer?
hi some bits of info that may help you. autoimmune disease: autoimmune endocrine disease such as hypothyroidism addison's disease and diabetes may be associated with premature ovarian failure. an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones. common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness weight gain and feeling depressed. an underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. there's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it. this is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood. high cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries restricting the flow of blood. if your offered statins for high cholesterol just say no thank you they have many bad side effects have a read on this one site www. spacedoc. com its packed with info by a whole load of doctors. hope this helps you. good luck	can hypothyroidism cause premature menopause? . i have hypothyroidism and i am almost 40. my doctor thinks i might be going through the early stages of premature menopause. i have read that hypothyroidism can cause it. is this true?

there are a couple different versions of excedrin available but it typically contains acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine. ibuprofen is a pain reliever that is very similar to aspirin. taking both ibuprofen and excedrin together will probably not be beneficial and may cause harm. taken together these medications will likely cause stomach upset and may lead to a stomach ulcer. i would not recommend this particular combination. if one product or the other is not sufficient for your pain talk with your local pharmacist or health care provider who could suggest other options depending on the type of pain that you are experiencing.	can you mix ibuprofen and excedrin for pain relief?
"hepatitis means ""inflamed liver. "" as you probably know there are many different things that can cause the liver to become inflamed. we use the letters a b c and so on to denote several known bacterial and virus infections that cause hepatitis. hepatitis c is caused by a virus and cannot be cured. therefore it's important to know how you can get hep-c. you get hepatitis c through direct contact with infected blood. the typical ways this happens is: sharing needles used to inject illicit drugs getting a tattoo with a needle contaminated with hep-c getting a piercing using equipment contaminated with hep-c having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant prior to 1992 receiving an injection with a needle that was previously used to inject someone with hep-c you get the idea. hepatitis c is of particular concern to baby boomers because they may have become infected back in the summer of love (late 1960s) and not even know it. that's why the centers for disease control recommend all people born between 1946 and 1964 get tested for hep-c. hepatitis c can live in your body for years without causing symptoms. if you think you may have been exposed to hepatitis c you should see a health care provider. a simple blood test can tell you if you have the virus or not. wishing you well!"	hepititis c how do you get it?

gonorrhea is a sexually-transmitted disease so if you truly have an accurate diagnosis of gonorrhea involving your penis you did not get it from kissing a girl twice unless this kiss involved your genitals and she had pharyngeal gonorrhea. non-sexually transmitted gonorrhea is technically possible if you had penile contact with fresh secretions like a toilet seat or wearing someone's contaminated underwear but as you can imagine this rarely if ever happens. so if you are being 100% honest and i assume that you are then i would have no idea how you got it. if you had a throat culture that grew out neisseria (the genus of gonorrhea) then it will need more thorough laboratory testing since there can be an innocent gram-negative bacterial species of neisseria that grows in the throat that is not gonorrhea.	i am a gonorrhea patient. but i never had sex. i just kissed a girl twice. so what is the reason? i m so depressed. pls hp
the medication has fda approval however if the fda didn't approve it for the exact reason you're using it your plan may deny coverage. there could be other reasons they won't cover it. maybe you need prior authorization or there are limits to the amount you can buy or the particular brand your doctor prescribes isn't covered. insurance policies impose a wide range of rules we must follow to have our care or prescription drugs covered. i would go further with your health plan and push to speak with someone who can give you a clear understanding of why you suddenly can't get the patches so you have a better idea of how to proceed.	is lidocaine patch approved by fda for sugical nerve trauma. surgical trauma of nerve tissue treated by lidocaine patch approved by fda? i have been using them for at least 3 years and they work for me. however now medicare part d is saying they are not fda approved for this condition. i have other articles saying differently. please explain.

"the answer is probably yes. usually individuals at risk for developing liver cancer are those with cirrhosis (advanced liver disease with permanent liver scarring). in other words cirrhosis is a precancerous condition. in fact patients with cirrhosis regardless of the underlying cause are at increased risk of developing liver cancer for example patients with cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis c chronic hepatitis b hemochromatosis alcohol and fatty liver. some of these groups of patients should have periodic ultrasound examinations of the liver as well as blood tests for alpha fetoprotein (a blood test that is produced by liver cancers) to detect the development of liver cancer early. there is one group of patients without cirrhosis that is at risk of developing liver cancer; that group of patients has chronic infection with the hepatitis b virus. a typical patient would be somebody born with hepatitis b infection contracted from his/her mother at birth (common in asia). the baby's immature immune system does not recognize the hepatitis b virus as ""foreign"" and thus tolerates the virus. (the body's immune system does not wage war against the virus. ) the hepatitis b virus is able to multiply and flourish in the body without causing the hepatitis (liver inflammation caused by the immune system) that leads to cirrhosis. however the virus can damage the dna in the liver cells and cause liver cancer. these patients typically have high levels of hepatitis b virus in their blood but normal liver enzymes and normal liver biopsies. such patients should have ultrasound examinations of the liver and alpha fetoprotein blood tests every six months to look for developing liver cancers."	are people who carry the hepatitis b virus but who do not have liver disease or hepatitis at risk for liver cancer?

even in people with chronic hepatitis b the immune system is working to suppress the virus. medications that suppress the immune system allow the virus to reproduce in large numbers and may cause the hepatitis to flare. examples of medications that suppress the immune system are: prednisone: used to treat many diseases including asthma inflammatory bowel disease and certain types of skin disease and arthritis. methotrexate (rheumatrex trexall): used to treat certain types of skin disease arthritis and cancer. cyclophosphamide (cytoxan): used to treat some cancers. if an immunosuppressant drug is stopped the body's immune system's activity may rebound and cause severe inflammation of the liver.	what are the effects of immunosuppressive medications on hepatitis b virus?

the risk of too much folic acid is low. but as with any vitamin it is possible to consume too much folic acid if you combine supplements with food. adults should not get more than 1000 micrograms of folic acid per day. to put it into perspective a folic acid supplement or multivitamin usually has about 400 micrograms. other than breakfast cereals that are fortified with 100% of your folic acid needs (400 micrograms per day) most foods have relatively little folic acid content. for example we often recommend leafy green vegetables as a good source of folic acid. but frozen spinach which has the most folic acid has only 115 micrograms in a 1/2 cup. my point is that even if you take a folic acid supplement you still have plenty of room to enjoy foods rich in folic acid without the risk of over-consumption.	can a person consume too much folic acid?

no sepsis itself is not contagious. sepsis is an out-of-control infection due to bacteria viruses or other invading organisms. when an infection becomes uncontrolled localized symptoms (like diarrhea from e. coli food poisoning or coughing and sneezing from influenza) become serious whole-body symptoms like a rapid heart rate low blood pressure and confusion. although a person’s infection itself may be contagious (you’d have to know the specific organism to say) sepsis is a complicated response to infection that varies widely between individuals and is poorly understood in general. however it’s clear that most people with sepsis don’t transmit their infection to anyone else and most people with infections (from any cause) don’t get sepsis.	is sepsis contagious?

"as a diabetic you are considered to be immunocompromised -- more prone to infections and more prone to infections becoming serious. pseumomonas is among the most common organisms that cause otitis externa so this is not uncommon. having painful ""cold sores"" (herpes) in the ear is more rare but does happen. think of it as having shingles in the ear. the disease is called ramsay-hunt syndrome assuming you were properly diagnosed. the treatment of a bacterial infection is with antibiotics but a viral infection like herpes requires antiviral medications. if you have not seen an ear specialist or dermatologist this may be something to consider since having a definitive diagnosis is essential if you are to be properly treated."	how does a person get cold sores in their ear? how serious is this? can i use over the counter creams? . i am diabetic. 42 yrs old. smoker. dont drink or do drugs. had a bacterial ear infection from nov 2013 to march 2014. pseudomonosa argeonosa (sp? ). gp thought possibly coldsores in my ear too. finally only scab was left in my ear but it never went away. the scab was thick and white. 2 weeks ago i started getting blisters in my ear again but the fluid is clear somerimes a bit yellow but not green like when i had the bacterial infection. any help or info would be appreciated. thank you.
brain tumors can be benign or malignant : benign brain tumors do not contain cancer cells. usually benign tumors can be removed and they seldom grow back. the border or edge of a benign brain tumor can be clearly seen. cells from benign tumors do not invade tissues around them or spread to other parts of the body. however benign tumors can press on sensitive areas of the brain and cause serious health problems. unlike benign tumors in most other parts of the body benign brain tumors are sometimes life threatening. very rarely a benign brain tumor may become malignant. malignant brain tumors contain cancer cells. malignant brain tumors are generally more serious and often are life threatening. they are likely to grow rapidly and crowd or invade the surrounding healthy brain tissue. very rarely cancer cells may break away from a malignant brain tumor and spread to other parts of the brain to the spinal cord or even to other parts of the body. the spread of cancer is called metastasis. sometimes a malignant tumor does not extend into healthy tissue. the tumor may be contained within a layer of tissue. or the bones of the skull or another structure in the head may confine it. this kind of tumor is called encapsulated. tumor grade doctors sometimes group brain tumors by grade - from low grade (grade i) to high grade (grade iv). the grade of a tumor refers to the way the cells look under a microscope. cells from high-grade tumors look more abnormal and generally grow faster than cells from low-grade tumors.	what are benign and malignant brain tumors?

doctors define constipation as having a bowel movement less than three times per week. that doesn’t mean constipation is necessarily dangerous just that it’s then labeled abnormal possibly needing treatment. for people who are generally healthy constipation is almost never a serious health risk. so it’s difficult to answer the question of “how long can you go ” because if you’re generally healthy you eventually will go with few if any adverse effects. people for whom constipation can have serious health effects include: • the elderly especially those with dementia; • people with damage to the nerves controlling defecation such as hirschsprung disease or spinal cord injuries. a general rule is if you’re healthy and you’re not experiencing abdominal pain a small delay between bowel movements should be of no concern. from a medical standpoint stimulating bowel movements for their own sake (such as with “colon cleansing” or excessive laxative use) can have risks. constipation can result from hard stools and/or slow movement of the colon. for most healthy people with constipation simple treatments work: • increased fiber intake • bulk-forming laxatives (citrucel fiberall metamucil serutan) • stimulant laxatives (alophen dulcolax ex-lax and senokot) • stool softeners (colace correctol soft gels diocto surfak) a few people will need prescription medicines to help get their bowels moving. if constipation isn’t causing symptoms though waiting for nature to take its course is the best option. 4 to 5 days	how long can you go without a bowel movement? . doctors define constipation as having a bowel movement less than three times per week. that doesn’t mean constipation is necessarily dangerous just that it’s then labeled abnormal possibly needing treatment.

"i'm happy to help you understand this. bun/creatinine is a combination of laboratory tests that measure your kidney function. bun stands for ""blood urea nitrogen. "" the test looks basically looks at your kidneys' ability to filter the naturally occurring waste product urea from your blood. if you have a high level of urea in your blood then your kidneys may not be working well. the creatinine lab test measures how much creatinine (another naturally occurring waste product) is in your blood. the kidneys should filter creatinine very efficiently so a high creatinine level could mean your kidneys aren't functioning well. the lab result you are asking about bun/creatinine ratio basically tells whether or not your are dehydrated. when a person is severely dehydrated his or her bun level will rise more than the creatinine level. in your case your bun/creatinine ratio is 24. that is barely above the high end of the reference range (normal range). this means you could be mildly dehydrated but basically you seem to be fine. wishing you well!"	can you tell me what this result means? bun/creatinine ratio 24 reference range: 9-23

i can't answer that question since i don't know your symptoms have the ability to examine you or see those test results. i can tell you that about half of the women (i am also assuming you are a female) who have symptoms of a uti do not have them. many will have urethral irritation (usually from sexual activity) or even a vaginal infection. the culture is much more accurate than the rapid urine test so follow your instructions and see your medical provider again if you are not getting better.	the doctors did a rapid test to see if i had an uti and it came back positivebut the culture came back negitive. i went to the doctors on friday night and they did a rapid test to see if i had an uti and it came back positive. today i got a call saying the urinalysis came back negative and that i should follow up with my doctor and to continue to take the antibiotics they prescribed to me. what else could i have if the culture came back negative? what does that mean?
most helpful answer it takes significant trauma to the uterus to do any harm to a baby or the uterus itself. the baby is very well protected by the muscular wall of the uterus itself amniotic fluid and the abdominal wall of the mom. typically if there is no vaginal bleeding or significant pain the baby is okay. if she has started feeling the baby move she can also make sure the baby has continued to move. nonetheless it is always best to let her doctor know immediately anytime there has been trauma to the abdomen.	daughter is 20 weeks pregnant and was accidently hit in stomach near hip. is baby and uterus ok? . it only hurt for a minute or two. she said it doesn't hurt now. i just want to be sure baby and uterus are ok.

the symptoms of heart failure are related to the changes that occur to your heart and body and may be moderate to severe depending on how weak your heart is. the symptoms can include: congested lungs. fluid back up in the lungs can cause shortness of breath with exercise or difficulty breathing at rest which is often worse when lying flat in bed. lung congestion can also cause a dry hacking cough or wheezing. fluid and water retention. less blood to your kidneys causes fluid and water retention resulting in swollen ankles legs and abdomen (called edema) and weight gain. symptoms may cause an increased need to urinate during the night. bloating in your stomach may cause a loss of appetite or nausea. dizziness fatigue and weakness. less blood to your major organs and muscles makes you feel tired and weak. less blood to the brain can cause dizziness or confusion. rapid or irregular heartbeats. the heart beats faster to pump enough blood to the body. this can cause a fast or irregular heartbeat. if you have heart failure you may have one or all of these symptoms or you may have none of them. in addition your symptoms may not be related to how weak your heart is; you may have many symptoms but your heart function may be only mildly weakened. or you may have a more severely damaged heart but have no symptoms.	what are the symptoms of heart failure?

shortness of breath is an early symptom seen in congestive heart failure patients. swollen ankles and feet is a more serious symptom and may be evidenced by swollen extremities (especially the ankles) and by weight gain. i have known some congestive heart failure victims to gain as much as fifteen pounds in one day. one individual in particular stands out in my mind. she was much younger than 85 years old and took lasix (diuretic) every day to release excess fluid. when swollen extremities and weight gain of at least seven pounds occurred metolazone (known as the turbo pill) was added to the daily regimen for a very short period of time until the acute water build up was under control. although gaining six pounds of weight in two weeks is not in itself a medical crisis it is a sign of fluid retention and justifies being assessed in person by a physician. being 85 years old with overt congestive heart failure symptoms puts this person in a potentially life threatening situation. despite the upsetting emotions that a trip to the e. r. may evoke in this person it is better to be safe than sorry. i suggest that you phone her physician first and then take this person to the hospital for treatment. best wishes for this lady's speedy recovery.	swollen feet and shortness of breath are new symptoms of a 85 yr old who has congestive heart failure. however her oxygen levels are 100%. she has gained 6 pds over the last two weeks and has difficulty eating. we were advised by her physician to observe her (she has a pending appt nxt wk) and she has been taken her medication regularly and has strictly followed her diet. . should this warrant a visit to the e/r? i am trying to avoid additional stress on her since she has alzheimer's and dementia and the goings to the hospital get her confused and she comes back home more fragile than ever.

here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. no. 1: control your weight if you are at a healthy weight maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. if you are overweight losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. data from the first national health and nutrition examination survey a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of americans showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. the risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. being overweight strains the joints particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees hips and joints of the feet causing the cartilage to wear away. if you already have osteoarthritis losing weight may help improve symptoms. no. 2: exercise if the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. fortunately even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles the quadriceps can reduce the risk. if fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers which may make it easier for you to exercise and stay active. the safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints such as bicycling swimming and water exercise. light weight lifting exercises are another option but if you already have osteoarthritis first speak with your doctor. no. 3: avoid injuries or get them treated suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. people who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. to avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases recommends the following: avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. when jumping land with your knees bent. do warm-up exercises before sports even less vigorous ones such as golf. cool down after vigorous sports. wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. if you have a joint injury it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. no. 4: eat right although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. they include: omega-3 fatty acids. these healthy fats reduce joint inflammation while unhealthy fats can increase it. good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils including walnut canola soybean flaxseed/linseed and olive. vitamin c. one study of participants in the framingham study found that moderate intake of vitamin c (120-200 milligrams per day) reduced the risk of osteoarthritis progression threefold. you can get more vitamin c in your diet by eating green peppers citrus fruits and juices strawberries tomatoes broccoli turnip greens and other leafy greens sweet and white potatoes and cantaloupe. vitamin d. another study of framingham study participants showed that people who have knee osteoarthritis and low blood levels of vitamin d are three times more likely to experience disease progression compared to people with high levels of the vitamin. your body makes most of the vitamin d it needs in response to sunlight. you can get more vitamin d in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon mackerel tuna sardines and herring; vitamin d-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs.	what can i do to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression?

"" your doctor may give you a checklist of some foods that frequently cause problems including ""gassy"" foods such as broccoli cauliflower beans and whole grains. some dietitians recommend eating five or six small meals rather than two or three large ones. drinking plenty of fluids especially water can also help. but remember: no two ulcerative colitis sufferers are alike. a food that bothers one person may cause no problems at all in someone else. although a variety of popular inflammatory bowel disease diets have received a lot of hype doctors say no one diet has been proven to effectively treat the disease."	should i change my diet because of ulcerative colitis?

see your medical provider or gynecologist. there is a more sensitive blood pregnancy test that you can have. and yes because there may be other causes for your array of symptoms including your late or missed period you should be carefully examined and those other causes should be investigated.	my period is a week late but the pregnancy tests are negative. could i be pregnant? . i've never missed a period in my life. they've been late before by 2 maybe 3 days but never a week late. i've taken 2 tests and they both came back negative. i've had a few symptoms like being hungry all the time/random food cravings dizziness always feeling exhausted cramps but no bleeding sensitive sense of smell and as of today certain smells make my stomach turn. if i'm not pregnant could there be something else wrong with me since the tests came back negative?
i certainly understand her reluctance to seek medical attention when she doesn't have insurance. many communities offer free or low-cost clinics to people who are uninsured. maybe you can help her find one of these. i think your daughter needs to get this checked out. it may be completely benign such as a lipoma (a fatty non-cancerous tumor). but then again it could be something more serious. certainly if your daughter has a fever or is experiencing unintended weight loss she needs to be checked out as soon as possible. you might encourage your daughter also by reminding her the cost of an office visit is substantially less than the cost of an emergency room visit so why put off getting this thing looked at? i wish your daughter all the best!	my daughter has a lump on the right side of her neck. it feels hard and is tender. if you make a circle with your thumb and pointing finger it is about that size. it is literally on the side of her neck not where i would think glands are. it is noticable without touching it. without insurance she is reluctant to go to the doctor but i'm concerned.

individuals afflicted with social anxiety tend to worry about being judged by others (especially peers). there may be feelings of being rejected coupled with a lack of self-esteem. as a young child this trait is probably rooted in our genetics and protective in nature. it is part of the normal growth and development process. children in this stage may be referred to as being shy. most young children and adolescents outgrow this condition as they enter into adulthood. where you go to meet friends is wide open. depending on your age some places to meet friends may include: school clubs sporting activities the work place and church to name a few. volunteering to help others is a great way to meet new people while contributing to the community. think about joining a speech club. many members of these clubs start out feeling nervous about engaging in public speaking activities and possibly to speaking in smaller social settings. these club members are usually very supportive and enjoy helping newer participants overcome their speaking fears by developing overall self-confidence. take a personal inventory to determine outside- of -the- house activities that you enjoy and look for an opportunity to participate. many local newspapers dedicate column space to advertising upcoming neighborhood events and meetings. yes some individuals with social anxiety tendencies may best respond to talk therapy and/or medication. but overcoming social anxiety disorder is a process that involves having a small number of interpersonal interactions triumphs and building on their success. practice looking people in the eye and greeting them warmly. say good morning to neighbors colleagues at school and work and even to people at the grocery store while waiting in line. the risks are worth the rewards. these positive experiences tend to promote a sense of confidence. from that added confidence we tend to develop more competence in our social exchanges. the pay-off of your risk taking is that a nice positive circle of social interactions should occur. your self-image and self-esteem will improve resulting in a more enriched life.	social anxiety. i want friends where do i go? i have such bad social anxiety when i first get to know someone but then it lessens
taking multivitamins during pregnancy is extremely important for proper fetus growth and development. the rda has recommended values of how much of each vitamin and mineral is recommended during pregnancy. there are many brands available on the market as prescription strength and over-the-counter. some are more tailored toward specific women lacking different components than others. a more expensive vitamin is not necessarily better than others. work with your ob-gyn to help select a vitamin that will work best for you. size and cost can play a role in the selection process more importantly to aid in compliance. avoid taking several different supplements. take one multivitamin that includes a variety of necessary nutrients in one dose. combining supplements (such as taking a folic acid supplement along with your multivitamin etc. ) can raise concerns because you run the risk of overdosing on a particular nutrient. taking more than twice the rda of any nutrient should be avoided during pregnancy.	what are the best vitamins for a pregnant woman?

your doctor started medicine on the basis of your delayed periods and considering it as pcos (polycystic ovarian syndrome). that is why glycomet (metformin) and oosure. you must get yourself investigated and confirm the reason for delay. as for now since 13 days are over you should have done a urine for pregnancy test. if not done then get a scan done which will tell you the reason for delay whether pregnancy or it will show if polycystic ovaries. moreover since it will be on day 2 of cycle and it will guide your gynecologist about the number of follicles in the ovary. if the scan is fine then i will advise you to get yourself investigated for conceiving including your husband's semen examination. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hello doctor,I am a 29 year old female. I am trying to conceive for the past one year. Four months back, my period was delayed for 12 days, and so I got a consultation.

well the thing is you don't want to put ice on it. if you put ice on it believe it or not the burn is kind of open skin in some cases so ice will actually adhere to the skin. so when you try to take the ice off of it you will rip layers of skin with it and possibly cause an infection. the recommendation is really to use tepid or cool water; not super cold but right in the middle and submerse the area. butter and mayonnaise to me are like wives' tales. people believe that they should be putting some type of ointment on it to help replace the moisture in the skin. that is not the case. we found out in a lot of cases now that you need to let the air get to it and let it heal by itself because when they were putting things like ointments and creams on it it was trapping in bacteria leading to skin infections. if you notice though it's blistering and the area is extremely red. you probably need to go and have it looked at by a healthcare provider because there are some prescription ointments and creams that are specifically used for burns.	is it okay to put ice on a burn; what about butter or mayonnaise?

medicines all do very different things and all have their own side effects. i would hope your doctor is not sending you the message that they are arbitrarily interchangeable. he or she should be telling you the pros and cons of each (what specific benefits if any can be expected from each) as they pertain to your specific symptoms and problems. it's not the patient's job to tell the surgeon what kind of sutures the surgeon should use.	i am afraid of medication side effects so my doctor gave me a list of drugs to look up and choose from. is this ok?

"you can locate your doctor through the state medical board that licenses her. many times this information is available on line. if this doctor still works in the same state you will be able to locate her. if she has moved out of state it may be a moot point unless a patient is willing to move to this new area. the internet is also a great way to find anyone if you know how to do this type of search. because of continuity of care issues the medical facility is really required to give you copies of all medical records but that may not be required to give the new address. you can try mailing a letter that has ""personal and confidential"" on the envelope to see if it gets forwarded to her."	my doctor left the facility she used to be at and they claim they don't know where she went? . i need to find out where she went to but i called the hospitals she's affiliated with as well as her previous facility and they all say they don't have her new information. my mom has alot of medical issues (heart surgery in 2010 and hypertension etc) and this doctor was her pcp. she doesn't want to change doctors all of a sudden and i feel like it's wrong that i am not able to find her. what can i do?

you have had bloody stools for five years? and tears? and a nickle-sized growth for three years? you are either very tolerant of these symptom or very reluctant to see a medical provider about them. either way my advice is for you to be properly examined. the nature of these things cannot be blindly determined by a vague description. one possibility comes to mind (there are many) and that would be pilonidal sinus tracts. these occur in the gluteal fold (butt crack) and can last a long long time. they become infected quite often resuting in drainage and pain. the cause of your bloody stools can be related to this or it could be an entirely different problem. and any of these problems could be serious. you must see a medical provider or better yet a proctologist.	what could cause bloody stools tares in the butt crack and a nickle sized growth along the butt crack? . the tares have been there for approx. ten years and the bloody stools started about five years ago along with the nickle size growth about three years ago.

people with ulcerative colitis benefit greatly from eating a healthy diet being active and getting enough sleep. taking care of yourself is of the most importance. there is not one specific diet for ulcerative colitis but here are some considerations for you. during times of active disease meaning you are having symptoms such as diarrhea or blood in your stool you may want to follow a low fiber diet to decrease stool volume. a low fiber diet would mean cooked fruits and vegetables instead of raw and refined grains over whole grains (whole wheat oatmeal brown rice). when your symptoms improve you can gradually add fiber-rich foods back into your diet. that being said you may find certain foods aggravate your symptoms. these foods might include alcohol caffeine containing beverages like coffee dairy products (if lactose intolerant) and raw veggies. for more foods that might bother you s ee this webmd article. i suggest you to keep a journal of your symptoms along with the foods you eat to figure out which items may be triggers. you may also benefit from seeing a leap certified dietitian to help you figure out which foods you are most sensitive to. to find a dietitian in your area go to eatright. org. the bottom-line is everyone is different and you need to develop an eating plan that works for you. good luck!	what to eat when you suffer from ulcerative colitis and can i drink milk as well
hi i think the answer is no if you read this its a piece i found may help may not. good luck you can get chlamydia through: unprotected vaginal sex unprotected anal sex unprotected oral sex your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals sharing sex toys when they are not washed or covered with a new condom between each person who uses them sexual fluid from the penis or vagina can pass chlamydia from one person to another even if the penis does not enter the vagina anus or mouth. this means you can get chlamydia from genital contact with someone who has the infection even if there is no penetration orgasm or ejaculation. it isn’t clear if chlamydia could be passed on by transferring infected semen or vaginal fluid on the fingers. infected semen or vaginal fluid can cause conjunctivitis if it gets into someone’s eye.	can someone be infected with chlamydia through other things besides sex? like needles razors etc.

bodily movements are regulated by a portion of the brain called the basal ganglia whose cells require a proper balance of two substances called dopamine and acetylcholine both involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. in parkinson's cells that produce dopamine begin to degenerate throwing off the balance of these two neurotransmitters. researchers believe that genetics sometimes plays a role in the cellular breakdown. in rare instances parkinson's disease may be caused by a viral infection or by exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides carbon monoxide or the metal manganese. but in the great majority of parkinson's cases the cause is unknown.	what causes parkinson's disease?
pregnant women with genital herpes should be careful about passing the virus on to the baby but not overly worried about it. a mother can infect her baby during delivery often fatally. but if a woman had genital herpes before getting pregnant or if she is first infected early in pregnancy the chance that her baby will be infected is very low -- less than 1%. women with genital herpes are examined carefully for any symptoms before giving birth. if sores or signs that an outbreak is coming show up at the time of delivery the baby may be delivered by cesarean section (also called a c-section). the risk of infecting the baby is high (30% to 50%) when a woman is newly infected late in pregnancy however. that's because the mother's immune system has not developed protective antibodies against the virus. women with an older herpes infection have antibodies against the virus which help protect the baby. if you are pregnant and you think you may have been infected recently tell your doctor right away.	what happens if a pregnant woman has genital herpes?

the allen test is used to check the health of the ulnar artery and other vessels in the hand that maintain normal circulation. it's executed by first allowing blood to drain from the hand. at the end blood flow to the hand is evaluated. first ask the patient to hold a clenched fist high in the air. at the same time the main arteries are compressed. by compressing the ulnar and radial artery you allow blood to drain from the hand. next lower the hand and open the fist. once pressure is release color should flow bak into the hand. this indicates that the ulnar vessel is healthy.	what is an allen's test?
tylenol and boniva are safe to take together or at different intervals throughout the day. however there are a few medications you should not take or should alter the time you take the doses while taking boniva. aspirin/nsaids can easily without one knowing damage the gastrointestinal (gi) tract causing irritation and possible bleeding. boniva is also very irritating to the gi system. therefore to reduce the irritation to the gi the medications should not be used adjunctively. remember there are over-the-counter nsaids as well as prescription nsaids. if an nsaid medication is required for another indication than fever timing is important. spread out the dose of boniva from the nsaid. remember to take boniva on an empty stomach and the nsaid with food even if you do not feel stomach irritation. work with your pharmacist and/or health care provider about timing and evaluating whether both medications should be maintenance therapy. boniva has a drug interaction with calcium supplements and antacids. these products can decrease the absorption of boniva decreasing the effects of the medication. it is not that you cannot take these products but rather about the timing. take boniva 60 minutes on an empty stomach prior to taking any calcium supplements and antacids.	i have a 100. 4 degree fever and i am planning to take boniva tomorrow. can i take tylenol to reduce fever with boniva?

very interesting question. the key here is genetics. to start with while it's true sickle cell disease is most commonly found in african-americans it's also found in africans people from the caribbean central and south america some mediterranean countries and people from india. sickle cell disease refers to an abnormality of the red blood cells that cause them to appear crescent-shaped instead of round. the disease is inherited; parents pass it to their children. when children inherit two sickle genes they have the disease. when a child inherits just one sickle gene they do not have the disease but can pass it to their own child if their partner also carries a sickle gene. so quite simply sickle cell anemia is commonly found in african americans because their ancestors have passed it on to them. the same is true of other diseases that afflict certain populations at a higher rate than others such as the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis -- which occurs most commonly among caucasians. hope this helps!	why is sickle cell anemia common in african americans?
i'm sorry to hear about your husband's skin cancer. that can certainly be a scary experience and you're wise to keep a close watch on his skin from now on. the cracking at the corner of your husband's mouth probably is not cancer but since he's had a skin cancer once it would be a good idea to get it checked out by a health care provider. often cracking at the corner of the mouth is a symptom of perleche or angular chelitis. this can be caused by a fungus (which can be treated by your health care provider) or by a vitamin b deficiency. however the symptom you're describing could be caused by many things including yes a cancer. that's why it would be best for your husband to be examined by your primary care provider. he or she can diagnose the problem and treat it accordingly. good luck to you!	my husband had skin cancer and now has a cracked lip corner that's not healing. could it be cancer has returned? . my husbandhad skin cancer. he now has a crack in corner of mouth that has not healed in 3 weeks. can this be sign cancer has returned?
that seems within the normal range. but what really matters is not one blood sugar level but the overall pattern. that's why its recommended you write down what you eat along with your blood sugar levels and show them to a diabetes educator. they work with you on modifying your diet to help manage blood sugars during pregnancy. for more on recommended blood sugar targets see this article.	diagnosed with gestational diabetes. my post prandial blood sugar is often 125 not 120. is that ok? . diagnosed with gestational diabetes. my post prandial blood sugar is often 125 not 120. is that ok?
what kind of hormones. there are many different hormones. if you are talking about estrogen (the female hormone) i would say that there is really no reason for any woman of her advanced age to need it but she can certainly talk with her medical provider. i am guessing that the answer will be the same.	should 87 year old woman take hormone pills
too advanced of a medical problem to identify you'd have to ask a medical professional that has studied psychiatry or a specialised nurse to get the best answer. no ordinary en or rn can answer that question so webmd is probably the worst place to come. i'd visit a psychiatrist and get examined schizophrenia is a very specific issue you could easily have something on the autism spectrum also these places are very specific the could be a drug or chemical like asbestos that could be causing this eventually wearing off when you leave. but honestly i know nothing about asbestos or mental disorders this is just my advice from a paramedics perspective.	do people with schizophrenia only hear voices while in there home or do they hear them everywhere they go. my nosey neighbors are trying to make me believe i am schizophrenic. that when i hear them speak they are not what i hear and in stead that they are voices in my head. . but i dont hear them when i am not at home! i know what i hear but its odd that few others hear it. do people with this sickness hear the voices they hear outside of there home where they generally hear them. like when at the store or the mall? because i dont have that. only when home. normal or schitzo?

people trying to conceive often wonder how long it takes for the effects of birth control medication to wear off. it's actually possible to become pregnant immediately after going off the pill -- as soon as the pill's hormones are out of your system -- although in many cases it will take a few months before ovulation begins normally again. you should also know that it's safe to conceive right after you go off the pill. women who conceive immediately after going off the pill are as likely to have a healthy baby as women who waited a few months in between.	what should i know about going off the pill and getting pregnant?
i would be reluctant to use medical marijuana on an elderly person who may have problems with memory and mental processing as it is. however a pain managment specialist may have different ideas. this 95 year old should really see a pain specialist so that his/her pain can be pharmaceutically managed taking into account all of there medical history. personally i have never prescribed it for these reasons. as a former pain pill addict and current medicinal user of cannabis i must respectfully disagree with the doctor. new research is showing that marijuana does not effect the memory in the ways previously thought. however i will admit the effects of marijuana on an elderly patient especially one that has never used it before may be a bit overwhelming. are you in a state where it is legal medicinally because it would be best to do under the care of a doctor considering the age factor. marijuana is a much safer form of pain control than traditional narcotics. it is also being shown to have benefits on numerous other conditions. you can always do the research if you have any doubts or concerns. also to answer your original question marijuana does not come in pill form there is a synthetic pill called marinol but it is not exactly the same as cannabis and is usually only prescribed for cancer patients. there is a variety of ways to reap the benefits of marijuana. i would suggest cannabis oil. a little bit placed under the tongue can go along way. there is also edibles such as cookies cakes and brownies but those tend to have a more psychoactive effect and may be a bit too overwhelming. smoking it is an option but with the patients age i would advice against this. if you are in a state where it is legalized for medicinal use talk with a doctor about your options. if unfortunately your in a state like me where its not you can always find all the information you could ever want or need online. just be careful and make sure you check the sources of the information your reading. also be careful of the law as i can personally attest to even if your just trying to use a safe alternate to treat your pain they will still treat you like a criminal. order 100% legit n safe medical marijuana pain relievers cbd oils dabs and more. for more info text (505) 807-7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com medical marijuana is good for your health top medical strains for all patients suffering from depression glaucoma anxiety and tension headaches chronic pain and nausea mental and physical fatigue and for calming aromatherapy then you are in the right place to look in our meds all top grade aa+ with high level of cbd and thc contact for your supply and good health. pain killers medical marijuana act. lean ***(( no prescribtion is needed))) bud seeds harsh oils dabs & other m. m treatments. we also sefely and securely deliver all sorts of generic medication and syrup nationwide at very good prices. no prescribtions needed. legit verified and reputed plug. available in the u. s canada australia and the uk. for more info text (505) 807-7504 lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com. thank you.	does a person get a high from capsule medical marijuana? does it dull pain or just make the pain tolerable? . could this help a 95 year old who is in severe pain from spinal stenosis and arthritis? does it really have any long term effects on memory?

you are experiencing a condition called erectile dysfunction (ed). there are many excellent medciations to rectify this problem. because this issue is new to you and there can be some underlying medical reasons it would be wise to see your medical provider or a urologist for a examination. besides ed meds are by prescription so you will need to get one. if medications are not what you want there are other erectile aids that can be used so please talk to your medical provider. both you and your wife will be pleased. my husband had this issue and as a woman i thought it was something i was doing or me in general. he had been under alot of stress we spoke with a dr. about it matter of fact a couple drs. and they all said that stress could lead to holding or getting an errection. he switched jobs and to be honest everything got alot better. lol i hope this helps.	i am unable to manitain an erection for long. it just goes a way in the middle of sex without warning. i don't exactly have a problem getting an erection. the problem is that i cant maintain it for long and i cant get another one after wards. sometimes i can maintain it longer then other times but never for long and never to finish. sometimes when i do maintain one for longer then other times and feel am about to finish it goes away with out warning. most times i just stop and give up or have to bring myself to almost finish. it's very frustrating for me and my wife.

i like that you still want to eat healthy even though you need to gain weight. i would say you should eat the same foods i would normally tell people to eat -- just more of them. stick to healthy foods like lean meats and beans whole grains healthy carbs like sweet potatoes and plenty of fruits and vegetables. since you need to gain weight you can include some of the higher-calorie foods in your diet like potatoes and pastas. it's easier to rack up the calories with carbs so eat up and enjoy. you could even splurge occasionally on sweets or other foods you crave. it's honestly fine for anyone to do that but you have a bit more freedom in your case. also if it's hard for you to eat a lot at one time eat more small meals throughout the day.	what kinds of healthy foods should i eat to gain weight?

modified cornstarch is starch that is physically/chemically treated to change its properties and is mainly used as a thickening agent stabilizer or emulsifier in various food products (as a food additiive and not for taste/nutrition). there are many different types of these starches around and they are considered safe. from a nutrition perspective this ingredient is harmless and not an issue. but if you are a purist and prefer natural unadulterated food and beverages than you might choose to avoid it.	is modified corn starch bad for you? . i like white tea and by the chance i looked at the ingredients and everything seemed normal except for the modified corn starch in it. so is modified corn starch unhealthy(bad) for you?

well technically yes you can take two 40mg pills instead of one 80mg pill but that just means you'll run out of medication faster. i suggest you consult your pharmacist to find out exactly what the cost difference is between the 40mg pills and the 80mg pills. you may find there's very little price difference at all. also i suggest you discuss the cost factor with your doctor. there may be an alternative medication he or she can prescribe that is less expensive. health care providers tend to be very sensitive to cost issues on the part of their patients so don't hesitate to bring this up with your doctor. wishing you all the best.	i take 40 mg pravastatin doctor wants it at 80mg. i can't afford new meds can i take 2 40mg tabs instead of the 80mg?

you should just go buy her a pregnancy test from the dollar store. all she has to do is pee on it and you will know.	pregnancy symptoms missed period sickness but nipple stimulations. not sure? . my girlfriend and i had protected sex 5 weeks ago. it was a day after her last period. we have had sex a few more times since then. before 4 weeks ago it had been 6 months since she had sex. now her period is late and she's feeling sick. she has recently started nipple stimulations to have larger breasts. i know that stimulations can induce labor so could that combined with a lot of recent stress the sudden sexual activity and a common cold or the flu account for the missed period?
you make a fair point. it's true that while the premiums are reasonable for people who qualify for a subsidy many plans do come with high out-of-pocket costs. you can decide to pay the penalty -- that is an option. just keep in mind that these plans allow you to obtain preventive services at no cost at the time of the visit. and if you have an accident or are diagnosed with a serious illness even the high deductible will be immeasurably less expensive than paying for care out-of-pocket.	with the subsidies my cost of health insurance premiums should be below $200 a month. . yet with $6 000 in deductibles it doesn't sound like i can afford to go to the doctors even if i need to. doesn't it make more sense for me to just take the $95 tax penalty and save $2 400 premiums and out-of-pocket expenses of $6 000? if i have to pay $8 400 each year toward medical expenses i cannot afford to live in my home of 23 years.

it is true that not all providers will be participating in all the plans offered through the marketplace. one of the ways insurance companies operate is by only contracting with providers who are willing to accept their terms. you may want to change providers to one who is in one of the plans offered in the marketplace. if you do not want to change plans you should compare what kind of out-of-network coverage each of the plans offers.	i was just informed by my healthcare provider that they aren't accepting any health insurance marketplace plans. . i live in the state of texas and that seems to be the shared opinion of this state and its health care clinics. what would you suggest i do?

i can't find any studies on eosinophilic esophagitis and bariatric surgery (gastric bypass) specifically so i don't know if it's been done before. however the fact your prospective surgeon said he wouldn't do it should be something of a red flag for you. i'd suggest you consult two or three other bariatric surgery specialists in your area to see what they say. you may find someone who has plenty of experience with the situation you describe and is willing to do the surgery or you may find they all advise against doing the surgery. then you'll have your answer. as you probably know there are many types of bariatric (weight loss) surgery besides gastric bypass. this webmd slideshow goes over several types of weight loss surgery. good luck to you!	is it possible to get gastric bypass surgery with eosinophilic esophagitis? . i have eosinophilic esophagitis and i am trying to get gastric bypass. i was told by 1 doc that i can't get it done because he doesn't know enough about the ee and might pose additional problems. any insight on this and has it been done before?

in my opinion. no. colds are caused by viruses and no particular foods or vitamin (including vitamin c) or minerals (including zinc) has been found to offer cold and viral prevention. eat well. get a balanced vegetarian diet. and take supplemental vitamins if you want. it is a proven fact that a healthy lifestyle will be more immunoprotective against diseases. but certainly never 100% in our world of germs.	i am vegetarian. i often still get a cold or sinus infection. will specific vitamins or foods help prevent this?
you mention that you have a family history of high cholesterol so you may just have a genetic predisposition to having high triglycerides and high ldl cholesterol. that doesn’t mean however that you shouldn’t try to do everything that you can through modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as diet and exercise to manage your levels. some suggestions to lower your triglycerides and ldl cholesterol levels would be to: • do cardiovascular exercise five times per week for thirty minutes or greater • lose weight if you are overweight or obese according to bmi • change dietary habits like reducing saturated and trans fat from your diet cutting out sugar getting more fiber getting more omega-3 fatty acids and drinking less alcohol if you drink • quit smoking if you smoke i really applaud your efforts to avoid getting on cholesterol lowering medication. continue to do what you can with diet and exercise and continue to follow up with your doctor on a regular basis. it might sound strange but i had triglycerides over 1000 and got them to normal range with lots of black tea and 5000 mg of epa dha (omega-3) fish oil supplements daily. the fish oil was at my mds advice but didn't seem to work until i started drinking plain black tea in place of water - 5 tea bags in 64+ oz water daily.	i have high triglycerides and high ldl's and i'm in excellent physical shape. how do i lower these levels without meds? . high cholesterol htn etc. all run in my family. i cut out red meats and non-whole wheat breads and pastas for about 6 weeks without any change. i would like to find a way to drop my cholesterol w/o going on meds. my entire family is on various cholesterol and bp meds but they're all overweight and refuse to diet/exercise. is this something i can beat w/o meds? if i continue on with high levels throughout my life would i be able to mitigate the risks of heart disease diabetes and so on?

you can see a rebound weight gain with any of the stimulants but it really happens for a short time and doesn't usually continue indefinitely. on the other hand we have seen compulsive binge eating in those with untreated adhd. eating disorders are common in adhd and are the result of untreated symptoms of impulsivity and distractibility. stimulants not only decrease appetite but also decrease the urge to binge in these cases.	i took adderall for nine years but quit because of the side effects. now i'm gaining weight like crazy. what can i do?

i had the exact same symptoms! i am an 18 year old female. i'm not sure which issue has caused the symptoms but recently i found out that i have a lesion in my brain and i also have hormone imbalances. i would recommend seeing your doctor. keep searching until you find the answers!	hi there. i would like to know what could be affecting me as i have never experienced such symptoms before. recently about 4 months i would say i have been experiencing chronic fatigue even when i do sleep for long hours i still wake up feeling tired. more recently i have been having severe headaches accompanied by nausea. i often get a metal taste in my mouth during the day but mostly when i wake up. i find it hard to concentrate and always have this anxious feeling. i am a 19 year old male and i find it strange to be experiencing such symptoms at my age
cancer-related fatigue is often made worse if you are not eating or drinking enough or if you are not eating the right foods. maintaining good nutrition can help you feel better and have more energy. the following are strategies to help improve nutritional intake: get plenty of protein. protein rebuilds and repairs damaged (and normally aging) body tissue. the best sources of protein include foods from the dairy group (8 oz. milk = 8 grams protein) and meats (meat fish or poultry = 7 grams of protein per ounce). drink plenty of fluids. a minimum of 8 cups of fluid per day will prevent dehydration. (that's 64 oz. 2 quarts or 1 half-gallon). fluids can include juice milk broth milkshakes gelatin and other beverages. of course water is fine too. beverages containing caffeine do not count. keep in mind that you'll need more fluids if you have treatment side effects such as vomiting or diarrhea. make sure you are getting enough vitamins. speak with your doctor about taking a vitamin supplement if you are not sure you are getting enough nutrients. a recommended supplement would be a multivitamin that provides at least 100% of the recommended daily allowances (rda) for most nutrients. note: vitamin supplements do not provide calories which are essential for energy production. so vitamins cannot substitute for adequate food intake. make an appointment with a dietitian. a registered dietitian provides suggestions to work around any eating problems that may be interfering with proper nutrition (such as early feeling of fullness swallowing difficulty or taste changes). a dietitian can also suggest ways to maximize calories and include proteins in smaller amounts of food (such as powdered milk instant breakfast drinks and other commercial supplements or food additives).	how does nutrition impact energy level when you have cancer?

"many aerobic exercises are also ""weight-bearing"" -- the kind where you stand on your feet and exercise. weight-bearing aerobic exercises include walking aerobics dancing tennis climbing stairs and running. weight-bearing exercise stimulates the cells that make new bone and boost bone strength. this is especially important for teenagers because your bone mass peaks between the ages of 25 and 30. adolescence is the time to build the strongest bones possible."	are weight-bearing exercises aerobic?
i had this prob in the past and it was a stye i alternated hot and cold and it brought the head out then it drained and went away after a couple of days	i have eye pain and redness but no drainage. what is this? . no drainage in either eye just red and painful. sometimes red eye drops resolve it but other occasions it makes it burn and makes the pain worse. the other eye had the same issue previously. had an eye exam and was sent home with reading glasses and was told i had eye strain. i've been wearing them for a month or more now and the same symptoms keep happening.
generally the older we get the fewer calories we need to stay the same weight. but age itself isn't really the issue. we tend to be less active as we get older which means we burn fewer calories. with less activity we also lose muscle. muscle burns a lot of calories throughout the day. so as we lose muscle our metabolism starts to plummet. this also subtracts from the number of calories burned during the day. so if you keep eating as much as you did before you became less active and started losing muscle mass you're most likely going to gain weight. the good news is that you can combat that weight gain by staying active as you age. i highly recommend exercise at any age. exercise is one of the most important things we can do -- especially as we get older -- to stay healthy happy and active.	do seniors need to eat fewer calories than middle-aged people?
social support is defined as the sum of all the relationships that make you feel as if you matter to the people who matter to you. studies have verified that a strong group of family members and close friends or a support system (doctors nurses other health care professionals) can help in coping with a chronic illness. in some cases having a strong social network is associated with greater compliance with medication regimens and the use of health services. when you are tied emotionally to those in your social network you can express your innermost feelings of fear insecurity and guilt and receive comfort from people who accept you -- just as you are -- with no strings attached. if you have no place that feels safe enough to let down your emotional defenses you may tend to keep your guard up all the time -- a negative cynical and sometimes defensive guard that masks the very problems you are facing. with increased social support you can alleviate the emotional distress of living with psoriatic arthritis and gain health benefits such as the following: greater sense of control. while you may have no control over your psoriatic arthritis having a group of supportive family members and friends is something you can control. greater resilience. through positive feedback and support from friends and family you can learn to buffer life's interruptions with effective coping skills instead of letting the moment's crisis overwhelm you. longevity. in study after study the findings are the same: people with many social contacts -- a spouse a close-knit family a network of friends religious or other group affiliations -- lived longer and had better health. those who had few ties with other people died at rates two to five times higher than those with good social ties. if your psoriatic arthritis has led to high anxiety isolation increased stress or depression talk to your doctor or a licensed mental health counselor. seeking help early on can help you avoid more serious problems associated with other mood disorders and chronic illnesses.	why is social support important with psoriatic arthritis?

most helpful answer it is never too late! i am a male and at 57 i was 50lbs over weight and hadn't done anything like exercise in more than 10 years. i got tired of feeling everything jiggle when i moved at more than a plod and started by paying attention to what i ate and going for a walk every day. i joined a 12 week weight loss challenge to help me and received advice on nutrition things like the balance of carbs proteins fats and fiber to consume daily sources of those essentials. how many calories to consume each day to lose weight based on my based metabolic rate and my weekly weight loss goal. for walking i started walking 30 minutes per day at lunch just around the office area. when i started i could only make a little over 1 mile in the 30 minutes. i increased the speed of my walking a little each week to increase the work rate and calorie burn. by the end of the 12 week challenge i had dropped 25 lbs. and could walk at a 5 mph pace for 30 minutes. twelve weeks later i had lost a total of 50 lbs and was doing walk/run (4. 5 mph walk/7 mph run) intervals for 30 minutes. so yes you can do it. just balance your food intake and start walking. according to the experts it is never too late to start an exercise program. they have worked with people in nursing homes who were unable to walk and got them walking again! get cleared by your doctor first to make sure you do not have any underlying health problems. start gradually. just walking at first and then you can join a gym and work with a trainer for a while. you will be surprise with the results. it is never too late to start exercising. it is important that you get a professional trainer to guide you in exercising. you can start with something like yoga which will not be too stressful along with brisk walking. once your body adjusts to this routine you can hit the gym for light weights too.	i am 54 (female) and have not excercised in years. is it too late to start and also see results? . is there such a thing as toning flabby areas at my age?
unfortunately you may need to wait until june. it would not be possible to determine the reason why you have never had a menstrual cycle over the internet. the causes are many and we do not know anything about your medical history or have any way of examining you. and yes pcos can be one of the causes to consider. a work-up may be expensive so waiting until june would be prudent.	why am i 19 and still haven't had a period? ! . i am 19 and have never had a period. pcos is very common in my family and i am wondering if that is what caused it or what. my husband and i really would like to start our family and have been trying to for the last two years and nothing has happened. i really need as much information as possible because i don't have insurance until june. thank you.
the vaginal area is very vascular and can bleed with minor trauma. sexual intercourse can create just enough localized trauma to cause light bleeding. this is no more concerning that a minor nose bleed when you have a cold but if the bleeding is severe or intercourse is unusually painful it would be best for you to be examined by your medical provider. it is not unusual to find small tears (fissures) as a result of sexual activity.	can a guys large penis make me bleed lightly after sex? . until yesterday i have not had sex for over four months and the new guys penis is significantly larger than i've ever had. . we used a condom. and it only lasted a few minutes because we did some foreplay earlier and he came within a few minutes. it hurt because it felt like my vagina was stretching (obviously) and when i got home i had to use the bathroom and when i wiped there was a little blood. it is. very. light. not even a flow just a few drops show up when i wipe.
at age 19 there is a very good chance that you have stopped growing. your growth plates may have already closed so the chance of you achieving more height may be futile. our height is genetically-determined for the most part so the day you were conceived your dna was already been programmed for your adult height. you can see an endocrinologist and get an x-ray to see if your growth plates have closed. if they have you are at your adult height now. there is nothing medically that can change this so don't waste money on unproven treatments or quackery. there are no rules that state a son will follow the height pattern of the father. you may end up splitting the difference between your parents. my mother was 61 inches tall; my father was 74 inches tall. i am 70 inches; my youngest brother is 63 inches and my oldest brother is 73 inches. my son is 75 inches.	i am male born in 1994(19). my height is 163 i wanna grow atleast 173. is that possible for me if yes than please tell? . my father and younger brother having height of around 170. my mother is having height of 157.
first off you want to check for signs of dehydration including fewer wet diapers less play sunken eyes sunken fontanelle (soft spot on baby's head) loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. the fact that your baby isn't eating enough for adequate growth is another consideration. six months is also the time to start solids which is important for development and nutrition. this webmd article discusses various causes of diarrhea in babies. i would contact your doctor to find out if he or she wants you to come back in or get referred to a gastroenterologist. i think your gut is saying something isn't right -- and that is very important in my book.	my 6mth old weighs only 12. 8 lbs and has had diarrhea for 3 weeks what tests could be done to help determine the cause. after the first week i took her to the doctor and they diagnosed her with ear infections. she started augmentin a week later i took her back because she was still having diarrhea and loss of apetite and fevers ranging from 99. 0 - 102. 7 rectally. her wbc was 9. 5 and they said it was probably a virus. now another week has passed and she isn't better. no fevers that i have noticed but she is having watery bowel movements about 6 times a day and is only eating about 16 oz of formula a day.

it starts with communication with your doctor and pharmacist. make sure you know why you are taking all of your medications. this way you can try to minimize redundancy. ask your doctor for recommendations regarding when to take each medication – it might make sense to take your “water pill” earlier in the day so you aren’t woken up at night by the urge to go the bathroom. ask you doctor if routine liver or kidney laboratory testing is appropriate. bring your medication list with you to every doctor’s appointment or emergency room visit. one of the biggest causes of medication errors or side effects is when doctors prescribe people medications that they don’t tolerate or when similar medications are already being prescribed. remember that supplements can have side effects and may interact with your medications – know what you are taking and why you are taking it. when making changes in your medications it’s best to make one change at a time – that way you can identify the likely cause if a side effect occurs. take advantage of the pharmacist’s offer to counsel you regarding new medications.	what steps can i take to reduce my risk of serious drug side effects?
cleansing your face should remain a simple process. the first step is to wash your face no more than twice per day with a gentle soap and warm water. step 2: exfoliate the dead skin cells with an exfoliating agent that contains a mild salicylic acid or glycolic acid. step 3: rehydrate your skin with natural oils that will not clog your pores such as almond oil or avocado oil. moisturizers should be applied lightly primarily to seal in the moisture but not to clog your pores.	what the right way to clean the oily skin on my face?
two things. once you have shingles (herpes zoster) you will always have it. the body's immune system will usually suppress it and keep in from breaking out but it will still be there. you will always have the potential for a recurrent outbreak but about half of the people will never see it again. shingles in not treated with antibiotics. it is a virus and viruses are immune to all antibiotics.	already had shingles can i get them again? . i was 19 yrs old when i first got shingles and became very sick from the antibiotics i was given for them. i am 37 now and because i was so young when i first got them i now wonder if i will get them again or is it like the chicken pox where once you get them you dont have to worry?

fresh fruits contain fructose also called “fruit sugar” which is naturally found in fruit. consuming a wide variety of fruit is essential in a healthy meal plan. it is recommended to eat 2 servings of fruit per day. one serving of fruit is equal to 1 piece of medium sized whole fruit or ½ cup of fruit that is cooked chopped or canned. below are some fruits that are lower in sugar. apples with the skin berries (blackberry raspberry strawberry blueberry) cantaloupe honeydew melon lemons and limes oranges peaches plums watermelon	what fruits can you eat and still keep healthy glucose levels? . i am prebiabetic. i hear you should eat fruit but doesn't that have sugar?
"the pregnancy risk is very small. but not ""zero"". while i commend your attempts to limit your sexual activity to mutual masturbation you have a responsibility to keep viable semen away. far away. from your female partner's genital area."	could my girlfriend get pregnant if the small amount of semen i had on my hand made contact with the vulva? . me an my girlfriend were performing manual sex and as we are youngish we have decided this is all we would do she performed a handjob on me and i cummed and then about 3 minutes after i rubbed her clitorus and vulva with my hand which (from what i remember) contained a slight bit of semen do i have a risk of pregnancy? she was not on her period or in the stages of ovulation.
our senses of smell and taste are intertwined. our ability to smell is what makes us able to “taste” the flavor of the foods we eat. many things can interfere with the ability to smell and taste. among the most common offenders include allergies nasal polyps and sinus infections. in these cases the loss of smell often comes on gradually. there can also be a gradual loss of smell and taste as we age. infections in the mouth may cause problems with both taste and smell as well. a sudden loss of smell is more likely caused by a virus (like the flu) or head trauma. zinc deficiency is also known to affect the sense of smell. some zinc nasal sprays on the other hand have been implicated in complete loss of smell. both alzheimer's and parkinson's disease can affect the sense of smell but other symptoms would likely be present first. rarely a tumor in the brain or sinuses can be the cause of a decrease in smell or taste. you will have to see your doctor to get to the bottom of this. and depending on the cause you may need to see an allergist ear nose and throat specialist or dentist to finally get some relief. good luck to you! whats cause you to loss taste bud no smells i havent been able to taste or smells in a while chronic sinus infection	i haven't been able to smell anything or taste for a while now what can be the cause for this?
insurance companies need to build their provider networks in advance of plans being released on the marketplaces so many doctors have already been approached by insurers and asked to join. many healthcare providers are now considering whether or not they'll choose to participate in those plans just as they would any insurance company network.	several of my doctors have said they will probably not be in network with marketplace plans. . i am wondering how they know if the plans have not yet been finalized.
your alternating dry-peeling beard area sounds more complex than one might expect on first glance. first use a simple non-irritating shave gel such as nivea or aveeno oatmeal. always shave with a nice sharp fresh blade. if your skin is peeling it is dry and irritated you may actually have a skin allergy. i would suggest you definitely see a dermatologist to set up a proper skincare regime. in the meantime avoid any scrubs with glycolic or salicylic acids as these will dry you further. when all else fails for dryness and flaking good old-fashioned vaseline may help. .	my skin is scaly especially with shaving. it is also becomes very dry from sun. is there a cream that can help this?
when children turn one it is recommended they switch from formula to whole milk or continue breastfeeding. children up to two still need more fat than older kids so unless directed by your doctor keep them on whole milk. it is recommended that children over two get no more than 24 ounces of milk per day (3 cups) to prevent iron deficiency anemia. too much milk can crowd out other nutritious foods in the diet so avoid allowing your child to sip on milk (or juice) and instead serve as part of meals and snacks and before bed. between 2-3 cups a day of whole milk for a one year old is fine.	1 yr old should drink how much 2% milk a day? . send answer to fred. strawder@msn. com
doctors will do an infertility checkup. this involves a physical exam. the doctor will also ask for both partners' health and sexual histories. sometimes this can find the problem. however most of the time the doctor will need to do more tests. in men doctors usually begin by testing the semen. they look at the number shape and movement of the sperm. sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones. in women the first step is to find out if she is ovulating each month. there are a few ways to do this. a woman can track her ovulation at home by: writing down changes in her morning body temperature for several months writing down how her cervical mucus looks for several months using a home ovulation test kit (available at drug or grocery stores) doctors can also check ovulation with blood tests. or they can do an ultrasound of the ovaries. if ovulation is normal there are other fertility tests available. some common tests of fertility in women include: hysterosalpingography (his-tur-oh-sal-ping-gogh-ru-fee): this is an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. doctors inject a special dye into the uterus through the vagina. this dye shows up in the x-ray. doctors can then watch to see if the dye moves freely through the uterus and fallopian tubes. this can help them find physical blocks that may be causing infertility. blocks in the system can keep the egg from moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. a block could also keep the sperm from reaching the egg. laparoscopy (lap-uh-ros-kuh-pee): a minor surgery to see inside the abdomen. the doctor does this with a small tool with a light called a laparoscope (lap-uh-roh-skohp). she or he makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. with the laparoscope the doctor can check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems. doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy. during this surgery doctors use a tool called a laparoscope to see inside the abdomen. the doctor makes a small cut in the lower abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. using the laparoscope doctors check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems. doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy. finding the cause of infertility can be a long and emotional process. it may take time to complete all the needed tests. so don't worry if the problem is not found right away.	how will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems?
you probably don't want to drop your employer's insurance. if your portion of the premium doesn't cost more than 9. 5% of your income you won't be eligible for a subsidy if you buy insurance on the marketplace. if you haven't already received a letter from your employer explaining that its health plan is considered affordable under the aca ask at work to make sure. you'll need to look for a plan for your parents separately on the marketplace. they may qualify for a subsidy. i would consult with one of the helpers available by phone at healthcare. gov.	i have employer insurance which includes my wife. . can i do away with that and apply on the marketplace and include my parents who are under 65 and do not qualify for medicare or medicaid (florida) and are dependent on me as they had no income in 2013?

researchers have had difficulty determining exactly what causes bacterial vaginosis. at present it seems to be that a combination of multiple bacteria must be present together for the problem to develop. bacterial vaginosis typically features a reduction in the number of the normal hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli in the vagina. simultaneously there is an increase in concentration of other types of bacteria especially anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that grow in the absence of oxygen). as a result the diagnosis and treatment are not as simple as identifying and eradicating a single type of bacteria. why the bacteria combine to cause the infection is unknown. certain factors have been identified that increase the chances of developing bacterial vaginosis. these include multiple or new sexual partners intrauterine devices for contraception recent antibiotic use vaginal douching and cigarette smoking. however the role of sexual activity in the development of the condition is not fully understood and bacterial vaginosis can still develop in women who have not had sexual intercourse.	what causes bacterial vaginosis?

hives do not spread when you scratch them (although there are types of hives that can be caused by skin pressure). most of the time hives are caused by something you have eating breathed or touched (i know. hundreds of possibilities) and will respond to oral antihistamines.	can you spread hives on yourself by scratching similar to poison ivy? . first time i've every had them. they're from a medicine reaction and i starting scratching without thinking! they're even on the palms of my hands. maddening! and i'm snowed in and won't be able to get a remedy for a day or so. any insight would be appreciated.

retin-a or tretinoin is very effective in reducing fine lines and wrinkles as well as evening out pigment and shrinking pores. it's really the only fda approved anti-wrinkle anti-aging cream that has years of scientific proof that it works. it takes several months to see the effects and should be used under the supervision of a board-certified dermatologist. it can cause dryness peeling and redness and should be used along with a moisturizer. i usually recommend cetaphil or olio lusso facial oil to mitigate the dryness. one should also apply it very sparingly at night and of course always wear sunblock during the day. it shouldn't be used with glycolic acid or other peeling agents. be patient see your dermatologist and you will see results.	how effective is prescription tretinoin. 05 on fine wrinkles and patches of rough skin? how long does it take?

there is two basic types of targeting dandruff with the dandruff shampoos; one is to eliminate the scale and one is to affect the underlying cause. somebody who has very thick scale and heavy dandruff you might need both products because until you get rid of some of the scale the active ingredient won't actually reach the skin to have the proper effect. so the first products to get rid of some of this scale would be something like salicylic acid that helps loosen the scale and eliminate it from the skin. the zinc pyrithione and the selenium sulphide target the underlying yeast or fungus that can cause the dandruff to begin with. so you might need both products and you can either use them one after the other or alternate one shampoo one and the next shampoo the other. afterwards you can still use your own shampoo if you prefer. so it's a lot of shampooing but for some people who really prefer their own shampoo or don't like the way these products smell you can still use your own shampoo after and you can certainly condition afterwards as well.	how do dandruff shampoos get rid of dandruff? what's the difference between selenium sulphide and zinc pyrithione?

i think the best thing to do is get a physical and lab work done. you need to check your hemoglobin a1c to see what your average blood sugar have been. you also could be anemic or dealing with another nutrition deficiency. here are some potential causes of being tired. you also want to check your diet to make sure you are eating right -- consuming regular meals with all the food groups and a carb-rich snack before your practices for energy. see this article for more on what to eat before during and after exercise. with some detective work you will discover why your body is not getting into the shape the way it typically does. listen to it it's trying to tell you something. good luck!	i've been running a ton but i cannot seem to get in shape. what's going on here? . i'm a college basketball player. i have t1 diabetes. i've never had a problem with getting in shape and staying in shape until this season. we run about fifteen suicides a practice and full court scrimmaging. but after two months i still get out of breath very quickly. we had off the other day and since i always feel so out of shape i decided to hit the tredmill to see if i could run a bit. i only was able to run about six minutes before i got tired. how come i'm not getting in shape?

as many times as you can become mentally aware of your behind and as you do contract your glutes. you can be standing in line walking up stairs or running to the bus. pay attention to how they feel as you move. in addition to strength training and good nutrition you need to be doing regular cardio (goal is to burn 400 calories each session) with intensity intervals. that means when you hit the hills by increasing your treadmill’s incline you’ll cook a ton of calories compared to simply walking on the flat. or ramp up the speed with which you walk. intensity intervals simply mean adding hills and/or speed every now and again to your workout. other butt blasters: backward leg toe touch and lift: stand behind a chair toes facing forward with both hands placed on top of the chair for stability. keeping both knees straight extend your left leg back pointing your toes with your big toe touching the ground behind you. gently lift your left leg about 30 degrees off the ground without bending your knee. tighten your glutes and hold for a count of 10. bring down and touch the ground with your pointed big toe and lift right back up for another count of 10. repeat this 5 times and switch sides. donkey kick crossover: grab a mat and get on all fours with your hands under your shoulders. keep your left knee and ankle flexed as you lift your knee to hip level behind you. hold for a count of 5 and bring down touching the mat briefly and lift again. repeat 5 times and switch sides. butt bridge: lie face up on a mat with knees bent and feet flat arms by your side. left hips slowly off the floor forming a straight line from knees to shoulders. tighten your glutes and maintain this bridge position for a count of 10. bring your butt down for 10 seconds and lift back up again into bridge position for a count of 10. see if you can do it for a count of 20. repeat 5 times. sizzling squat: stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. engage your core abdominal muscles. place your hands behind your head elbows out to the side. squat down never going beyond a 90 degree angle to your lower legs. for novices or anyone with knee issues just squat down enough to feel your glutes engage well and hold for a count of 3. as you stand up for an added twist rotate your trunk to the left and lift your bent left knee in front of you. return to squat again. switch sides and repeat. do this whole set 5 times. invisible chair wall squat: you can do this anytime and anywhere there’s a wall. standing straight place your back on a wall. squat down as previously described and imagine you’re sitting on an invisible chair. squeeze your glutes. hold for a count of 5-10 (or 20 for the advanced) and stand up. rest for 10 seconds and repeat 5 times.	what exercises will tone and and strengthen my glutes?
"i don't know what ""thing"" you are talking about. was it an instrument to clean out earwax and other debris or was it just the funnel-like tip of the otoscope (the instrument with the light). if your ears hurt during the exam. and still hurts the clinician most likely scratched or abraided the very sensitive lining of the ear canal. you may need some antibiotic drops so call this person tell him the story and have him call in a prescription for you. no sense in you paying for another visit unless he plans on doing it for free."	i went to an ent who put the thing used to look inside my ears too deeply inside them and they still hurt 3 days later. it was very painful at the time and i wish after the first ear i'd said something. this makes me very scared that the pain won't go away as i initially went to the doctor because my ears were getting more sensitive to certain frequencies and ringing but not in physical pain (which is now added). i just need to know if this is something that will go away in time.
having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman's life. women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early. this early planning process is called pregnancy planning. the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy related problems to the greatest extent possible. the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling. even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby. unfortunately many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation. pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy. the baby's organs begin developing as early as 17 days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period. some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant. others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience weight gain or abdominal enlargement. by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus. in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre-pregnancy planning. conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome. the status of the woman's immunity against german measles (rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) is also determined. women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving (see medical issues below). women who are not immune to varicella (chickenpox) can be vaccinated but should wait 30 days after vaccination before becoming pregnant. women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery. women with hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well.	what is pregnancy planning and why is it important?

well we have come a very very long way in technology for cleansing the skin and for taking care of our skin. so i have a feeling that if your grandmother used the products available today her skin would look even more young and more beautiful than it did in your eyes. we love our grandmas so they always look beautiful to us. but the newer cleansers are able to get the makeup off our skin without removing our natural oils and sometimes they can even add moisturizers into our skin before we even rinse off. so using the newer products will help your skin look younger and better and will help the products you put on afterwards penetrate more evenly which will be good for your skin as well.	my mom and my grandma had beautiful skin and washed their face with bar soap. why do i need a regimen to clean my face?

people are at increased risk of infection with tuberculosis (tb) when they: have close contact (such as living in the same house) with someone who has active tb which can be spread to others. active tb is very contagious. are health professionals who may care for people with untreated tb. live or work in crowded conditions where they can come into contact with people who may have untreated active tb. this includes people who live or work in prisons nursing homes military barracks or homeless shelters. have poor access to health care such as homeless people migrant farm workers or people who abuse alcohol or drugs. travel to or from regions where untreated tb is common such as latin america (countries in central america south america and the caribbean) africa asia eastern europe and russia. people who have an infection that cannot spread to others ( latent tb infection ) are at risk of developing active tb if they: have an impaired immune system. the immune system may be weakened in older adults newborns women who have recently given birth and people who have hiv infection some cancers or poorly controlled diabetes. have poor access to health care such as homeless people migrant farm workers or people who abuse alcohol or drugs. take some types of medicines such as long-term corticosteroids tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists (used to treat rheumatoid arthritis or crohn's disease ) or medicines to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ. have a chronic lung disease caused by breathing in tiny sand or silica particles (silicosis) or celiac disease. 2 have had gastric bypass surgery or a gastrectomy. are 10% or more under their healthy body weight. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what increases the risk of getting tuberculosis tb?
unfortunately i do not know the medical details of this gunshot wound to comment specifically. some wounds are sutured and some are not. if the clinician knows that there are absolutely no foreign materials (pieces of cloth dirt bullet fragments etc. then it may be closed. if a wound is sutured with even the tiniest piece of foreign material it is highly likely to get infected so many surgeons will leave it open to drain. if a sutured wound becomes infected it may need to be opened. if the wound is in an area that is cosmetic (face neck etc. ) then it should be closed. antibiotics are often appropriate since wound infections will complicate healing. i am not sure what type of specialist that is being seen now but since they have the ability to examine the person they are the ones who can best comment on the quality of care.	why would a gunshot wound in the arm not be stitched or sutured? . we took my son to the specialist 48 hours after the gunshot was treated in the er at a hospital. the specialists office was shocked that they left both of the wounds unstitched or sutured. he bled badly when the bandage was removed at the doctor. there was no evidence of iodine/beta dine on the wounds either. is this common because all our sources say it was not proper procedure. please advise us. he now has to be kept on antibiotics for an extended period of time. too late to stitch now!
constipation is a common problem that pregnant women have. and there are some things that they can do to help ease the constipation. the first thing is to probably change their diet. i am sure it's not something that a pregnant mom wants to hear because they want to have certain foods but by increasing your fibre intake having more fruit juices fresh fruit more water. water is a great substance that can actually help you ease your constipation. a lot of times pregnant moms are dehydrated because of the fact that they are not drinking enough during the day. so by making these little changes it will help. some minimal exercise. walking around a little bit more actually does a lot of great in helping constipation. there are stool softeners that are available. the common product is docusate sodium and that can be used by pregnant women but i would definitely recommend as a pharmacist that a pregnant woman check with their ob/gyn or healthcare provider first before starting that type of therapy.	how can i deal with constipation during pregnancy?
guar gum actually tries to make you feel like you are full especially when you eat a high fatty meal. the problem is that we have no data or evidence to show that it really really works and in some cases we've unfortunately found out that it does interact with prescription medications such as antidepressants and anti-seizure medications. so you want to avoid using this at all costs. we just don't have enough data. we already found out unfortunately through somebody ending up at the emergency room that it does cause these type of drug interactions. so if you have any questions ask your pharmacist. but also make sure you carry a medication list with you of all your medicines that you're taking both over-the-counter vitamins and prescription.	what does guar gum do for weight loss?

i would recommend an evaluation by an otolaryngologist (ear nose and throat specialist) regarding the sinuses. i would make sure to add sun protection daily since most wrinkles are caused by sun exposure over years. if you are sensitive to sunscreen look for chemical free sunscreens. these are not absorbed into the skin and should not have an effect on your sinuses. otherwise i would see your dermatologist about possible in-office procedures to help treat the wrinkles and determine the best approach for you.	i have a very sensitive system my skin included. most products seem to cause my sinuses to hurt. any suggestions? . i use only water occasionally cetaphil cleanser then olive oil and a little mary kay foundation. i'm 55 and getting too many wrinkles.
breath-holding spells are just a type of tantrum. while shocking to witness they are innocent and are likely to happen again until she gets out of her tantrum stage (about another year). clearly we can't give kids everything they want 100% of the time to avoid confrontation so you may see another one real soon. in this case your grand-daughter brought it on herself so make sure to point this out to her as a teachable moment. you will find lots of information on the internet regarding these breath-holding spells. hang in there grandma.	my granddaughter holds her breath when she cry's yesterday she fainted on me. how should i handle this. my granddaughter is 18mths and is now climbing on everything yesterday she fell off the chair no marks where left but do to the fact of being scared and hurt she holds her breathe when she cry's and therefor pasted out on me.

cerebral palsy can be so variable that without knowing the details of his particular cp involvement it would not be possible for me to offer you a specific answer but generally a teenager with cp can play sports. i admire you for being concerned and cooperative. it was be best for his medical provider to sign a medical clearance -- someone who knows his case. many kids with cp perhaps because of the muscle involvement with this disorder may become more fatigued. if he has some underlying respiratory or cardiac problem then this will need to be evaluated by his medical provider before clearing him for sports participation. kids with cp should be supported and encourage to do many activities so if he can make the team i don't think you will need to worry about his safety any more than the other kids.	is it safe to allow a tennager who has cerebral palsy to play basketball? . i coach a basketball team for high school aged kids and one of my players has cerebral palsy. he played on the team last year but we were very concerned about his condition and his safety but his parents seemed to have no problem with him playing. my coaching staff and i were very concerned about how safe it would be to allow him to play again this year as last yer he could not stay on the court very long without looking very exhausted. is it safe to continue to let him play?
gripe water is something that i would consider more of a home remedy. it was around for sometime and believe it or not the formula has changed over the years. it has been used to treat colic or gassy babies but it is over-the-counter and it's not really well-known whether or not it works. there were no studies done there is no advocacy studies done either. my concern as a pharmacist is that it does can sometimes contain things like alcohol it contains dill oil sodium bicarbonate sugars this could cause the baby may be to become a little more cranky. actually if i think about sugar a little more hyper may be not sleeping as well. so to be honest with you as a pharmacist my recommendation would probably be to not use it or also talk to your pediatrician and find out that something they really want you to be using with the baby.	what is gripe water?

your concern is right. the drug serax-d a combination of serratiopeptidase and diclofenac potassium should not be advised in case of pregnancy or with lactation. although it does cause problems like diarrhea bleeding and rash data is lacking regarding safety in such kids. this may be the personal experience of your gynecologist as they may not have seen any bad effects and so they are using it. but according to literature we should not use it. there is no clear indication of this medicine in your case. use of antibiotics and analgesics can heal the wound. so my conclusive advice is to stop serratiopeptidase and continue the rest of the medicine. please discuss my opinion with the treating doctor and stop the medicine with consent. a little advice for the baby's weight; breastfeed her until six months of age. do not use formula feed. after six months start a cereal-based diet to ensure adequate weight gain. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	"Hello doctor,My wife is 27 years old. Her weight is 60 kg and height is 5'4"". She developed a wound on her left thigh a few days back. We ignored it at first. Later, the surrounding area started swelling. Now, the swelling has reached till the lymph nodes. We went to a gynecologist here. She told that lot of infection had developed. The doctor prescribed Taxim-O 200 (Cefixime) to be taken in the morning and night along with Metrogyl 400 (Metronidazole) three tablets a day and Serax-D (Serratiopeptidase and Diclofenac potassium) to be taken in the morning and night. My wife is currently breastfeeding our 5 months old baby. So, we asked the doctor whether those medications are safe during lactation. She told that it is fine. However, based on what I read on the internet the first two tablets are moderately safe during lactation and may not pose any significant risk to the baby, whereas the third one is contraindicated during lactation. As per the doctor, the third medicine is required for her cure and is safe to take. Can you let me know whether the medications are safe to take during lactation? Can my wife continue breastfeeding normally? Our baby does not take powder milk and was vomiting when we tried bottled milk in the past. We need your valuable inputs. My wife does not have any other medical conditions. Our baby was born underweight (2.2 kg) and is currently 5.4 kg. Other than the low weight, she is usually active."

it's hard to tell what might be going on without more information. for example if you use any type of hormonal birth control (pill intrauterine device) this can influence your cycle. also if your periods occasionally have been irregular in the past this could just be part of the pattern for you. even if your periods have been very regular it's still not unusual for any healthy woman to experience some variance in her cycle. are you by any chance athletic? are you very lean (have low body fat)? do you have an eating disorder that causes you to be very thin? any of these things can cause you to stop having periods. if you're not having any other symptoms such as fever pelvic pain or anything like that then my suggestion would be to wait it out. if your period doesn't come after a couple of weeks you can make an appointment with a gynecologist for a check-up just to make sure nothing abnormal is going on. hope this helps!	im a 18 year old female and i never haf sex yet and my period is a week late. what can be the problem? . i never had sex
pregnancy is always a tough one and the one thing i can tell you is that the recommendations are usually for lifestyle modification. pregnant women should modify their diet. i know it's hard because they want to have certain foods usually spicy but they need to cut down on these particular items. they need to really eliminate caffeine from their diet as well this will really help with the heartburn problem. if needed their ob/gyn may recommend a calcium tablet like a tums which they can chew during the day. but they want to be careful for the amount that they chew because there are calcium limits in pregnant women. antacids that contain sodium bicarbonate should not be taken by pregnant women because they can lead to fluid retention. some doctors recommend the prescription drug sucralfate for treating chronic heartburn during pregnancy. but remember women who are pregnant should talk to their doctor before using any over-the-counter or prescription drug. by talking to the pharmacist telling us your symptoms advising us that you are pregnant we will be more than happy to help you understand your options.	are there any heartburn medications that are safe to take during pregnancy?
it's starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot. in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast. i don’t always do well with things that are slow. however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you don’t have to think about it again until it’s time to eat. here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock-pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush. the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients. this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat. these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken. (by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats. so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that — or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat. ). when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily. and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone. if you’ve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely you’ve participated in the biggest mistake: do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker. period. ever. using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie. canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can. cooking them for another 6-8 hours will disintegrate them. potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker. using canned tomatoes is fine — mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well. absolute no-nos: canned green beans canned corn and canned peas. actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it. under-seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time. since the food is cooking there for so long — the equivalent of a long slow boil — there needs to be a few levels of flavors. there are a couple ways to do this. if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest sautéing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot. the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step. also add fresh-cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly. add ingredients that are high in flavor. for example fire-roasted tomatoes or fire-roasted chilies. another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat. a half piece of bacon has about 1. 5 grams of fat depending on the size. not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor. can you tell i’m a fan of bacon? here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup. take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken. for every four cups of water throw in a 1-2 inch piece of ginger root and about 4 whole garlic cloves. then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high. at the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon. the slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldn’t experience if it was cooked quickly. and not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone. you can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast. throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night. you can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots — these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor. yes it’s slow but worth the wait. enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us. i want to see crock pot what it looks like most foods that are cooked in hard bottom in covered pot can be cooked fast with high heat according the type of food	how can my crock pot help me make fast healthy food?

there is a moderate interaction with one of the components found in janumet (metformin/sitagliptin) and zantac (ranitidine). ranitidine is a cationic drug and theoretically could decrease the excretion of metformin. this drug interaction has been observed when using another cationic medication cimetidine. because of this we use caution with similar medications. these interactions can increase the risk of lactic acidosis which included symptoms of malaise myalgia respiratory distress hyperventilation slow or irregular heartbeat somnolence abdominal upset or other unusual symptoms. lactic acidosis is a possible side effect from the metformin. consult your health-care professional if both of these medications are being prescribed together. monitor your reactions for side effects of lactic acidosis and stop medication right away if the symptoms occur.	can janumet and zantac be taken together?

there could be a link between chlorophyll usage and hair loss / fertility issues. but the bottom line is that there is no scientific evidence through verifable studies proving that chlorophyll will cause hair growth or impact conception odds. with that said chlorophyll seems to have many possible beneficial properties. it may be a worthwhile time investment to discuss chlorophyll usage with your physician before its purchase and consumption. chlorophyll is found in green leafy vegetables and may be located in liquid form throughout health food stores. many natural medicine proponents claim that chlorophyll is a detox agent effective in heart health and protects against cancer. other claims include improvements in digestion bad breath body odor and gas conditions. specifically mentioned as effective in hormonal balancing according to the encyclopedia of natural medicine women taking chlorophyll experienced correction in conditions such as delayed menstruation and p. m. s. additionally menopause symptoms such as dry skin irritability depression and hair loss also showed improvement. in summary it’s worth some additional research and talking with your doctor about chlorophyll claims. although there is no scientific evidence of chlorophyll causing hair growth or stimulating conception some natural medicine experts cite menstruation improvement and a reduction of hair loss.	does chlorophyl help hair loss and fertility

this is a good question but it should be made clear that regulations around supplemental medicare plans known as medigap have nothering to do with the health reform law. medigap plans can be difficult to change over time because when you purhcase one outside of a certain timeframe medigap plans can take the state of your health into consideration when deciding whether or not to sell you a plan and for how much. so you can certainly inquire about changing plans and you should but understand the challenges you may face. i suggest you talk with a medicare counselor for personalized assistance with this matter. contact your state health insurance assistance programs (ship). to find the ship near you visit the medicare helpful contacts page on medicare. gov or call (800)medicare or 800-633-4227.	i am disabled due to a lung transplant. i am 62 years old. i am on social security medicare insurance (a&b) have my part d through humana and i have a supplemental policy through american family. how hard will it be for me to change my supplemental insurance to a different company and when can i change?

this depends on a few things. if you exercise first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon you could quickly follow up with a healthy breakfast or dinner. if your workout is during non-meal time it's best to have something to replenish your muscle carbohydrate stores (called glycogen) with a little bit of protein for muscle repair and synthesis. research shows that eating foods with a combination of carbohydrates and protein is best (4:1 ratio) for recovery. here are some examples: whole wheat toast with peanut butter fruit with nuts and seeds (trail mix) apple with nut butter fruit smoothie with added protein yogurt topped with nuts chocolate milk (research has shown this to be a great recovery drink) granola/protein bar with the right combination of carb and protein for more on what to eat before during and after exercise see this webmd article.	if i am feeling really hungry after exercising what is the best thing to eat after a workout? . and i am a guy not sure if that matters.

you can start with his primary care provider but a pulmonologist is the lung specialist that he may eventually need to see. there are many many different causes of a cough so see the primary care provider first. hi things to think about can he remember what product he was using when this first showed up? i think your find his myocarditis was from the pneumonia from what i can read about it. below is some info i have found about his problem and i think this has transgressed from there. chemical pneumonia is an unusual type of lung irritation. pneumonia usually is caused by a bacteria or virus. in chemical pneumonia inflammation of lung tissue is from poisons or toxins. only a small percentage of pneumonias are caused by chemicals. many substances can cause chemical pneumonia including liquids gases and small particles such as dust or fumes also called particulate matter. some chemicals only harm the lungs; however some toxic materials affect other organs in addition to the lungs and can result in serious organ damage or death. chemical pneumonia is only one type of lung inflammation. other types of lung infections are viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. chemical pneumonia is a type of lung irritation. many substances can cause chemical pneumonia including liquids gasses dust fumes and lung aspiration. symptoms and signs of chemical pneumonia include burning eyes lips mouth throat dry cough nausea abdominal pain chest pain headache and pleuritis. treatment of chemical pneumonia depends on the toxic and amount of exposure. hi for me unless he’s the boss then this is his health were talking about time for a new start in another job away from chemicals fumes dust and all the rest that goes with the job working in a body shop. if you love your husband like you do then there is no other way he can go he may have a big love for his job but his job in slowly killing him . has he thought of still being in the industry but working from the other side ie not in the workshop. its either this or he works in a full face mask which would be fed by oxygen so he’s breathing clean air all the time he is in the workshop this could be a way out for him to carry on working in a body shop. as for finding what was the cause then that's how this answer started. do hope this helps in some way good luck hi his first call would be his own doctor and let him/her take it from there its either that or get him to an er. does he not wear a dust mask at work with all this dust? he really needs to watch this i had a college many years ago a tiller just as dusty he went off one and we never sore him again his close buddy when he come back said he was dead it was from the dust it had built up in his throat causing it to close end of story. so please be warned. good luck to add to the question yes he uses a dust mask at work however the fumes and dust do not get completely caught by the mask. in 2004 he was hospitalized due to a combination of pneumonia and working in the body shop. basically the pneumonia didn't get better and developed into myocarditis and he wound up in the heart unit at the local hospital over christmas. it all started with a cough much like the one he has now. he was put on all kinds of antibiotics for bronchitis and pneumonia but none of them seemed to work and he was put on an inhaler at one point which made his heart race and eventually led to me taking him to the e. r. at 4 in the morning on christmas eve where we were told he was having a heart attack at the ripe old age of 28. later it was discovered that it was not a heart attack but myocarditis. we are trying to get to a specialist sooner rather than later on this and find out if he is just allergic to the chemicals in the paint/primer that is used and if so what can be done about that. a change in careers isn't really an option so we need to find some answers at this point. all suggestions are appreciated. thanks.	what doctor to see for chronic cough. my husband is a bodyman (collision repair on automobiles) and works all day with paint and primer fumes as well as the body dust that goes along with his profession. he has developed a constant cough - he can barely complete a sentence without coughing. it sounds like a bronchitis cough but always gets better over the weekend when he's not at work. then by lunchtime on monday it's back with a vengeance and he's coughing all the time. what type of doctor should he see for this cough?
"it's tough to use the term ""cure"" for any chronic medical condition whether it's bipolar disorder (or as you put it ""manic depression"") or osteoarthritis. as you point out these conditions often can be managed through medication. when i say ""managed "" i mean the symptoms of the condition can be minimized. however these medications do not ""cure"" the condition because if you stop taking the medication then the symptoms return. with bipolar disorder it's important to take medications daily and to check in with your psychiatrist or psychologist on a regular basis. while a person with bipolar disorder may need to take medications for the rest of his or her life the dosage may need to change or the medication itself may need to be changed. new medicines are always coming on the market and often new-generation drugs not only work better than older ones but have fewer side effects. if anyone tries to convince you there's a ""cure"" for bipolar (""manic depression"") you should politely ignore them. do not allow anyone to talk you into going off your medications. there is no cure for bipolar. you should keep taking your medicines and rely on your doctor's expertise and advice. wishing you well! there is no cure for manic depression but there are very effective and natural way for managing the symptoms such as mood swings and helping you get back to a normal routine. learn more from the mr. mahendra trivedi at ""the trivedi effect"" about natural and effective ways and options for manic depressive disorder."	is there a cure for manic-depression? . besides controlling it's effects with medication on daily basis.

the hpv vaccine is not a birth control medication in any way. a vaccinated woman can still get pregnant but they won't likely get hpv which can lead to cervical cancer. so far the vaccine is 100% protective. there are very few if any side effects of this vaccine (your doctor can provide you with a full disclosure). most side effects are related to the shot itself (pain redness at the injection site) not the vaccine. the vaccine is safe and highly-recommended by medical professionals.	is hpv vaccine concidered to be a birth controll medication? and what are some other side effects

seventy percent of teens diagnosed when they are younger continue to have symptoms of their adhd that affect their functioning as adolescents. once your son stops taking his medication (concerta) his symptoms will return relatively quickly. unless he has learned other compensatory techniques or has outside help his symptoms will affect both his academic performance in school and his relationships with others. if he is driving he may have more difficulty focusing and with distractibility. teens with untreated adhd tend to have more car accidents and get more speeding tickets. all of this should be explained to him and i would suggest that he go in for a visit to discuss this and his decision to stop his medication with his health care provider. i often use this situation as an opportunity for the teen to learn more about how his adhd affects him and why or whether he need to continue his medication to treat his symptoms.	my 17-year-old has stopped taking concerta after 10 years. what affect will this have on his adhd?

the classic symptom of genital herpes is a cluster of small fluid-filled blisters that break forming painful sores that crust and heal. this process can take several days. but some people get only a rash or small bumps on the skin that appear to be pimples. still others have different symptoms such as painful urination and some women have fluid discharge from the vagina. sores may appear four to seven days after a person is first infected. flu-like symptoms including fever and swollen lymph glands in the groin may also follow the initial infection. symptoms come and go with no set pattern. one person may have an outbreak once a year while another may have one every few weeks. before a flare-up a person may notice an itching tingling or burning sensation in the affected area and there may be sharp pains in the pelvis or down the leg. herpes sores are usually worst the first time they appear. in later outbreaks the sores tend to be less painful and last for a shorter period of time. the symptoms of genital herpes can affect any of the following places on the body: penis scrotum vulva vagina anus urethra thighs buttocks. however many people with genital herpes never have symptoms or they mistake them for another malady such as: a vaginal yeast infection jock itch insect bites hemorrhoids an ingrown hair.	what are the common symptoms of genital herpes?

"a number of medical associations and organizations have made recommendations on screening for thyroid disease. some of the recommendations are listed below: all women who are planning a pregnancy should be considered for screening of thyroid disease. all pregnant women with a goiter (enlarged thyroid) high blood levels of thyroid antibodies a family history of thyroid disease or symptoms of hypothyroidism should be tested for hypothyroidism. in women who are borderline or sub-clinical hypothyroid and who also have positive antibodies -- which may indicate an ongoing autoimmune thyroid destruction -- therapy with low dose thyroid hormone at the onset of pregnancy may be beneficial. there is some evidence that the antibodies that may contribute to hypothyroidism can play a role in pregnancy. data suggest that selenium supplementation may be of benefit in women with high antibody levels at the time of preconception. this should be reviewed with your doctor. women who are on thyroid hormone replacement before pregnancy should also be tested to make certain that their levels are appropriate. during pregnancy the medication dose required may increase by up to 50%. increases may be required as early as in the first trimester. dosing is dynamic during pregnancy and should be closely monitored by regular blood testing. as the pregnancy progresses many women require higher doses of hormone replacement. the dosage of thyroid hormone replacement during and after pregnancy should be carefully monitored using the blood thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) value. the laboratory ranges for normal tsh are quite wide. most clinicians like to keep women who are pregnant and on replacement in the ""hyper"" end of the normal range. this usually equates to a tsh of 2. 0. many clinicians prefer tsh in the 1. 0 range. in women with hypothyroidism before conception most go back to their pre-pregnancy dose of thyroid hormone within a few weeks to months. it must be stressed that these are only guidelines. the management of each woman's situation is considered individually after consultation with her doctor. the benefits of treatment extend not only to pregnant women with hypothyroidism but also to their children."	what can be done to avoid the consequences of hypothyroidism in pregnancy?

tattoo removal has come a very long way and we have advances in our lasers to help remove tattoos of all different colors. typically the longer the tattoo and if it's a simple black tattoo those are the easiest to remove. once you get into the red and the yellow and the green colors it's a little bit more complicate and sometimes we can't entirely remove it and certainly not without leaving a mark behind. so the risk is that it takes multiple treatments. sometimes 10-20 treatments. the treatments can be painful and it can get costly and there's still a risk of having a scar left behind. so if you really don't hate the tattoo i would recommend trying to learn to love it but if you really do want to have it removed i would find a dermatologist that specializes in tattoo removal. you can do this by going to the american academy of dermatology website or the american society of dermatologic surgery website and look for doctors that specialize in those treatments.	i have a tattoo that i want to get removed by laser. how do choose a reputable place and how many treatments do i need?
yes. most women who have an ectopic pregnancy have subsequent normal pregnancies and births. if a fallopian tube had to be removed you can still get pregnant since the remaining fallopian tube should function normally. discuss the timing of your next pregnancy with your health care provider. some health care providers recommend waiting a certain amount of time (from three to six months) before trying to conceive again. taking time to heal both physically and emotionally after an ectopic pregnancy is important. above all don't blame yourself. counseling is available to help you cope with your loss. pregnancy loss support groups may also be a valuable resource to you and your partner. ask your health care provider for more information about counseling and support groups.	can i get pregnant after i've had an ectopic pregnancy?

this morning it was cold foggy and drizzling. i lit a fire while i was making breakfast for my daughter. we talked about how it was the perfect stay-home-and-have-hot-chocolate-watch-a-movie day. my restaurant is closed on sunday. so the driving force of my day is to clear my mind free of business stress and enjoy the comforts of home. while zoning out a bit on a reality show about bridal dresses i let my mind wander to what i should make for dinner tonight. i like to keep our sunday dinners easy to prepare comforting healthy and delicious. on the menu for tonight will be a version of my tuscan chicken soup from mom-a-licious. i love this soup because it is so satisfying can be prepared in under 30 minutes and provides leftovers that will last through the week. i am going to take on the more lengthy preparation because i have the extra time today. i will cook a whole natural chicken to make the broth and the meat for the soup. the smell that fills the house as the stock simmers through the afternoon is pure heaven and aromatherapy that brings about memories of childhood and my grandmother. i boil an entire chicken in a large pot without cutting or quartering the chicken. i cover the chicken with two inches of water. i bring it to a boil and then turn down to a simmer. i cook mine with cut up onion carrot and whole pieces of garlic for extra flavor. i leave it simmering for 1-2 hours depending on the weight of chicken. when the chicken is done you can pour all the broth through a strainer. let the chicken cool for a few minutes. if you prefer put on kitchen gloves and pull the meat off the bones (it comes off very easily) and discard the skin and bones of the chicken. after the broth is done i will add the pulled chicken rinsed canned italian white beans and kidney beans (you can add any type you like) and a can of crushed organic tomatoes. fresh basil and dill will be added. i’ll stir in finely chopped carrot and celery toward the end (so it retains a bit of a crunch). then i’ll serve it with freshly grated parmesan cheese and warm bread. i’m going to go curl up on the couch with a good book and my daughter wait for the approaching dinner hour and smell the delicious aromas that promise a hearty healthy dinner.	how can i make an easy chicken soup?

you do have the right to file a formal appeal with your insurance company to gain coverage for brand-name prescription drugs. you'll have to demonstrate that medically you're unable to tolerate the generics on your plan's formulary. talk with your doctor about your condition and the likelihood that you'd react better to a different medication. then ask about getting his or her help filing an appeal with your insurer. the goal is for your doctor's office to provide supporting medical evidence as to why you cannot tolerate the medications you're currently taking or have access to via your plan and why you need coverage for treatment better suited for you. good luck!	why do generic drugs make me cough? . i take meds for a thyroid condition and blood pressure meds. i have tried several different generics. the all have caused a constant cough. insurance c won't cover the brand names. i am paying more than $500. 00 per month for my meds.

poison ivy on the skin is not contagious. it will not spread from one area to another even it if is touched nor will it spread to another person. it can seem to spread since areas with more exposure out first and areas that were lightly exposed may break out days later. assuming that the skin has be washed to remove the original plant oil it will not spead. it is the plant oil that is the problem not any oozing from the skin lesions. it does not need to be wrapped but you can cover it lightly to keep the drainage contained.	can you wrap poison ivy in gauze so not to spread. its on both arms and its hard to not touch it on things can it be wrapped at night while i sleep and for how long can it be wrapped
most helpful answer the most likely cause would be an infection. either a urinary tract infection or a vaginal infection. in your case it could be both. the urge to urinate is a primary symptom of a urinary infection but urethritis (irritation of your urethra) from vaginitis could also cause this annoying symptom. you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.	"what does it mean when i have vaginal milky white fluid as well as a burning sensation and constant need to urinate? . well this just started today (being july 20th) and i wake up to the dire need to urinate but when i use the bathroom i see a light milky fluid coming out my vagina and the burning sensation when i pee. the milky white fluid doesn't smell like anything and every time i have the urge to pee nothing comes out. i've so far ""peed"" 4 times in the matter of 5 minutes. what's going on?"
your baby either has a cold (viral infection) or is teething. or both. babies often have a difficult time dealing with drainage either saliva or mucous when they are lying flat so a cough is important to clear their airway. coughing can certainly be a sign of something more serious (bronchiolitis rsv pneumonia etc. ) because your baby is immunocompromised due to age so it would be best to have a medical provider listen to those little lungs. there is very little you can do at this age to control a cough but you can make it easier for them to swallow excess mucous by using a cool mist humidifier in the room and sucking out nasal mucous using a special bulb syringe. a drop of saline in each nostril just prior to aspirating it will help loosen any thick mucous.	my 9 month old baby is coughing really hard while sleeping
he can shop for a health insurance plan through the marketplace -- he certainly doesn't have to hold onto cobra. but if your company offers spousal coverage he likely won't qualify for a tax credit even if your income would otherwise qualify him. still it's worth shopping to see what's available and to compare all your options before settling on any one plan.	i have health insurance paid by my employer. . my husband was laid off in july but his severance package covers him until the end of november. if i add him to mine or we take cobra is it going to cost a ton? can he enroll as an individual or do we have to add to mine or take cobra?

sorry you're experiencing this. it sounds unpleasant! unfortunately it's impossible to say what's going on without a physical examination. it's possible this is a boil in which case i would advise not popping it (which can allow bacteria to enter the wound and further infect your arm) but rather putting warm (not hot! ) moist compresses on it to draw out the pus. if you are running a fever or have any of these other health conditions you should see a doctor: heart murmur diabetes use of an oral or inhaled corticosteroid such as prednisone budesonide (symbicort) or fluticasone (advair) or if the bump doesn't heal up on its own with 10-14 days i wish you the best of luck with this!	what is this big bump on my arm that keeps getting more and more puss? . it is a large red bump that keeps getting more puss after i pop it and remove the puss.
"the primary difference is the way albuterol is propelled from the canister into the lungs but some patients will notice that the ""blast"" of spray is gentler with hfa devices.

simply eating a balanced healthy diet will support your body in building white blood cells. there are no specific foods you can eat that will speed up the process. making white blood cells requires a supply of nutrients including amino acids and purines. beans peas spinach and lean protein (like chicken and fish) are rich in these nutrients. however even relatively poor diets provide adequate material to make a normal white blood cell count unless something else is wrong. a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) is not due to inadequate nutrition except possibly in cases of extreme starvation. people with leukopenia have either a high rate of destruction of white blood cells or the body is limited in making them for some other reason. eating a healthy diet won’t build white blood cells faster but does have many other health benefits.	how can i build white blood cells with food?

there are a several important points to consider with your question. if your uterus was surgically removed but you still have your ovaries this does not mean that you have reached menopause. when the ovaries are left intact following a hysterectomy they may function normally and produce hormones for years to come. in which case the absence of menstruation would not mean that you are in menopause. or the ovaries may stop hormone production within a year or two after the hysterectomy and lead to an earlier menopause than would normally be expected. the relationship of menopause to high blood pressure (hypertension) is complex and not fully understood. however there are some studies that suggest that declining estrogen levels may influence the lining of the blood vessels and contribute to increases in blood pressure. researchers continue to review the relationship between menopause and blood pressure. you also mention that you have gained weight. you do not mention if you are overweight but weight is also related to the risk of hypertension. excess body weight is a known risk factor for the development of hypertension and gradual weight gain throughout life has been correlated with the increase in blood pressure that occurs with aging.	i gained weight after having my uterus removed now have borderline high blood pressure. is this linked to menopause?

the description of the history indicates your son might be having some psychological stress disorder oppositional defiant disorder (behavior problems) or depression. you might consult with a pediatric psychiatrist for your son who might be able to examine him and provide proper counselling and specific treatment.	my 9 year old son has become distant distracted disobedient and agressive. at first i thought he was just acting out but now it's different. he constantly is lost in his own world. i have tried to talk to him but all i get is an ok or when i ask him what is wrong he says he doesn't know. his answer for everything is i don't know or i don't remember. he has started banging his off of the wall or table he is emotionally withdrawn. he doesn't care about his punishment. it's as if he has forgotten everything. i can tell him to do something and if=n five minutes he will ask what he was supposed to do. it's as if instead of progress with age he is going in reverse. he constantly asks if we love him and if we want him there. i am out of options i do not know what to do. discipline just doesn't seem right. it's as if he honestly doesn't remember things. but also if he watches a cartoon one time he can act it out from memory. help. i need answers

scarlet fever is caused by strep. it would not be likely that this person would still be contagious months later unless of course they are a strep carrier. people can get exposed to strep quite easily by other people or from objects that area contaminated by strep. the only way you will know for sure if you have strep is to be tested.	if someone i know had scarlet fever months ago could they still be carrying the bacteria and be infectious? . while my tonsils are not very swollen the pockets that they sit in are. i've never seen that before and i always look when i have a sore throat. i was in contact 5 days ago with a child that had been diagnosed with scarlet fever a few months back and he did not come to school again on friday. i'm just wondering if i'm on the right path with what i might have.

use sun protection every day all year round protect against excess sun exposure and exfoliate on a regular -- but not daily -- basis. look for gentle products that do not strip away the outer layers just gently remove the excess dead skin cells ready to slough off. the outer layers of skin cells are called the stratum corneum and studies show that this layer helps protect against sun damage and against excess water loss from the skin. when it is an even smooth layer the skin looks more radiant and younger. retinoids emollients and gentle exfoliants help achieve this goal.	what is the best routine to prevent aging?

it would not be wise to self-diagnose yourself as having a secondary bacterial infection from your recent viral illness and self-prescribed ampicillin. it would be advisable for you to be properly examined and diagnosed first by a medical professional. ampicillin is not used very much any more so it is unlikely that even if you did have a bacterial infection this would not be the antibiotic of choice. signs of secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia as a result of a respiratory virus would be a high fever a worsening cough with expectoration of dark phlegm chest discomfort rapid respiration and lethargy. a mild sore throat or runny nose does not necessarily indicate a need for ampicillin.	how can i know if my cold/flu has become bacterial? so i can take a ampicillin? . i am aware that ampicillin does nothing if my cold/flu is a virus but i have been sick for a week now and although my body isn't sore/weak anymore i still cough up alot of mucus and coughing hurts my chest a bit and i have a sore throat also runny nose with alot of mucus as well.

hi your find that 126/65 is on the lower side of hbp found you this from avogel. co. uk high blood pressure may be a symptom of the menopause. however there is also debate as to whether hrt raises blood pressure. either way if you are or suspect you are suffering from high blood pressure it is worth speaking to your doctor to get to the root of the problem. your blood pressure is the force that your blood exerts on the walls of your arteries. high blood pressure rarely has obvious symptoms and therefore many people are unaware that they are suffering from it. however it is important to keep a check on your blood pressure level because it can develop into serious health conditions such as heart attacks or strokes. so have you been through the menopause yet? if not it could be your answer see your doctor a blood test will tell all form how your hormones are doing. hope this is it. good luck	iam a 54 year old female and never had high blood pressure is 126/65 an acceptable range?

i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds rather mysterious. i would suggest you see your primary care provider for an evaluation. since you have not experienced any trauma to the area there is no reason it should be bruised. that said many people do experience mild trauma they subsequently forget about. if you take over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or aspirin and then bump yourself you could very well get a mild bruise. at any rate the only way to determine why you are experiencing pain and bruising in your upper back is by examination. your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and might send you for imaging tests (like x-ray or mri ). on rare occasion something concerning like a major illness can cause the symptoms you describe. that's another good reason to see a doctor. it's unlikely you are experiencing anything serious but it's safer to rule out those possibilities. wishing you well!	what could be causing upper back/spine pain? why do i have bruises? . i'm 18 yrs old and for a week i've been having upper back/spine pain. it hurts to be laying on my back or even sitting on the couch and leaning against cushions. i can't prop myself up against pillows because that'll hurt my back. i only feel better by laying on my sides or sitting while leaning forward. i noticed today that i have 2 bruises near the area that is hurting. i don't know why because i never did anything that would've caused this pain/bruising. any ideas what this could be? thanks.

both carbamazepine and flunarizine have side effect of memory loss. you should take tablet vasograin. it is most effective at the onset of migraine. once migraine starts though it reduces some symptoms but not so effectively. so along with it take tablet diclomol (combination of diclofenac and paracetamol) twice a day for three days. it is very effective to control migraine. if headache is very severe you can also take injection voveran intramuscularly. you also need to take tablet razo (rabeprazole) 20 mg twice a day to prevent acidity. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I am 26 years old. I am suffering from migraine for the last 15 years. There is a throbbing pain on one corner of the head and generally the next day it almost definitely shifts to the other corner. This cycle continues. So, the frequency is around 2 headaches per week. I used to take Paracetamol  and Aspirin though the medicines were not very effective. If the medicines are taken within the first half an hour of the beginning of pain, it gives reasonably good results. Two years back, my family doctor prescribed Sibelium 10 mg to be taken once every night. It gave me good results for a while but it increased my hours of sleep and resulted in weight gain and then the migraine attacks also started. My doctor prescribed Zen 200 mg to be taken every morning over and above Sibelium 10 mg in the night. This gave me very good results. Migraine attacks almost stopped. I stopped taking Sibelium and Zen 200 mg was enough to control migraine unless I am travelling by car for over 3 hours. My doctor told that the clinical dose of Carbamazepine is 1600 mg per day and 200 mg is negligible. I gradually reduced the dose to 100 mg per day and then 100 mg twice or thrice a week. Later, though Carbamazepine is not considered as a pain abortive medicine, it worked for me. I used to take 100 mg tablet whenever required. For the last 6 months, I am feeling that I am suffering from memory loss. I used to have a very sharp memory. But, nowadays I forget names. Though, I do not forget events that much but my memory power of remembering names has become miserable. I even forget the name of a person I meet a week or a month ago. I have stopped taking Carbamazepine since June and I am taking Sibelium 10 mg whenever required, approximately twice a week, with good results. But, my memory especially in remembering names has become dull. Please advice.

methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa is an increasingly common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections. mrsa has become a common bacterium causing skin infections in people that seek medical attention. most skin and soft tissue infections begin with redness irritation warmth and swelling of the infected area. because community-acquired mrsa is a virulent (aggressive) bacterium the infection may develop quickly and create a painful red swollen bump on the skin. this may be called a furuncle a boil or an abscess. itching is not one of the main features of mrsa infection. most skin itching is due to dermatitis -- skin that’s inflamed by non-infectious causes. allergies dry skin eczema or chemical irritation are some of the most common causes of skin itching due to dermatitis. dermatitis tends to be mild and come and go while often a true mrsa skin infection tends to get steadily worse without treatment. that’s not to say that an mrsa infection can never itch. for example skin that’s already irritated and itchy (as from a dermatitis) is more vulnerable to infection by mrsa or another bacterium. an mrsa skin infection by itself might be itchy at first but it would be expected to become tender or painful as the infection progressed.	does mrsa itch?

there tons of studies about diabetes and how it effects the brain but first and i am probably preaching to the choir here but lets see your son start taking care of himself. i can understand that he might also be despondent and might even be depressed about his diabetes but there are lots of ways to live happily with it. back to the question at hand i read that diabetes if in check and maintain does not have any adverse affects to the brain but if out of check and when glocuse levels are high for an extended period of time some research shows that it could lead to memory lost brain shrinkage increase stroke probaility and we will be more prone to cognitive decline alzheimer's; but even high sugar levels in non-diabetes can cause these issues but because we diabetics have a hard time controlling blood sugar it is more critical for us.	effect of diabetes on the brain? . my son has been a type 1 diabetic for 40 years has not always taken good care of himself has had numerous occasions that he went into diabetic comma over the years. has there been any study on how this diabetic reations effect the brain?

i'm not sure from your question if you've been diagnosed with gallbladder disease or if you're self-diagnosing. it's important to know. gallstones can be very painful. if stones accumulate or block the bile duct surgery must be performed to remove the gallbladder. it is possible to live a long happy life without your gallbladder. if you only suspect your pain is due to problems with your gallbladder you should get a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of the pain. many conditions can mimic the pain of gallstones so it's important to get an accurate diagnosis. if your skin begins to turn yellowish you should seek emergency medical treatment as this can be a sign of a bile duct blockage. i'm sorry you're experiencing pain in your abdomen. that's never fun. wishing you well!	how do l deal with pain from gall bladder infection or gallstones
the prognosis of viral hepatitis for most patients is good. symptoms of viral hepatitis such as fatigue poor appetite nausea and jaundice usually subside in several weeks to months without any specific treatment. in fact virtually all patients with acute infection with hepatitis a and most adults (greater than 95%) with acute hepatitis b recover completely. complete recovery from viral hepatitis means the hepatitis virus has been completely eliminated from the liver by the body's immune system. the inflammation in the liver subsides. the patient develops immunity to future infection with the same virus. the patient cannot transmit the infection to others. unfortunately not all patients with viral hepatitis infections recover completely. five percent of patients with acute hepatitis b infection and 80% of patients with acute hepatitis c infection develop chronic hepatitis. acute viral hepatitis needs no specific treatment. patients who develop chronic infection have chronic viral hepatitis and often need treatment to prevent further liver damage.	what is the prognosis of viral hepatitis?

"the prostate is a gland located below the bladder of men. it surrounds the urethra (you-reeth-rah) which is a tube that drains urine from the bladder. bph is an enlargement of the prostate gland. the symptoms of bph however can be caused by an increase in the tightness of muscles in the prostate. if the muscles inside the prostate tighten they can squeeze the urethra and slow the flow of urine. this can lead to symptoms such as: a weak or interrupted stream when urinating. a feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely. a feeling of delay when you start to urinate. a need to urinate often especially at night or a feeling that you must urinate right away. treatment options for bph there are three main treatment options for bph: program of monitoring or ""watchful waiting.

tsh is thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. tsh stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormone into the blood. thyroid hormone maintains normal metabolism growth body temperature and many other essential bodily functions. blood levels of tsh and thyroid hormone are maintained in a tight balance. high levels of thyroid hormone cause the pituitary to reduce the release of tsh. low levels of tsh lead the pituitary to release more tsh. this in turn stimulates the thyroid gland which produces more thyroid hormone which reduces the tsh level. this relationship is called a negative feedback loop. doctors use the blood tsh level as a screening blood test for thyroid function: high tsh usually means an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). low tsh is usually due to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). in people being treated for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism tsh also provides information on the success of treatment.	what is tsh?

i do not know know why uti are so common in pd but do not believe it is from the pd or the medications. i believe it is from a tendency to dehydration. with declining mobility fluid tends to pool in the legs during the day and at night when the fluid shifts higher in the body to the body it is more easily filtered by the kidneys. so -- you quit drinking enough fluid to keep from being up all the time. this leads decreased frequency of urination. urination will clear small amounts of bacteria and without that infection is more likely. hallucinations occur from a number of causes - uti being one of them. also medications can cause this problem. i try to reduce medications in the order of most likely to least likely. my criteria are potential for side effects vs. potential for motor benefit -- and it is not an exact science: 1) artane or cogentin. 2) amantadine. 3) selegiline. 4) rasagiline. 5) pramipexole or ropinirole. 6) entacapone. 7) levodopa. i would not want to stop levodopa and would likely start a medicine for hallucinations before that. the two most commonly suggested in the us are quetiapine or clozapine.	why are septicemia and urinary tract infections so prevalent with parkinson's? and do the meds cause hallucinations?
caffeine can increase the blood pressure but the effect usually only lasts for a short time. experts have yet to make a strong link between caffeine and long term high blood pressure. that being said a lot of doctors tell patients that have high blood pressure or heart disease that they should limit their caffeine. a boost even a temporary one in blood pressure may not be a good idea on top of already high blood pressure. besides coffee caffeine is found in tea energy drinks soft drinks and even in chocolate. some headache/pain medicines also have caffeine in them. your daughter-in-law should let her doctor know how much coffee she drinks as well as other sources of caffeine in her day. too much caffeine is often a cause of sleep problems or can make existing sleep problems even worse. hope this helps!	is there a relationship between excessice coffee drinking and high blood pressure? . my daughter-in-law makes 5-6 pots of coffee daily. she has high blood pressure and gets headaches. is she drinking too much coffee that would cause the elevation in blood pressure? she also takes a lot of prescription pain medicine and a sleep medication.

osteoarthritis (ah-stee-oh-ar-threye-tis) is the most common type of arthritis and is seen especially among older people. sometimes it is called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthrosis. osteoarthritis mostly affects cartilage (kar-til-uj) the hard but slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they meet to form a joint. healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another. it also absorbs energy from the shock of physical movement. in osteoarthritis the surface layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. this allows bones under the cartilage to rub together causing pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. over time the joint may lose its normal shape. also small deposits of bone – called osteophytes or bone spurs – may grow on the edges of the joint. bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space. this causes more pain and damage. people with osteoarthritis usually have joint pain and some movement limitations. unlike some other forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis affects only joint function and does not affect skin tissue the lungs the eyes or the blood vessels. in rheumatoid arthritis the second most common form of arthritis the immune system attacks the tissues of the joints leading to pain inflammation and eventually joint damage and malformation. it typically begins at a younger age than osteoarthritis causes swelling and redness in joints and may make people feel sick tired and uncommonly feverish.	what is osteoarthritis?
if you have symptoms of hypothyroidism your doctor will order blood tests to check hormone levels. these may include: thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) t4 (thyroxine) lower-than-normal t4 levels usually mean you have hypothyroidism. however some people may have increased tsh levels while having normal t4 levels. this is called subclinical (mild) hypothyroidism. it is believed to be an early stage of hypothyroidism. if your test results or physical exam of the thyroid are abnormal your doctor may order a thyroid ultrasound or thyroid scan to check for nodules or inflammation.	how is hypothyroidism diagnosed?

no urinary tract infections are not contagious. a person with a bacterial infection in their urinary tract could indeed transfer these bacteria to a vagina during sexual intercourse but it would be highly unlikely for the exposed person to get a urinary tract infection for this alone. with that said you can develop a urinary tract infection on your own from sexual activity. as a matter of fact this is listed as one of the most common causes. in most cases it your own bacteria -- bacteria from your colon and rectal area -- that become contaminated or colonized in your vaginal area that gets transferred into your urethra/bladder during sexual activity.	are urinary tract infections contagious. my boyfriend has a kidney stone and had a lithotripsy done to break it up. they inserted a stent and it has been there for a few months. during which we had sex and he was given an rx for a u. t. i. but didn't take it. i want to see if he does have a u. t. i. could it be contagious or can it cause any other complications for me?

if you had an ectopic pregnancy then it would show on the sonogram. pregnancy test could be positive due to leftover tissue. as it was removed it should be examined by histopathology test. sometimes hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) producing trophoblastic tissue (it is similar to a healthy pregnancy tissue) persists inside uterus giving positive pregnancy tests. if your test comes positive then you should do titer of serum beta-hcg every third day to see if it is rising or falling. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>	Hi doctor,I had an early aspiration abortion two months back. They found two sacks and that were removed. Last week, I felt weird and took a pregnancy test. The test came back positive. I went into the doctor's office, and they did an ultrasound.

i have no way of determining how long your tinnitus (ringing) might last. acoustic damage to the ear from concerts can be severe but unfortunately i have no way of determining the decibel level you experienced or know if you permanently damaged your ears. my guess would be that you will be fine in a week or so like your doctor mentioned but again that is just a guess. you have learned a very valuable lesson about acoustic injury. we live in a world of protective devices. children wear helmets when they ride a bike. football players not only wear high-tech helmets but an array of modern day armor. people wear safety glasses to protect their eyes when woodworking or playing racket ball. who is protecting our ears and precious hearing? it has been estimated that more than 30 million americans are exposed to dangerous sound levels on a regular basis and an estimated 10 million already have hearing loss from the noise.

benign brain tumors are noncancerous. malignant primary brain tumors are cancers that originate in the brain. they typically grow faster than benign tumors and aggressively invade surrounding tissue. although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs it will spread to other parts of the brain and central nervous system. benign brain tumors usually have clearly defined borders and usually are not deeply rooted in brain tissue. this makes them easier to surgically remove assuming they are in an area of the brain that can be safely operated on. but even after they've been removed they can still come back though benign tumors are less likely than malignant ones to recur. although benign tumors in other parts of the body can cause problems they are not generally considered to be a major health problem or to be life threatening. but even a benign brain tumor can be a serious health problem. brain tumors damage the cells around them by causing inflammation and putting increased pressure on the tissue under and around it as well as inside the skull.	what's the difference between benign and malignant brain tumors?

"when a person stands up from sitting or lying down the body must work to adjust to that change in position. it is especially important for the body to push blood upward and supply the brain with oxygen. if the body fails to do this adequately blood pressure falls and a person may feel lightheaded or even pass out. orthostatic hypotension is the term used to describe the fall in blood pressure when a person stands (orthostatic= upright posture of the body; hypo= less + tension=pressure). adequate blood supply to the body's organs depends upon three factors: a heart strong enough to pump. arteries and veins that are able to constrict or squeeze. enough blood and fluid within the vessels. when the body changes position a variety of actions occur involving all parts of the cardiovascular system as well as the autonomic nervous system that helps regulate their function. the autonomic nervous system can be considered to ""run in the background"" of the body regulating body processes that we take for granted. there is a balance between the sympathetic system (adrenergic nerves) that speed things up and the parasympathetic system (cholinergic nerves) that slow things down. these names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. adrenaline (from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to stress. imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster your palms get sweaty your eyes dilate and your hair stands on end. acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system. these two systems are in balance and yet need to respond to routine changes in the body that happens throughout the day. when the body moves to a standing position pressure monitors (baroreceptor cells) located in the carotid arteries and the aorta sense a subtle drop in blood pressure because of gravity which causes blood to flow towards the legs. almost immediately the sympathetic system is stimulated causing the heart rate to increase the heart muscle to contract or squeeze more forcefully and blood vessels to constrict or narrow. all of these actions serve to increase the blood pressure so that an adequate amount of blood can still be pumped to the brain and other organs. without these changes gravity would cause the blood to remain in the lowest part of the body and away from the brain causing symptoms of lightheadedness or even passing out. orthostatic hypotension is not a disease or a complaint from an individual; it is an abnormal change in blood pressure and heart rate associated with an illness."	what is orthostatic hypotension?

"uncomplicated high blood pressure usually occurs without any symptoms (silently) and so hypertension has been labeled ""the silent killer. "" it is called this because the disease can progress to finally develop any one or more of the several potentially fatal complications of hypertension such as heart attacks or strokes. uncomplicated hypertension may be present and remain unnoticed for many years or even decades. this happens when there are no symptoms and those affected fail to undergo periodic blood pressure screening. some people with uncomplicated hypertension however may experience symptoms such as headache dizziness shortness of breath and blurred vision. the presence of symptoms can be a good thing in that they can prompt people to consult a doctor for treatment and make them more compliant in taking their medications. often however a person's first contact with a physician may be after significant damage to the end-organs has occurred. in many cases a person visits or is brought to the doctor or an emergency room with a heart attack stroke kidney failure or impaired vision (due to damage to the back part of the retina). greater public awareness and frequent blood pressure screening may help to identify patients with undiagnosed high blood pressure before significant complications have developed. about one out of every 100 (1%) people with hypertension is diagnosed with severe high blood pressure (accelerated or malignant hypertension) at their first visit to the doctor. in these patients the diastolic blood pressure (the minimum pressure) exceeds 140 mm hg! affected persons often experience severe headache nausea visual symptoms dizziness and sometimes kidney failure. malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and requires urgent treatment to prevent a stroke (brain damage)."	what are the symptoms of high blood pressure?

"some common causes of hyperthyroidism include: graves' disease. functioning adenoma (""hot nodule"") and toxic multinodular goiter (tmng). excessive intake of thyroid hormones. abnormal secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland). excessive iodine intake. graves' disease graves' disease which is caused by a generalized overactivity of the thyroid gland is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. in this condition the thyroid gland usually is renegade which means it has lost the ability to respond to the normal control by the pituitary gland via tsh. graves' disease is hereditary and is up to five times more common among women than men. graves' disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease and antibodies that are characteristic of the illness may be found in the blood. these antibodies include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (tsi antibodies) thyroid peroxidase antibodies (tpo) and tsh receptor antibodies. graves' disease can be diagnosed by a standard nuclear medicine thyroid scan which shows diffusely increased uptake of a radioactively-labeled iodine. in addition a blood test may reveal elevated tsi levels. functioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter the thyroid gland (like many other areas of the body) becomes lumpier as we get older. in the majority of cases these lumps do not produce thyroid hormones and require no treatment. occasionally a nodule may become ""autonomous "" which means that it does not respond to pituitary regulation via tsh and produces thyroid hormones independently. this becomes more likely if the nodule is larger than 3 cm. when there is a single nodule that is independently producing thyroid hormones it is called a functioning nodule. if there is more than one functioning nodule the term toxic multinodular goiter is used. functioning nodules may be readily detected with a thyroid scan. excessive intake of thyroid hormones taking too much thyroid hormone medication is actually quite common. excessive doses of thyroid hormones frequently go undetected due to the lack of follow-up of patients taking their thyroid medicine. other persons may be abusing the drug in an attempt to achieve other goals such as weight loss. these patients can be identified by having a low uptake of radioactively-labelled iodine (radio-iodine) on a thyroid scan. abnormal secretion of tsh a tumor in the pituitary gland may produce an abnormally high secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). this leads to excessive signaling to the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. this condition is very rare and can be associated with other abnormalities of the pituitary gland. to identify this disorder an endocrinologist performs elaborate tests to assess the release of tsh. thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) inflammation of the thyroid gland may occur after a viral illness (subacute thyroiditis). this condition is associated with a fever and a sore throat that is often painful on swallowing. the thyroid gland is also tender to the touch. there may be generalized neck aches and pains. inflammation of the gland with an accumulation of white blood cells known as lymphocytes (lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also occur. thyroiditis can be diagnosed by a thyroid scan. excessive iodine intake the thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. an excess of iodine may cause hyperthyroidism. iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually seen in patients who already have an underlying abnormal thyroid gland. certain medications such as amiodarone (cordarone) which is used in the treatment of heart problems contain a large amount of iodine and may be associated with thyroid function abnormalities."	what causes hyperthyroidism?
if you get a persistent or painful erection which is called priapism you need to be seen right away. believe it or not it’s common enough that everyone in the er will have seen it they’ll get you in. the doctors will first try to ice you up hoping that they can chill it. sometimes you can even squeeze the blood out and the erection will fade and that’s actually a good sign though it can be horribly painful. there are these phaso-dilators medications that will allow the blood vessels to expand to allow the blood to leave they can have you inhale those and sometimes that works. if that doesn’t work and the other techniques don’t work then usually the urologist will have to go in and actually extract the old thick blood causing the erection to go away and sometimes put in some fresh fluids to try to get the old sludging fluid to leave. we numb up the skin put in a needle and basically aspirate out pull out the old thick blood that’s no longer oxygenated it’s just static and getting old. and that allows the erection to fade and usually in a very short time men have resolution of the pain. the great thing about it is the sooner you act the better your chance for a normal sex life in the future. if you wait and i’ve seen some men that wait for 24 hours then your risk for complications permanent scarring permanent damage go way up.	what treatment can i expect at the er for my painful erection?

most helpful answer viral pharyngitis is just a sore throat caused by a cold (respiratory) virus. biologically respiratory viruses are contagious a day before you know you are sick and then for about two days later (estimate). exposing others would not likely cause them to have identical symptoms but they could get a cold. since cold viruses are everywhere she can really go back to her usual activities (school church choir) when she is feeling better. colds last about a week but most people feel fine by day four. resting the voice when she has a sore throat is usually a good idea so use your own judgment.	is my daughter's viral pharyngitis contagious? . asking this for my daughter. i don't want her to get anyone in our family sick. especially if my daughter has to go to school she is also in choir should i write a note to her teacher letting her know if she has to rest her voice? should i keep her home?

the small intestine has an inner lining of cells that form finger-like projections called villi. the villi are important because they increase the number of cells and surface area available for the absorption of nutrients from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream. in celiac disease inflammation destroys the villi causing the inner lining of the small intestine to become flattened. this loss of villi reduces the cells and surface area available for absorption of nutrients. the impaired absorption of nutrients is referred to as malabsorption. the malabsorption of nutrients leads to nutrient deficiencies referred to as malnutrition. the length (amount) of the small intestine affected by the loss of villi varies from patient to patient and the length that is involved determines the severity of signs and symptoms. thus patients whose entire small intestine is affected by a loss of villi have more severe signs and symptoms of malabsorption than patients who have only part of the small intestine affected. when only part of the small intestine is affected it usually is the upper small intestine (the duodenum and jejunum) that is more affected than the lower small intestine (the ileum).	what does celiac disease do to the small intestine?
the surgical correction of a buried penis depends on the abnormality. however marked improvement can be achieved in almost all patients. the correction is based on re-establishing the connection of the erectile chambers of the penis to the penile skin along with the removal of excess pubic fat and/or skin. in severe cases of buried penis in which the patient has inadequate penis skin resulting from an overly aggressive circumcision or chronic inflammation then the penis must be freed and covered with a skin graft. the surgery is usually performed as an outpatient unless a skin graft is needed. the improvement in penile and pubic appearance can be dramatic. equally impressive is the patient’s positive personality and self-esteem improvement leading to more self-confidence and social interaction.	can surgery correct hidden or buried penis?

although most people with epilepsy lead full active lives they are at special risk for two life-threatening conditions: status epilepticus and sudden unexplained death. status epilepticus status epilepticus is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a person either has an abnormally prolonged seizure or does not fully regain consciousness between seizures. although there is no strict definition for the time at which a seizure turns into status epilepticus most people agree that any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes should for practical purposes be treated as though it was status epilepticus. status epilepticus affects about 195 000 people each year in the united states and results in about 42 000 deaths. while people with epilepsy are at an increased risk for status epilepticus about 60 percent of people who develop this condition have no previous seizure history. these cases often result from tumors trauma or other problems that affect the brain and may themselves be life-threatening. while most seizures do not require emergency medical treatment someone with a prolonged seizure lasting more than 5 minutes may be in status epilepticus and should be taken to an emergency room immediately. it is important to treat a person with status epilepticus as soon as possible. one study showed that 80 percent of people in status epilepticus who received medication within 30 minutes of seizure onset eventually stopped having seizures whereas only 40 percent recovered if 2 hours had passed before they received medication. doctors in a hospital setting can treat status epilepticus with several different drugs and can undertake emergency life-saving measures such as administering oxygen if necessary. people in status epilepticus do not always have severe convulsive seizures. instead they may have repeated or prolonged nonconvulsive seizures. this type of status epilepticus may appear as a sustained episode of confusion or agitation in someone who does not ordinarily have that kind of mental impairment. while this type of episode may not seem as severe as convulsive status epilepticus it should still be treated as an emergency. sudden unexplained death for reasons that are poorly understood people with epilepsy have an increased risk of dying suddenly for no discernible reason. this condition called sudden unexplained death can occur in people without epilepsy but epilepsy increases the risk about two-fold. researchers are still unsure why sudden unexplained death occurs. one study suggested that use of more than two anticonvulsant drugs may be a risk factor. however it is not clear whether the use of multiple drugs causes the sudden death or whether people	are there special risks associated with epilepsy?
an ear infection is usually limited to the ear. you may have a runny nose & nasal congestion with it but it should go away within 10 days. if it is viral antibiotics are not needed; if it is bacterial antibiotics will help. since you have additional symptoms and it has been going on for 2 weeks it is important you see a doctor. flushing and chest tightness is not a part of an ear infection so see your doctor so she can examine you to find out why this is happening.	can a ear infection cause my face to start flushing? . after getting over a coldish sinus thing my face started flushing. it happens while im just sitting at my desk not doing much. it happens everyday and can last a few minutes or sometimes for like a hour. this has been going on for about 2 weeks now and now im back to having some sort of sinus thing. i dont have any nasal congestion but i has sinus pressure post nasal drip and now my chest feels tight like its also congested.

the short answer is: everyone should know his/her hiv status. you may have known your status prior to this episode of unprotected anal sex but now your status may have changed. it would be in your best interest to get tested again. because it takes anywhere from six weeks to several months for the body to begin producing hiv antibodies (which is what the hiv test is designed to detect) you may need to be tested several times over the next 12 months to be sure you didn't pick up the virus from your sex partner. i'd also suggest you have a conversation with your health care provider about whether or not you should take more aggressive measures than repeated screenings. he or she is in the best position to advise you. above all else please practice safe sex by using a condom. unprotected anal sex isn't a wise idea but remember it's also possible to transmit hiv through vaginal sex. anyone who is sexually active should take responsibility for the safety of him/herself and his/her partner. hope this helps!	if i had unprotected anal sex with someone i did not know but they said they were clean should i consider taking hiv pep. it was 2-3 hours ago

deciding to exercise while you’re sick can depend a lot on your illness and your symptoms. to be honest the answer to your question often depends on who you’re asking since there really doesn’t seem to be a clear consensus or agreement. i personally feel more often than not that it’s best to take time to rest and recover from your illness before continuing with exercise. my rationale comes from a physiological standpoint. basically exercise can put a lot of stress on your body and your immune system is the only way that your body fights infections and pathogens that make you sick. when you exercise you’re devoting some of your body’s resources towards recovery from exercise instead of recovery from illness. in some instances exercise may even make you sicker or even prolong your illness. you also have to consider how comfortable you would feel while exercising with some of your various symptoms. medication may help alleviate some symptoms but otherwise how would you feel trying to go for a run if you’re congested or have a persistent cough? if you choose to exercise while sick you should consider decreasing your exercise intensity frequency or duration until you fully recover. please be considerate by following proper gym etiquette if you choose to work out in a gym. check out this webmd article for more input and guidance: <link>. i have the same symptoms. i feel its closer to the bronchitis side of things because of the clear mucus i cough when i am not riding. i am able to comfortably take my heart rate over 160 but i still have a cough which lasts for weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection (generally also involving the sinuses. i also get the odd drainage from my sinuses after/during a hot shower for example which seems to clear them. my explanation is as follows: when i am riding outdoors in the summer i breath a lot of pollens (i am not in the city) a little exhaust and this will tend to exacerbate an existing irritation. corticosteroids have limited effect to reduce the irritation but can reduce an acute irritation to the point where it is no longer chronic and my body's defenses can make a difference. thus its a combination of factors which typically plays out in the following order 1. bad cold/urt infection (5 days) 2. chronic cough (1 week to 8 weeks) but lungs good enough to exercise. 3. clear 2-8 months managing the level 2 is what this is all about. on occasions where i have been at the coast swimming in the sea often clears things up much faster. (which supports the sinus/allergen/irritant theory).	should i continue exercise if i have a cold or bronchitis? . i developed sinus pressure and chest congestion. i continued my running. when my symptoms didn't improve after 3 weeks i went to a doctor who gave me a steroid and an antibiotic but said it was okay to keep running. i recovered mostly though i still felt the symptoms a little. last night i developed a dry cough which feels again to be in my chest and i have a little sinus pressure again. my exercise helps me mentally but is it the cause of my prolonged problem?

surgery is rarely used to treat tuberculosis (tb). but it may be used to treat extensively drug-resistant tb (xdr-tb) or to treat complications of an infection in the lungs or another part of the body. surgery is used to: repair lung damage such as serious bleeding that cannot be stopped any other way or repeated lung infections other than tb. remove a pocket of bacteria that cannot be killed with long-term medicine treatment. surgery has a high success rate but it also has a risk of complications which may include infections other than tb and shortness of breath after surgery. surgery for tb outside the lungs surgery sometimes may be needed to remove or repair organs damaged by tb in parts of the body other than the lungs ( extrapulmonary tb ) or to prevent other rare complications such as: tb infection of the brain (tb meningitis ). your doctor may surgically place a tube (shunt) that drains excess fluid from the brain to prevent a buildup of pressure that can further damage the brain. tb infections of the heart (tb pericarditis ). your surgeon may partially remove or repair the infected sac around the heart. tb infection of the kidneys (renal tb). your surgeon may need to either remove your infected kidney or repair the kidney or other parts of the urinary system. tb infection of the joints. you may need surgery to repair damaged areas of your spine or joints (orthopedic surgery). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for tuberculosis tb?

we know aspirin interferes with blood clotting so people go off aspirin for some period of time. but often patients don’t know that some of the other medications they are taking without a prescription again or even with prescription may interfere. so we have a list of over 200 medications over the counter and prescription that are known to contain elements that would interfere with blood clotting and we give it to the patient well in advance of the surgery and say look through this list and if you’re taking any of these please stop or let’s talk about. and we ask very specifically on our questionnaires what medicines are you taking both prescription medications and non-prescription medications. we are trying to make sure the patient doesn’t forget or doesn’t disregard the importance of these medications that could interfere by the way not only with the bleeding but even with the anesthesia. there are certain drugs that the anesthesiologist would be very unhappy if he didn’t know the patient were taking. but it’s not just supplements and prescriptions. what about foods? well garlic and ginger for example when consumed in large amounts can cause some change in clotting yeah so we tell people about it. we tell people those things that would get them into trouble. by the way foods can also help us though because papaya and pineapple rich in an enzyme called papase which is the same thing that is in meat tenderizer after surgery very good because they help digest the red cells that cause bruising. when you see a bruise it’s because the red cells in the blood have seeped into the tissues and it helps digest them. so you know foods can work for us and they can also work against us. but we need to know. this is the most important thing. and this is why it’s so important to have a very complete evaluation by the cosmetic surgeon a very complete evaluation by your personal doctor so that none of these things would slip through the cracks. we don’t want anything slipping through the cracks. an anesthesiologist’s worst nightmare is that the patient took a drug that the anesthesiologist didn’t know about and that drug was in the patient’s system and could interfere sometimes significantly with a safe anesthetic.	what medications and foods should i avoid before surgery?
it's difficult to predict the rate of progression of emphysema symptoms. much is unknown about why emphysema occurs and in whom. in some people emphysema symptoms progress faster than in others. it's believed that genetic factors make some people more vulnerable to developing emphysema. genetics may also cause some people's emphysema symptoms to progress more rapidly. the majority of people with emphysema though can expect relatively slow progression of emphysema symptoms provided they quit smoking.	how does emphysema progress?
"that's very interesting because vicodin (generic name is hydrocodone with acetaminophen) contains a narcotic that normally causes drowsiness. when a person reacts to a medication in the opposite way as expected it's called a ""paradoxical effect. "" some sleeping pills are well known for having a paradoxical effect on people keeping them wide awake all night long. in general experiencing a paradoxical effect from medication is nothing to be concerned about. it's not an allergy or anything like that. it just indicates your body responds differently to that particular medication. even if the hydrocodone controlled your pain you don't want to take a medication that causes you insomnia. you might consider scratching hydrocodone off your list and requesting a different prescription pain reliever the next time you need one. just let the doctor know how hydrocodone affects you. there are plenty of other narcotic pain relievers to choose from. wishing you well!"	i took vicodin for the first time post operatively for pain and it kept me awake at night. what is this called and why?

these innocent little red areas are called subconjunctival hemorrhages. they are just tiny little bruises from ruptured blood vessels. they appear bright red in the eye because the conjunctiva is crystal clear and easy to see. if these hemorrhage occurred on your skin they will be just a tiny bruise and go unnoticed. blood vessels can rupture for many reasons but the most common cause of these would be straining. straining to lift something straining at work or even straining to have a bowel movement. i saw a new mother a few days ago and both her eyes were bright red from hemorrhages. she had quite a strain delivering a 10 pound baby a few days prior! people who take aspirin or other blood-thinning medications tend to have more of these conjunctival hemorrhages. if you are bruising in other areas not just your eyes it would be wise to consult your medical provider.	i frequenly get blood vesels breaking in my eye causing white area to be bright red what is the cause? . it starts with what looks like a pin hole gets worse and can last over a week.

hi if its a vaginal hysterectomy this is an operation to remove a woman's uterus (womb) and cervix. the operation is carried out through the vagina - no cut is made on the abdomen. the top of the vagina is closed. rarely the ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed at the same time – this operation is called a salpingo-oophorectomy. the only thing i can find about being overweight is this. women who are overweight for example take longer to recover. when discussing the pros and cons of hysterectomy with your gynaecologist you should take into account possible problems including side effects and complications. do hope this helps you. good luck	is an overweight woman good candidate for partial hysterectomy. bleeding has been going on and off for years and i just had an endomertrial biopsy but don't know the results but i have been told that a hysterectomy partial would be good for me but then someone else said no i do not want to keep livening with this bleeding issue please help me

absolutely. to the schizophrenic the things they are hearing/seeing are absolutely real. if you hear someone call your name you're going to turn around and see who it was right? because you know in your mind you heard a real person call your name. it's the same with schizophrenia. the voices and people they see in their hallucinations are absolutely 100% real and it's a very bad idea to try and convince him/her otherwise.	are there situations where a schizophrenic can not differeniate between visual hallucinations and reality?

when a joint is swollen sometimes joint fluid is removed before cortisone is injected. if fluid is removed it can be analyzed to determine what caused the joint to swell. this is a big advantage as it is a powerful and accurate diagnostic test. a distinct benefit of a corticosteroid injection is that the relief of localized inflammation in a particular body area is more rapid and powerful than with traditional anti-inflammatory medications given by mouth such as aspirin. a single injection also can avoid certain side effects notably irritation of the stomach that can accompany many oral anti-inflammatory medications. cortisone injections can be administered easily in the doctor's office. other advantages include the rapid onset of the medication's action dependability and minimal side effects.	what are the advantages of cortisone injections?

most helpful answer you can get an infection from any scratch. a dog a stick a fingernail etc. a dog is really no more risky than any of those things. basically anything that breaks the protective integrity of your skin has the potential of causing a secondary infection. you have done the proper thing by immediately washing the wound using an antiseptic and a topical antibiotic. changes are good that you will not get an infection but if you see progressive redness swelling or pain at the scratch site this could be a sign that the wound is becoming infected.	can you get an infection from a superfical dog scratch? . the scratch didn't bleed and it was cleaned with hydrogen peroxide and applied neosporin after.
please keep one thing in mind. you did not gain the weight over a few months so don't expect it to magically fall off in a few months; there are no shortcuts just dedication and the will power you will need to get your butt off the couch and head outside (or treadmill) and walk everyday. at first just do what you can but make a training schedule and follow it - you are accountable to no one but yourself so don't let yourself down! i will not do you any favors by lying to you or telling you loosing weight is easy. as you know it is not. it is a long hard journey to loose the weight but if your mindset is right and your willpower is strong (do it for no one but yourself). then you are on your way to a successful weight loss journey! good luck! btw. before putting something in your mouth ask yourself if you are really hungry if you are not - ask yourself why you are eating.	im 314lbs and trying to lose weight. i cant excercise 2 min before im gasping for air. how can i get a work out in?

there may be nothing that you or her mother can do. she is 19 years old and definitely emancipated with five babies. while we may all agree that having more babies are not in her best interest there is really no one who could legally force her to get sterilized or to use birth control. she can be counseled about birth control -- suggesting a good reliable contraception that she does not have to think about -- such as an iud or implant but in the end the choice is still left up to her.	what to do with 19 year old that just wants to have babies? . she is 19 and has 5 babies. her mother wants to get her tubes tied the doctor said yes and is now saying no. she just had premie baby boys about a month aga and is already having sex again. should we seek the advice of another doctor. all her babies are under the age of 4
so sorry to hear you're going through this! how unpleasant. many conditions could cause the symptoms you're describing. anything from food poisoning to the flu could be at work here. if you spike a fever (over 101 degrees) then it's time to seek medical attention. if you don't have a thermometer for taking your temperature i recommend you get one. it's impossible to determine whether or not someone has a fever by simply feeling their forehead or judging by whether they're sweating or things like that. you really need to get a thermometer and measure your temperature accurately. if you're not feverish then you probably can take a wait-and-see attitude. drink plenty of fluids and don't try eating anything while you're actively vomiting or nauseated (sick to your stomach). if the symptoms continue to get worse if you get a fever or if you get sharp pains on the right side of your abdomen then it would be a good idea to see a health care provider. i hope you feel better soon! also i keep rotating between overheating and overcooling. have been keeping my sweater on anyways.	i have sharp pains in the stomach and upper intestine areas nausea throwing up and dizzyness should i be concerned? . it's been five hours and it's only getting worse. it started slightly about the belly button then spread to my sides and up.

prenatal vitamins are very similar to multivitamins. the three elements that are most important for a prenatal vitamin are the amounts of folic acid iron and calcium. typically a prescription prenatal vitamin has more folic acid and/or iron than a nonprescription prenatal vitamin or a traditional multivitamin. it would not be dangerous for your daughter’s husband to take her prenatal vitamins by accident. depending on the product he may have consumed more of some daily vitamins and minerals than is necessary but as a one-time error this should not be harmful.	my daughter’s husband took prescription prenatal vitamins on accident. is this dangerous?

fever in a child (not sure what age) does not cause stunted growth so i am unclear as to the medical justification of the x-ray unless the doctor wanted to get a chest x-ray to rule out a subtle pneumonia. tylenol can be given every 4 hours but ibuprofen is every six hours. fevers are not harmful. they are the body's normal response to fighting off infections (usually viruses) so if a child is over 3 months old medical provider rarely get excited about routine fevers.	can a fever in an infant cause stunted growth? . my month old daughter had a fever of 102. 5 for a week straight. we called our pediatrician everyday and they just advised us to give her motrin/tyleon every 4 hours until it broke. they now are wanting to do x-rays of her to confirm that her growth has not been stunted. i just am not sure why i need to expose her to the radiation when we are able to measure her and compare her numbers to the growth charts.

for common skin warts many dermatologists agree that it’s perfectly fine to try over-the-counter wart treatments for a couple of months. if your warts don’t go away during that time or if they get worse it may be wise to seek medical attention. dermatologists have a variety of wart treatment and removal techniques that are stronger and work faster than commercially available products. also remember that all warts can be “mother” warts that give rise to additional warts in your skin. so the faster you remove the wart the less likely it will spread.	when do you need to see a doctor about warts?
a couple of years have gone by since the center for science in the public interest first filed a complaint against the parent company (coca-cola) that manufactures glaceau vitamin water. and now the washington-based national consumers league has joined in by filing a formal complaint with the federal trade commission calling advertising and labeling claims on vitamin water products “dangerously misleading. ” as if the “names” of the various vitamin water flavors like “revive ” “focus ” or “defense” weren’t misleading enough health claims made in advertising have ranged from “supporting optimal immune function” to “reducing the risk of age-related eye disease. ” hopefully we all know that fortifying sugar water with various vitamins and minerals isn’t really going to keep us from getting sick or reduce the risk of disease. the best thing we can do for most of these health concerns is to eat a healthful diet rich in whole foods and plant foods get plenty of rest and wash our hands frequently. for example vitamin water’s focus drink features “vitamin a and lutein ” according to the label on the bottle. if you want some lutein one of the antioxidant-acting carotenoid phytochemicals that has been mentioned in research lately just eat some dark green leafy veggies green peppers corn avocados oranges tomatoes or parsley! and instead of drinking their defense drink with vitamin c and zinc just eat an orange broccoli (and other dark leafy green veggies) brussels sprouts berries kiwi cantaloupe papaya or mango for the vitamin c and some lean meats crab nuts and whole grains for zinc. here’s what we do know about glaceau vitamin water: each 20-ounce bottle is labeled as containing 2. 5 servings crystalline fructose is the true main ingredient accounting for about 33 grams of sugar if you drink the whole bottle. each 20-ounce bottle totals 125 calories. the bottom line: keep your eyes open when it comes to manufactured products making health claims especially those fortified with nutrients. remember that the best water to drink is still good old h20 — not water pumped with 50 calories worth of sugar per eight-ounce serving.	what should i know about vitamin water?
at first ringworm of the scalp or beard may look like dandruff with flakes of dead skin on the hair or beard. there may be round or oval patches of baldness. the skin under the hair or beard may be itchy red and peeling. the infection can spread gradually and cover a large area. as fungi invade the hair the hair becomes infected brittle and breaks off near the root resulting in patches of baldness. if you treat ringworm early hair loss is usually temporary. the scalp or the skin under the beard may become very tender if swollen areas and bumps that look like blisters or nodules with pus (kerions) develop. skin blisters can become infected. ringworm of the scalp or beard can cause scarring and permanent hair loss. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get ringworm of the scalp or beard?
the post-operative swelling and numbness after mandible fracture surgery are common. the swelling is mild as you have mentioned. then it should resolve in another one to two weeks as the tissues heal. the numbness is because the mental nerve which runs through the mandible is hurt at some point during surgery. it can last from a few days to even three months. in most of the cases the numbness will fade away automatically when the nerve regeneration takes place. you will feel pricking kind of electric shock at times during the day as a sign of nerve healing. but if the numbness lasts for more than three months then it should be given attention. meanwhile i suggest tablet nurokind 500 (mecobalamin) once daily after meals for 30 days which helps in nerve repair. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take medicine with consent. for further information consult a dentist online --><link>	Hi doctor,I was having a bilateral fracture of mandible at angles on both sides and have done the surgery.

patients are most often prescribed drugs known as aminosalicylates commonly called 5-asa preparations which reduce inflammation in the bowel wall and help prevent flare-ups. they work well for mild to moderate disease of the colon. brand names include pentasa asacol colasal and azulfidine. corticosteroids are prescribed to bring the disease into remission. for moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease these medications are given intravenously in the hospital. a new drug called infliximab which blocks one of the chemicals involved in inflammation is also available. it is often recommended as an alternative to corticosteroids which can have serious long-term adverse effects. this drug helps bring the disease under control and maintains the disease in remission. your doctor will discuss the best medication given your symptoms and overall health.	can medications help ulcerative colitis?

"the different types of lupus include: systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is the most common form. the word ""systemic"" means that the disease can involve many parts of the body. sle symptoms can be mild or serious. discoid lupus erythematosus mainly affects the skin. a red rash may appear or the skin on the face scalp or elsewhere may change color. drug-induced lupus is triggered by a few medicines. it's like sle but symptoms are usually milder. most of the time the disease goes away when the medicine is stopped. more men develop drug-induced lupus because the drugs that cause it hydralazine and procainamide are used to treat heart conditions that are more common in men."	are there different types of lupus?

medicines used to treat angina reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen to compensate for the reduced blood supply. three commonly used classes of drugs are the nitrates beta blockers and calcium blockers. nitroglycerin (nitro-bid) is an example of a nitrate. examples of beta blockers include propranolol (inderal) and atenolol (tenormin). examples of calcium blockers include nicardipine (cardene) and nifedipine (procardia adalat). unstable angina is also treated with aspirin and the intravenous blood thinner heparin. aspirin prevents clumping of platelets while heparin prevents blood clotting on the surface of plaques in a critically narrowed artery. when patients continue to have angina despite taking maximum medications or when significant ischemia still occurs with exercise testing they usually need coronary arteriography. during coronary arteriography doctors decide whether the patient should be considered for percutaneous coronary intervention or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (ptca) where a small balloon is used to inflate the blockage. angioplasty (ptca) is usually followed by placement of a stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (cabg) to increase coronary artery blood flow. angioplasty can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients. under x-ray guidance a wire is advanced from the groin to the coronary artery. a small catheter with a balloon at the end is threaded over the wire to reach the narrowed segment. the balloon is then inflated to push the artery open and a steel mesh stent is generally inserted. cabg surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients who have failed medical therapy and are not good candidates for angioplasty (ptca). cabg surgery is ideal for patients with many narrowings in multiple coronary artery branches such as is often seen in patients with diabetes. cabg surgery has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and in patients with significant narrowing of multiple arteries especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function.	how is coronary artery disease treated?
"there are both symptoms and signs of pregnancy. these symptoms and signs depend upon the time in pregnancy. in the first trimester of pregnancy the first sign of pregnancy is most often a missed menstrual period. if a sexually active woman's periods are generally regular missing a period for a week or more is presumptive evidence of pregnancy. early symptoms of pregnancy also include feelings of breast swelling and tenderness and nausea sometimes with vomiting. ""morning sickness"" does not always occur in the morning. many women become fatigued early in pregnancy and some may feel abdominal enlargement (bloating). early in pregnancy the woman may feel she has to urinate frequently especially at nighttime and she may leak urine when coughing sneezing or laughing. this is also normal later in pregnancy and is not a problem. other changes characteristic of pregnancy include the deepening color of the areola (area surrounding the nipple) increased body temperature the mask of pregnancy (darkening of skin on the forehead bridge of the nose or cheekbones) and a dark line going down from the middle of the central abdomen area to the pubic area. eventually enlargement of the abdomen is a normal feature of the growing fetus."	what are pregnancy symptoms?
actually for self-treatment in the field we don't really encourage travelers to touch base with a provider before starting treatment. many travelers will be in areas where providers may not be up to the standard of care that travelers are used to or may be in places where the medications they can obtain are not safe -- there is a big market in counterfeit medications in some developing nations. so we urge people to get the medications they may need -- and some education on when and how to use them -- from their provider before traveling. then they can self-treat as long as they have only a mild to moderate case of travelers' diarrhea.	should i see a doctor before starting antibiotics for travelers' diarrhea?

you can have both medicare and va coverage though they don't work together. medicare won't pay for any care you receive at a va facility. but va benefits can be used to help pay for services that medicare doesn't cover. there's no cost to enrolling in medicare part a so you may as well do that. the possible advantage of enrolling in medicare part b coverage (which pays for outpatient care and does come with a monthly cost of about $104) is that you'll gain access to services outside of the va system. when it comes to covering the cost of prescription drugs the va coverage is in many cases more generous than that of medicare part d so it may or may not be beneficial for you to purchase a part d plan. the best thing to do is talk with someone who can help walk you through your options and help you determine the best course of action for your medical and financial needs. you can get free assistance with medicare by contacting your local state insurance assistance program which you can find by visiting www. medicare. gov/contacts or by calling 1-800-633-4227.	i am covered by the va with a rating of 100%. would i still benefit from medicare or medicaid?

hydrocodone is synthetic; codeine is not. hydrocodone is a prescription painkiller that is more commonly known by the brand name vicodin a drug that was originally used to control pain after surgery from an injury or an illness. hydrocodone is an opiate narcotic from the same drug family as heroin and oxycontin but is synthetic. codeine is a short-acting prescription painkiller also from the opiate class of drugs but is not synthetic. short-acting means that the effects only last a few hours which make it more dangerous especially in chronic users because it increases the likeliness of drug overdose. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.	what is difference between hydrocodone and codeine?
nyquil is a nonprescription cough and cold product that is available in a number of different formulations. it typically contains an antihistamine a cough suppressant and a pain reliever/fever reducer. all of these active ingredients should be safe for a person with diabetes. people with diabetes should avoid medications that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine which are decongestants. fortunately pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are typically not included in nighttime cough and cold formulations. nyquil syrup does contain high fructose corn syrup. so it may raise blood sugar levels. if you're considering using nyquil i would recommend using nyquil liquicaps which would not have the same effect on your blood sugar. it's important to note that when treating a cold pharmacists and health care providers match a person's symptoms to the appropriate active ingredients. it may be possible that a multi-symptom product such as nyquil contains more active ingredients than you need to treat your symptoms. talk with your pharmacist who can help you select the best cough and cold product for your symptoms. if you have high blood pressure no. there is cold medicine that can be taken such as coricidan	can a person with type 2 diabetes take nyquil?
"i'm glad you asked. a nutritional supplement is not likely to help with premature ejaculation and there's no scientific evidence any of these ""male enhancement"" products actually help with male sexual performance. what concerns me is the number of these ""all natural"" ""herbal"" supplements that have been found (at least in the u. s. ) to contain actual prescription medications designed to treat erectile dysfunction. the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) has issued several alerts and recalls over the past few years on this type of product (though not vigormax specifically that i know of). the addition of these prescription drugs to over-the-counter dietary supplements is illegal and dangerous. manufacturers do not disclose these drugs on the label. so my advice to you is to seek medical treatment for your premature ejaculation issue and to give the nutritional supplements a pass. some things you can do to help with premature ejaculation: stop smoking drinking or using illicit drugs use a condom to reduce sensation in the penis try different sexual positions to reduce stimulation until ejaculation is desired sometimes doctors will prescribe antidepressant medications to treat premature ejaculation. hope this helps!"	is it safe to use vigormax supplement for premature ejaculation and vitality in sex? . i am 47. male. no health problem including diabetese. height 5ft 10 in. weight 82 kg. bp normally is (130 - 85)

to prevent high blood pressure first consider your diet. a healthy diet can go a long way toward preventing high blood pressure. trying following the dietary approaches to stop hypertension eating plan also known as the dash diet which emphasizes plenty of fruits and vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products. studies conducted by the national institutes of health have shown that the dash diet can dramatically lower blood pressure. and the results show up fast? often within two weeks. at the same time cut down on salt (sodium chloride) which can raise blood pressure. the national high blood pressure education program recommends no more than 2 300 milligrams of sodium a day. the ideal is even lower? only 1 500. for the average man who consumes about 4 200 milligrams a day that requires a big change. but studies show that the lower your salt intake the lower your blood pressure. along with a healthier diet it is smart to be as active as possible to prevent high blood pressure. in 2007 researchers at the university of minnesota published results from a study of almost 4 000 people between the ages of 15 and 30 who were followed over time. the more active they were the lower their risk of developing hypertension. a few other changes can also keep your blood pressure in check. both excessive alcohol consumption and smoking can raise blood pressure. men who drink alcohol should stick to no more than two standard drinks a day. and if you smoke the advice is obvious: get serious about quitting.	how can i prevent high blood pressure?
"it's always nerve-wracking to think about going under anesthesia isn't it? you're wise to think about how your medication might affect the experience. let me set your mind at ease by saying in general your anesthesiologist should not have difficulty providing general anesthesia even though you take adderall. of course ""going under"" always has some risks. however by telling the anesthesia provider what medications you take you're helping him or her make the experience as safe as possible. a few days before your surgery you should have an appointment or phone call with a nurse who will give you instructions regarding what medications to take or stop taking before your surgery. be sure to tell her or him about all the medications you take regularly including vitamins and other supplements. if you don't receive any instructions at least a day or two before your surgery call your surgeon's office. on the day of surgery your anesthesiology provider will meet with you. be sure you again tell him or her about all the medications you take. this will help your anesthesiologist to give you the best care possible. good luck with your surgery!"	are there any risks going under general anastesia while taking adderall reguraly? . im going in to have my gullbladder removed and im worried about going under and having complications due to the use of adderall and its effect on the heart.

hi here’s a list that may help you. many arrhythmias occur as a complication of a heart condition. for example ischaemic heart disease (which causes angina and heart attacks). this reduces the blood supply to parts of the heart which may include parts of the conducting system. a damaged section of heart muscle (following a heart attack) can trigger an arrhythmia or block electrical impulses. heart valve diseases can cause the heart muscle to enlarge which can trigger abnormal electrical activity. for example af is a common complication of mitral valve disease. high blood pressure can put strain on the heart and cause arrhythmias. age-related degeneration (ageing) around the conducting fibres is one cause of complete heart block. cardiomyopathy (a disorder of the heart muscle) can sometimes cause arrhythmias. some arrhythmias are due to abnormalities in the electrical pathways which are present from birth. one example is an extra electrical pathway which sometimes develops between the atria and ventricles. this can cause a type of svt. (however symptoms may not first start until you are a young adult. ) some congenital heart defects are associated with certain arrhythmias. inflammation of the heart and other less common heart disorders are other possible causes. your should find out that sex is not the bad fro what your asking a good orgasm does release some good things around our body’s as for exercise as long as its not to herd or fast you should be ok swimming would be good for you its gentle and less stressful and also low impact. hope this helps you. good luck	can arrhythmia be caused by extreme exercise or sexual activity?

whether or not health plans available under the affordable care act will cover second opinions will vary according to the individual insurance plan. there is no mandate under the law requiring insurers to cover second opinions. so if that is important to you be sure to check with the individual carrier before you sign up for a plan. and because insurers may distinguish between the kinds of second opinions they cover (e. g. may cover a consultation with another doctor but not necessarily a round of new expensive diagnostic tests) be sure to be specific.	will second opinions be covered under new health care plans?
most helpful answer no the sperm are just fine swimming through a little vaginal blood. vaginal blood will not prevent pregnancy but having sex during a true menstrual period means that you are not ovulating. if you are not ovulating you cannot conceive. sperm can be viable for a week or so trapped in vaginal or cervical mucous so having unprotected sex toward the end of your period is iffy so never count on this as a 100% method of birth control. some women will have vaginal bleeding mid-cycle (at a time of ovulation) so don't get fooled. for that extra-added insurance it is always wise for couples to use condoms.	does vagina blood kill sperm and prevents pregnancy?

yes. women need to get a little more calcium after menopause for instance to maintain strong bones. the recommendation increases from 1 000 mg a day before menopause to 1 200 mg after menopause. on the other hand women need less iron after menopause since they are no longer losing iron with menstruation. both before and after menopause the basic advice is the same. eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits vegetables whole grains and low-fat dairy to get the nutrients you need. consider taking a multivitamin just to make sure all your needs are covered. and talk to your doctor about whether to take additional supplements such as calcium and vitamin d.	do women's nutritional requirements change after menopause?

there are certain exercises and activities that can be harmful if performed during pregnancy. they include: holding your breath during any activity. activities where falling is likely (such as skiing and horseback riding). contact sports such as softball football basketball and volleyball. any exercise that may cause even mild abdominal trauma such as activities that include jarring motions or rapid changes in direction. activities that require extensive jumping hopping skipping bouncing or running. deep knee bends full sit-ups double leg raises and straight-leg toe touches. bouncing while stretching. waist-twisting movements while standing. heavy exercise spurts followed by long periods of no activity. exercise in hot humid weather.	what exercises should be avoided during pregnancy?
these bacteria are spread through direct contact with mucus from the nose or throat of persons who are infected or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. ill persons such as those who have strep throat or skin infections are most likely to spread the infection. persons who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. treating an infected person with an antibiotic for 24 hours or longer generally eliminates their ability to spread the bacteria. however it is important to complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. it is not likely that household items like plates cups or toys spread these bacteria.	how are group a streptococcal bacteria spread?

based on the type of hpv you may or may not have visible genital warts. common hpv types 6 and 11 produce visible warts. these warts may go away on their own stay the same or increase in amount. other hpv types such as 16 and 18 do not produce visible genital warts. these types which may be found with a pap test are associated with precancerous cervical cell changes and cervical cancer. hpv infection and cervical cell changes in women most precancerous or cancerous cell changes associated with hpv infection occur on the cervix. this is because the cells of the cervix naturally undergo changes in an area called the transformation zone. this process can cause cervical cells to become abnormal when they are infected with hpv. infection with high-risk types of hpv increase the chance that a woman with hpv will develop abnormal cervical cell changes. it is important to have regular exams with your doctor. if your doctor finds abnormal cells on a pap test the cells can be treated to help prevent them from changing to cancer. hpv infection during pregnancy the presence of hpv and abnormal cell changes does not affect the outcome of the pregnancy. a pregnant woman infected with the type of hpv that causes genital warts may have more complicated warts than a woman who is not pregnant. genital warts may increase in size bleed or become infected with bacteria. your doctor may recommend treatment. warts may be passed on to the newborn but this is rare. hpv infection and cancer in men it is not clear whether men who are infected with hpv on the penis are more likely to have precancerous or cancerous changes on the penis than men who are not infected. because hpv does cause cell changes more research is being done to determine whether hpv increases the risk of penile cancer. in the united states cancer of the penis is extremely rare (fewer than 1 case in 100 000 occurs each year). studies have shown that the risk of penile cancer is extremely low in circumcised men. among men who receive anal sex hpv infection of the anal canal is associated with an increased risk of anal cancer. this risk may be especially high in men who also have hiv infection. 2 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what happens to someone when they get genital warts human papillomavirus?

regular physical activity protects against crc. we can reduce our risk by as much as 24% if we just get up and get moving. aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also protect against crc. statins (medication that lowers cholesterol) may affect crc in a positive way. postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was shown in the women’s health initiative study to reduce the incidence of crc. dietary calcium magnesium fish oils and vitamin b6 all have positive effects in reducing crc. and non-herbal tea and possibly coffee a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red and processed meats may all be protective against crc. antioxidants folic acid and a diet high in fiber have not been shown to aid in preventing cancer of the colon and rectum. but the following have been shown to increase our risk: obesity alcohol cigarette smoking diabetes and being insulin resistant. drinking more than 45 grams per day of alcohol increases a person’s life risk for colorectal cancer. if a person’s body mass index (bmi) is over 25 there is a 1. 5 fold increase in their risk. researchers also noted an increase in incidence of crc and death from crc if a person smoked. and in another study that compared those with diabetes and non-diabetics the risk of crc was 30% higher for the diabetic group. another factor that increases a person’s risk for crc is inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or crohn’s disease. inflammation throughout the gi tract may be the culprit which explains why aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs seem to protect against crc. finally if you have a family history of colorectal cancer you must be observed closely by your doctor. if you are diagnosed with colon polyps or have family members diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 55 years of age you should begin aggressive surveillance.	what are the risk factors for colorectal cancer?

hello thanks for submitting your question here. as per the description you have undergone repeated surgery for ovarian torsion where the ovary is preserved. this sounds a bit different as in torsion it is a dictum to remove the whole ovary. now as you are having recurrent pain from the ovaries you need an obg consultation right now. there may be possibility of endometriosis which might present with similar feature. you need to have the biopsy of previous operation and only after few blood tests and clinical examination; a definite opinion can be formed. sincerely dr bhattacharyya	"hello- i am a 24 year old female 5""4 & 115 lb & was diagnosed with pcos at 19. i've always been active & extremely healthy. spironolactone & an iud helped with acne & pain but in 2013 i had an ovarian torsion requiring surgery & they saved my right ovary. i began having hair loss from telogen effogen & reoccurant yeast infections- i was diagnosed as pre-diabetic & cut sugar our from my already low sugar diet. fast forward to january of this year i went to the er due to pain from another torsion on the right side & again the ovary was saved. i was put on ortho tricyclen lo & still have my iud & take the spironolactone but had horribly painful cysts last month which brought me to the er but with no torsion they did nothing. the pain has been intermitten since & is getting more severe. it feels like ice cubes in my ovaries & warm water/electic shocks down my thighs. i had the hpv vaccine but my last pap showed up irregular & the biopsy of cysts got lost. any thoughts on what happening?"

go to your doctor and get tested for genital herpes. a doctor may take a sample from what appears to be a genital herpes sore and examine it under a microscope. you can also have a blood test for genital herpes. the blood test looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system would have made when you were infected. the second type of herpes simplex virus hsv-2 almost always infects the genitals so if antibodies to hsv-2 are detected in your blood you probably have genital herpes. a blood test that shows antibodies to the other type of herpes virus hsv-1 means you could have genital or oral herpes. that's because oral herpes typically caused by hsv-1 can be spread to the genitals during oral sex.	how can i find out if i've been infected with genital herpes?

simply put the cigarette smoke attracts inflammatory cells (white blood cells including neutrophils lymphocytes and macrophages) into the lung. then the inflammatory cells release substances called proteases. the proteases dissolve the proteins in the alveolar walls (septae) and thereby destroy the septae. as a result the alveoli join together (coalesce) to form the larger irregular inefficient air sacs. it turns out that about half of all smokers develop emphysema. mild emphysema is seen occasionally in non-smokers and may be due to passive smoking (exposure to other people smoking) and industrial air pollution. severe emphysema however is seen only in smokers or in some people with rare inherited diseases (e. g. alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency). still it takes about 30 years of smoking to develop fatal emphysema. this is because people usually don't die from emphysema until more than 60% of the lung tissue is affected.	how does emphysema happen?

sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like you've done the right thing by seeing your doctor and having your heart and kidneys checked out. i'm not sure why you're taking aspirin unless your doctor specifically recommended you take it. aspirin will not address the swelling issue you describe. aspirin will treat swelling due to inflammation (such as from an injury) to some extent but it will not have any effect on swelling due to edema (water retention) which is what you seem to be describing. i suggest you discontinue the aspirin unless otherwise directed by your doctor. it is not uncommon for people to retain fluid in the legs as they age. even very active people can have issues with fluid retention in the legs simply because the veins don't work as well when we age. i suggest you return to your doctor to discuss the issue in more detail. it's possible as you say he does not have an answer for the swelling problem. but it's also possible the issue simply requires more investigation to arrive at a diagnosis. if you're concerned about the swelling and frequent urination (i would be! ) then that's a good enough reason to return to your doctor for more conversation. wishing you well!	age 83. swelling both ankles. reduced salt. heart kidney ok. swelling ankles periodic. dr. checked heart kidney ok. bp fluctuating 110 to 155. do take potassium gluconate 50 mg. profuse urination. three times during night. had radical prostactomy 13 years ago. psa 0. 5 from 0. 05 in 13 years. aspirin 175 mg. helpful to some extent. swelling some time last many days. no other problem. why it could be? my dr. has no answer.

nohard said it perfectly. if you want to be 100% sure go to your physician and have him run the proper tests. you may also want to request to have your hormone levels tested because you could also just be experiencing perimenopausal symptoms.	im 40yrs old. ive missed 2 straight periods. ive never been regluar. i have no symtoms of menopause. ive never had a regular cycle. me and my husband has never used protection. i had my tubes tied about 10 years ago. ive missed my last two periods. my stomach is bloated. more at the top and going down. i know having your tubes tied is not 100% effective. because two of my aunts had children after their tubes were tied and burned. is it possible i could be pregnant? i did something that freaked me out today. i did the pencil on a string test on my self. it said a boy then a girl.

i have long loved the flavor and versatility of mushrooms in cooking. i was even more thrilled with these fungi (aka fun guy) when i learned of the great nutritional benefits. mushrooms have long been studied as antioxidants — literally books can be written on their nutritional benefits. suffice it to say that when it’s raining or snowing outside there is something beyond “comfort” in a bowl of mushroom soup! not only are mushrooms packed with nutrients incredible antioxidants low-cal fat-free and cholesterol-free they are delicious! my “go to” mushroom is a crimini aka baby bella (small portabellos). they look like the white button varieties but they are brown. they have an earthy flavor and are great in everything from salads to soups to pastas to chicken or meat dishes. you can buy them loose in bulk or already sliced for you. simply slice them thin and sauté them in a bit of extra virgin olive oil and garlic with a splash of soy sauce. the water will start to cook out of the mushrooms and you can add to a grilled chicken breast or a burger or piece of fish. by adding chopped fresh cilantro or basil at the end you can even further expand the flavors. if you are using dried mushrooms look for one that has some porcini in it. the flavor is so intense and can elevate the flavors of a recipe instantly. shiitake mushrooms are another favorite of mine. they have a distinct flavor that goes well with asian dishes. i would use a shiitake in a noodle dish that has veggies ginger garlic and soy. they are also great roasted whole and tossed with just a bit of extra virgin olive oil soy sauce and sesame seeds. then top on a steak or serve with wilted spinach as a side dish. i would not use shiitakes in an italian-style dish that has butter or cream.	do mushrooms have nutritional value? which taste the best?
thank you for the detailed information. i am happy to see your father improve gradually. here is what i suggest. there is no other medicine for stiffness. however physiotherapy should be carried out aggressively to prevent worsening of stiffness. one should rule out infection of the bed sore. if there is infection antibiotics are needed and rarely surgical debridement might be indicated. if there is no infection you can also apply phenytoin powder on the bed sore. the powder helps to hasten the healing process. i do see that there are chances of improvement. but i believe that he will not be able to do his daily activities independently and will remain dependent on others. in the latest scan i see that there is hydrocephalus also called post traumatic hydrocephalus. if the craniotomy flap is tense and there is increase in the water content in the brain he will benefit from ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery to relieve the water accumulation in the brain. this surgery can be done by the same neurosurgeon who performed the first surgery. i cannot comment whether he will be able to speak or not. all i can say is that he might improve in his sensorium (consciousness) some more. for further information consult a neurosurgeon online --> <link>	Hi doctor,My dad is without ventilator support since 40 days and his tracheostomy has also removed five days back.

i can't tell if you mean you haven't had a period in 10 months and now you're bleeding or if you just stopped your hrt and now you're bleeding for 2 weeks. either way. yes if you have been bleeding for 2 weeks you should see your doctor. your body may need help adjusting to stopping the hrt (if you recently stopped it). your doctor may need to give you something to stop the bleeding. the concern would be that if you're losing a lot of blood you could develop anemia. so at this point the bleeding may need to be stopped and that requires a visit to your doctor. if you haven't had a period in 10 months and you're bleeding now you definitely need to be seen to determine what's causing the bleeding.	i have gone9mo this time10mos prviously after stoppinghrtsincehaving period. have been bleeding 2 wks. should i see my md?

is this the only liver function test you have? i wanted to trend it. plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) and protonix (pantoprazole) both can cause elevated liver function test but it is relatively rare with protonix. i also want to make sure that you are not using aspirin tylenol or cholesterol medications since they can have direct effects on the liver. another important point is that the slight elevation of lipase and blood sugar can happen in pancreatitis which again could be a rare side effect of protonix. but this point goes against the fact that the elevation of blood sugar is out of the proportion to the lipase levels. a person who has prediabetes may develop full blown diabetes transiently under physiological stress. i was trying to understand if you had been tested for diabetes ever and if this blood sugar was obtained in fasting. for high blood sugars i would suggest that you try to avoid high carbohydrate diet soda bakery products white bread or pasta and juices. hydrate yourself with plenty of water. can you please share your symptoms and for how long did you have them? please also share if you have been worked up for lupus or autoimmune hepatitis and your entire medication list if you can? revert back with the details to an internal medicine physician online --><link>	Hi doctor,I have been taking   Protonix  for  almost three weeks  for  acid reflux.

"an upset stomach is one of the most common discomforts during pregnancy. nausea is a result of hormonal changes and most often occurs early in pregnancy until your body adjusts to the increased production of hormones. nausea can begin in early pregnancy but is usually gone by the fourth month. it can occur at any time of the day but may be worse in the morning when your stomach is empty (this is often called ""morning sickness"") or if you are not eating enough. recommendations: if nausea is a problem in the morning eat dry foods like cereal toast or crackers before getting out of bed. or try eating a high-protein snack such as lean meat or cheese before going to bed (protein takes longer to digest). eat small meals or snacks every two to three hours rather than three large meals. eat slowly and chew your food completely. sip on fluids throughout the day. avoid large amounts of fluids at one time. try cool clear fruit juices such as apple or grape juice. avoid spicy fried or greasy foods. if you are bothered by strong smells eat foods cold or at room temperature and avoid odors that bother you. talk to your doctor about taking vitamin b6 or other treatments. contact your health care provider if your vomiting is constant or so severe that you can't keep fluids or foods down. this can cause dehydration and should be treated right away."	how can i manage nausea or vomiting during pregnancy?

many people over-eat when they are upset depressed or anxious. the easy answer would be for you to see your medical provider so that you can have your depression properly treated first however i know this is not a simple solution. losing weight is not easy. if it was no one would be overweight. it comes down to simple math: you need to eat less than your body needs to maintain your current weight and you need to expend more calories. as little as a 500 calorie reduction per day of what you are eating now could result in a 50 pound weight loss in a year. before starting any weight loss diet it would be best for you to see your medical provider for an examination determine the amount of weight it would be ideal for you to lose and determine the best way for you to achieve this important goal. at the same visit you can address those triggers that make you feel depressed. if need be you can ask for a referral to counselor. anyone can lose weight. all they need to the proper method and the personal motivation. if you need help then some of the commercial weight loss programs like weight watchers can be of great help to you. the group dynamics can be quite motivating.	i'm 5'4 26 year old female weighing 180 pounds and i want to lose all excess fat and weight? yet i eat when depressed.

surgery to remove cancer may be used to treat metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. the type of surgery chosen depends upon the stage of the cancer. surgery choices surgical options include: bowel resection. this operation involves cutting into the abdomen to reach the area of the colon or rectum that is affected by the cancer. the surgeon cuts out the cancer as well as the parts of the colon or rectum that are next to it. then the two healthy ends of the colon or rectum are sewn back together. liver resection. in this operation the surgeon cuts out cancer that has spread to the liver as well as parts of the liver that are next to the cancer. up to half of your liver can be removed as long as the rest is healthy. two other methods to destroy cancer cells in the liver include radio waves (radiofrequency ablation) and heat (microwave coagulation). cryosurgery. also called cryotherapy this type of surgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. it is used when the tumors in the liver are still fairly small. if cancer that has returned to your intestine is large more of your colon or rectum may have to be removed. the ends of your colon or rectum are rejoined during surgery. if they can't be rejoined you may need a colostomy. most people do not need a permanent colostomy. for more information see: bowel disease: caring for your ostomy. when cancer has spread to other parts of the body the kind of surgery you will need depends on where the cancer is and how big the tumor is. sometimes surgery is used not to cure your cancer but to make your life more comfortable. if a tumor is blocking your colon for example the surgeon may remove it to allow your intestine to work normally. if advanced cancer is blocking your rectum your doctor may place an expandable tube called a stent in the rectum to unblock it. what to think about surgery may be used to remove metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer that is confined to the colon or that has spread to the liver lungs or bones. surgery does not usually cure metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer but it may relieve pain and discomfort slow the spread of the disease and help you live longer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.	what surgery options do i have for colorectal cancer metastatic or recurrent?

"vertigo is probably one of the most miserable of all human afflictions. unfortunately the cause are many. finding a cause or causes can be a diagnostic nightmare. and the treatments are not very good. the best specialist for you to see would be an ear nose and throat (ent) specialist -- one with expertise in inner ear disorders. not all causes of vertigo are related to the inner ear however. some are called ""central vertigo"" -- a cause that originates in the brain. fyi: i have an inner ear disorder that results in occasional vertigo myself. valium is often tried to quiet down the neurological responses in the inner ear. sometimes it helps."	how can valium help vertigo. chronic vertigo a patients worst nightmare. to live everyday feeling the sensations of everything moving around you brings about nausea to high extremes. vertigo may be calmed to some small point but never truely leave you then the vertigo takes new form robbing the use of speech arms legs and doubling your vision. i ask is there not one physician that can rid this terrible disease from ones body or are all suffering patients just pushed aside to live life feeling sick inside?

getting a driver's license is a monumental event in most teenagers' lives. it's a rite of passage that many teens with epilepsy worry that they'll miss. however in most cases teens with controlled seizures can get a license like anyone else. the laws vary from state to state but generally if a person with epilepsy is on medication and hasn't had a seizure recently he or she can get a license. just how long the person must be seizure-free differs depending on where you live. also some states may allow you to get a license if you're having seizures only at a specific time of day when you wouldn't be driving (such as right before bed). some parents worry that their teens might not tell them about a seizure for fear they would lose their license. it's important to talk to your teenager about the significance of this information. having a seizure while driving could not only injure the teen but other people as well.	what happens when a teenager who has epilepsy is old enough to drive?
well each person is very different which means that each human body has different levels of tolerance. for example one person's body may be able to handle the 30% burns easier than others. the body could go into shock from any traumatic experience such as a burn or being exposed to mercury. the amount that the body can handle before going into shock is different for each person. you also have to take into consideration the health of the person. for example someone with healthy lungs usually has no complications recovering from bronchitis while someone with a condition such as asthma may have several complications because it is harder for the body to heal itself.	how can so little damage or so little of something cause mortality? . how can so little of something or so small a percentage of damage cause something as severe as mortality? for example dying from as little as 30% burns on your body (not from something more common sense -to me- like 50% or higher) or having 7% plaque blocking your arteries or even ingesting as little as 100 micrograms of mercury would kill you.

for vitamin b-12 and folate deficiency anemia the treatment depends on the cause of the deficiency. if your body stores are depleted of vitamin b-12 your doctor will most likely prescribe vitamin b-12 injections and may also recommend high doses of b-12 supplements or a b-12 nasal spray. there is a good chance that many of the symptoms of deficiency will improve once the body is provided with the needed b-12. most people with vitamin b-12 deficiency have a permanent inability to absorb vitamin b-12 and will need injections every one to three months or pills daily for the rest of their lives. some forms of gastric bypass surgery are associated with deficiencies of iron vitamin b12 and other nutrients typically absorbed in the part of the stomach that is bypassed. your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of vitamin b-12 in your diet. good dietary sources of vitamin b-12 are meat liver and kidney; fish oysters and clams; and milk cheese and eggs. if you have a folate deficiency your doctor will prescribe folate supplements and may recommend you increase the amount of folate in your diet. good dietary sources of folate include fresh fruits green leafy vegetables cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower broccoli and brussel sprouts) liver and kidney dairy products and whole grain cereals. vegetables should be eaten raw or lightly cooked.	how are vitamin b-12 and folate deficiency anemia treated?

that's a good (and very reasonable) question. i suggest you call your surgeon's office and ask the nurse or pa. generally whenever someone has scalp incisions we recommend they wait until the incisions are fully healed staples/sutures removed and so on before they apply any hair color. you want to make sure you don't have any openings in the skin when you apply the colorant because this could be irritating or lead to infection. so again best bet is to call your surgeon's office and ask. they can give you specific information. glad to hear you survived the brain aneurysm!	how soon can i safely color my hair after surgery for a brain aneurysm?

hi i m not a cardiologist or anything but due to my experience with anxiety i can tell you that it had caused my heart to beat so fast that it made my chest hurt and i felt short of breath. to answer your question to the best of my knowledge arteries do not go from normal to clogged in 7 months unless you have risks such as family history of heart disease not being active and eating unhealthy foods (high in salt and fat). i would recommend however to call up your cardiologist and ask for yourself to get checked out again just to be sure.	can your arteries go from normal to clogged in 7 months? i was told i was fine and now i'm scared it has changed. i went to the cardiologist about seven months ago. i had 2 ekgs and an electrocardiogram. everything was normal. i had a very emotionally stressful week and the entire week i've had anxiety issues. during the anxiety i had slight chest pain on my left side. i woke up one morning and i my pectoral muscles were tight and felt like i had a strong workout without working out. during the next 6 days i've had pain and tingling in my arm/under my armpit. is this just a reaction on my anxiety

biotin is involved in the breakdown of carbs protein and fat but i have never heard it being used to treat digestive issues. additional biotin would only help if there was a deficiency which is not common (see this article for symptoms). you could always take a multivitamin which would cover you. i recommend addressing your diet and how to improve it to help your symptoms. getting a second opinion and seeing a registered dietitian who specializes in digestive issues can help. good luck! read more: constipation digestive disorders i bs with constipation	biotin & digestion. after stumbling upon an article in my health textbook i found that biotin is actually essential to digestion & also produced in the colon! i thought the biotin was what was causing my digestive issues (being constipated after the morning 'go). how is this possibl? . omy doc says i could have irritable bowel because my mother has it. i am 19. don't want to ask my dr. cause i want a second opinion on this.

if your husband's work-based plan doesn't provide any coverage for prescription drugs it may not meet the standards under the law. i suggest you check with his employer to find out if it meets the aca's requirements. if it doesn't there is a possibility you can qualify for a tax credit to help lower the cost of insurance you buy through the marketplace. in most cases employer-based insurance is the best deal around even when it's pricey. still even if you don't qualify for a tax credit it may be worth shopping all of your options to see if you can find a plan at a cost you can cover.	my husband was diagnosed with metabolic disorder and high blood pressure. . his employer pays $200 toward his health insurance costs of $800/month. he is 62. we just can't afford these rates any longer plus co-pays etc. no prescription coverage. we pray he will qualify for new insurance. we lost our business 4 years ago and are building a new career. we are trying to hold on to our home. i am disabled and receive disability.
not knowing the specific medical information regarding your case a simple phone call to your urologist would most likely answer your question in a more patient-specific manner. hi found you this info on a site called www. drcatalona. com blood in semen after prostatic biopsy: how long after a prostate biopsy can you expect to still have blood in your semen? it is not rare for a man to still have blood in his semen as long as two or three months after a prostatic biopsy. blood in semen following prostate biopsy: relating to one of your other questions - blood in semen after prostatic biopsy which you say may last for 2-3 mos - does it help to clear it any better/faster by increasing the frequency of ejaculation or does further aggravating the prostate in such a way delay healing? there is no solid data on this issue. after a week or so after the biopsy i believe that more frequent ejaculation would help clear the semen. if the blood becomes more bright red (rather than rust colored or brown) it may indicate that the situation is being aggravated. googled this blood in ejaculate after prostate biopsy lots more info all saying much the same just bvy guys who have had the same. hope this helps you. good luck	is masturbation dangerous after prostate biopsy. with blood in the ejaculate is it dangerous to masturbate or should you allow time for the bleeding to disappear or does masturbation speed up the process?

that's a great question for your doctor. i'd say to wear them until your doctor tells you it's ok to stop. compression stockings are worn after procedures like hip replacement to help reduce the chance of a blood clot ( deep vein thrombosis or dvt ). dvts may not occur until a couple of weeks post-surgery so you should wear the hose at least that long. if you have any fluid buildup in your legs you also need to keep wearing the compression stockings. fluid buildup can be a sign of poor circulation which again can lead to the development of a dvt. so in a nutshell seek your surgeon's advice as to when you can stop wearing the stockings. and don't stop too soon! all the best to you!	how long should you wear compression stockings after hip replacement surgery
"unfortunately sleep aids are not recommended for use in pregnant women. there are some ""best practices"" that you may want to try such as creating a relaxing sleep environment (make sure your bed is comfortable keep your bedroom at a controlled temperature minimize light and noise and remove clocks so they cannot be seen from the bed) establish a regular sleep schedule (basically going to bed and waking up around the same time each day) avoiding naps during the day establishing a relaxing bedtime routine and avoid activities such as watching television in bed."	are there any sleep aids that a pregnant woman can take?

facial and jaw pain is common in fm. several structures including the head (scalp and brain) neck tmj and facial/jaw muscles all have nerve branches to the face that can lead to pain numbness and altered sensations (called dysesthesias). if the pain comes and goes in relationship to another area of pain i. e. tmj jaw neck then it may be referred pain from myospasms or tm joint etc. if it comes spontaneously and feels like shocks or stabs then it could be more neuralgia-mediated like trigeminal neuralgia. rarely in someone with fm a different cause such as ms bell's palsy acoustic neuroma or even a viral infection (cold) can cause face and jaw pain. but these other conditions are usually evident by additional symptoms or a different clinical course that your doctor can determine by evaluating you. i try various treatments on my patients with facial pain including meds that block nerve pain (i. e. anti-seizure meds snris [serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors] tricyclics) and topicals with helpful meds (patches compounded cream). therapies including tns trail or injections or bite splints or other treatments can be tried depending on the individual's cause of pain. as usual i can't provide specific advice for anyone here but i encourage you to work together with your doctor for your symptoms.	i have stabbing pain along my cheekbone to the jaw and upper section of my teeth. is it that common in fibromyalgia?

there are so many different medications and we could go for hours if we went through every single one. but it really depends on what the area is. if it's a case of nasal decongestants or vitamins or things like that there are some that can't and there are some that can. but by developing that relationship with your pharmacist getting to know us on a first name basis we will be able to talk to you about anything even prescription products. we have data on prescription products about whether or not certain ones are safe to use also we can help call your doctor if you have any other concerns about a prescription. you may have been taking before you got pregnant and ask them if they want you to continue with it. but talking to your pharmacist developing that relationship that's really the key.	what common medications should i avoid during my pregnancy?

if you have two partners maybe each one of them has two or more partners so unprotected sex is never safe. you would essentially be having sex with every partner they have ever had since some stds are not very obvious. and of course don't forget about unplanned pregnancies. you may not want to be a parent but one of them may have some hidden plans. don't be a fool and play sexual roulette. if you are a male use condoms. if you are a female insist on them always. hi just don't always remember safe sex is best at your age otherwise you heading for trouble in a big way wait till you find the right guy then with the help of bc you can start riding bare back. till then think condoms every time silly poem when ever you want a rat a tat tat tat be sure to wear a mac. good luck	i have 2 parteners how long should i wait to have unprotected sex with either one before it is safe again? .

typically when you are taking a medication that makes you more sensitive to sun sunscreen alone is not going to be enough. you really have to have sun smart behavior. what this means is trying to stay in the shade as much as possible and you can follow the shadow rule. the shorter your shadow the more dangerous the rays of the sun. so when you look down and there is no shadow; typically that's around noon you look up chances are the sun is right above you and that's when those uvb rays are very harmful. most medications that make you sensitive to the sun are really making you sensitive to the uva rays so it doesn't always have to be a sunny day in order for you to have increased risk for burning. so don't be fooled by whether or not it's sunny or cloudy. one is you can follow the shadow rule but two is you really have to be sun smart. wear a hat when you can wear sun protective clothing if possible. apply a sunscreen of an spf 30 or higher up to an spf 50 after that it doesn't make much difference and reapply that sunscreen regularly and then avoid being in the sun as much as possible.	i am taking a medication and my pharmacist says that i have to be careful in the sun. isn't wearing sunscreen enough?

have you had your blood sugar tested lately? you describe some of the classic symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. this condition can occur when you eat a quantity of simple sugars and the body responds by producing an excessive amount of insulin. this over-reaction by the body leaves too little glucose (sugar) available to your cells for processing. symptoms of hypoglycemia can include: nausea/vomiting sweating dizziness/lightheadedness fainting shakiness heart palpitations blurred or double vision i suggest you see your primary care doctor to tell him or her about these symptoms. your provider may want you to take a fasting blood glucose test to make sure you don't have diabetes. meanwhile if you experience symptoms before you can see a doctor you can try eating a small quantity of candy or sugar to see if the symptoms resolve. it sounds odd but if your blood sugar is low you actually want to add some sugar to your body -- not a lot though. too much sugar can cause a hypoglycemic reaction all over again! wishing you well!	can sugar intake cause neausea light headed strange feeling in top body and to pass out? . i had a ekg done and nothing but it also seems that when i eat sugar i get i little head ache and my blood pressure goes up.

home pregnancy tests are very accurate so it's unlikely that you were pregnant before especially if you were at least 7 to 10 days late for your period. chapped lips aren't a common pregnancy symptom but it sounds like you had this issue before. given the recurring problem with your period and the other symptoms you're having i would not assume this is pregnancy. it's worth a visit to your doctor to find out what's going on. there's no harm in taking another pregnancy test but if it's negative call your doctor so you can find out what's going on.	my period had been late 3 months in a row. i have been constipated and i nearly fainted. could i be pregnant? . my lips have also become very chapped and they did in my first pregnancy too. i have taken a couple pregnancy test the first 2 months my period was late and they were negative but i havent taken on in over a month.

1. taking the time to cook your family’s meals is probably the most important step to cutting back on the salt. processed and prepared foods usually contain substantially more salt than you’d ever add to your home prepared meals. 2. buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables. if you buy canned look for “no salt added” on the label. 3. choose alternate seasonings to flavor your food. if you use a seasoning blend select one that is salt-free. 4. be a label reader. salt will be listed as “sodium. ” select items that contain 5% of less of your daily salt intake. steer clear of food items that contain 20% or more of your daily salt intake! 5. look for hidden sources of salt: salad dressing canned soup/broth and packaged mixes. 6. love sushi? pick low-salt soy sauce (it usually has a green top). 7. avoid or limit high-salt meats - those that are smoked cured or processed. 8. don’t put the salt shaker on the kitchen table.	what are some ways i can cut back on my family's salt intake?

"the short answer is: no. but this deserves a bit more discussion. heartburn is a pain that you feel around mid-chest and is caused by acid moving back up into the esophagus from the stomach. this pain often will go away when you take an antacid product such as a chewable tablet like tums or rolaids or a liquid product like maalox. despite its name heartburn does not involve the heart. ischemia is a condition in which body tissue doesn't get enough oxygen usually due to decreased blood flow. the term ischemia is often applied to the heart muscle but ischemia can happen to any muscle or even the brain. when the heart suffers from ischemia it can trigger a pain response which is called ""angina. "" this pain also occurs mid-chest like heartburn so it can sometimes be tricky figuring out if chest pain is a result of stomach acid (heartburn) or ischemia. the two conditions (heartburn and ischemia) have different underlying sources and are not related except in terms of causing pain in the chest. i hope this helps!"	is heartburn associated with ischemia?

it’s no surprise that the latest version of the usda dietary guidelines continues to urge americans to eat less sugar. that’s a given with “sugar” generally being extra calories without any nutritional contribution and our high obesity rates. i think the biggest push should be to dramatically reduce our intake of sweetened beverages which don’t even seem to register in our brains and bodies as “consumed calories. ” talk about empty calories! it looks like we have another great reason to eat less sugar this year. sugar prices are predicted to go up for european manufacturers due to bad weather speculative hedging on supplies and stockpiling across the world. i’m guessing the sugar market in the u. s. may go through something similar. that means prices will probably go up for you and me at the supermarket when buying products containing sugar. yet another reason to think twice before buying processed food. suggestion: save money by baking your own muffins cakes and cookies. this way you can use less sugar (you can usually cut the sugar by a third from the original recipe) switch to using at least half whole-wheat flour and switch to using smarter cooking fats (like canola oil). think of it as a relaxing activity that you can do in the evening. in addition to your health your wallet may be better for it!	what are the benefits of eating less sugar?
sometimes it can be hard to get used to being healthy. this could be something as simple as having trouble with your digestion. try eating some greek yogurt getting more fiber and exercising some every day and see if that helps. if it doesn't help or if your symptoms get worse a visit with a doctor is in order. by the way gas can also cause spasms as can withdrawal from some of the drugs you were taking. colon cancer is always a possibility for all humans but in this case i would consider it to be less likely than simple gas from difficulty with digestion.	what's wrong with my digestive track? please help me it's beginning to ruin my life. for the last 2 months i have been converting my life to one that does not involve heavy alcohol use or smoking. however before all this started i frequently drank while on adderall xanax and accutane. now i've been having frequent gas issues while sitting and laying that keep me up at night and have been causing me to be depressed and anxious about my health. i keep telling myself its an early stage of colon cancer or something like that. i have also had spasms in my lower pelvic region.

"the good news is: probably not. the dtap vaccine (which includes dipetheria tetanus and pertussis) is considered protective for 10 years. we recommend everyone get re-vaccinated with dtap every decade. that said the only way to tell for sure you're protected (because not all vaccines ""take"" the way they're supposed to) is to look at your blood antibodies. if your blood contains antibodies toward tetanus then you're golden. bottom line: your best bet is to consult a health care provider. even if you're up to date on your tetanus vaccination that wound could get infected with bacteria which could cause problems. better to have it looked at and washed out if necessary. hope this helps!"	i had a dtap in 2011 and i stepped on a nail today. do i need to get a tetanus shot? . im 16

an allergy to your own urine is not possible. your labial itching may eventually help you overcome your fear of being examined since this may be the only way you can have this problem properly diagnosed. this is not something that can be done blindly over the internet based solely on a vague description. having a sympathetic female physician pa or nurse practitioner should ease your discomfort and fear especially if you disclose it prior to your visit. have a trusted friend go with you. your doctor can even provide you with a short-acting anti-anxiety medication to help you overcome your fear. in most cases a yeast infection is the underlying cause but since the labia is covered in skin and skin can have hundreds of dermatological conditions that cause itching it would likely be futile to try and treat a condition that is not even diagnosed.	my labia itch intensely especially after i urinate. no other symptoms. is it possible to be allergic to my urine? . i took a home test for a uti - negative. i took a 3 day course of monistat thinking it might be a yeast infection but that made no difference. i am 56 and celibate for several years but this itch has been going on for about 2 months. vagisil soothes the itch nicely but don't want to live on vagisil. obvious answer is to go to a doctor. problem is i have profound latrophobia - fear of doctors. an exam is out! i have allergies to everything so i tried new tp and detergent. no help. any ideas?

i have no way of assessing the severity of your injury over the internet nor predict if you will get a subsequent injury. in order to get those answers you would need to be examined first-hand (no pun intended) by a medical professional and perhaps have an x-ray of your hand to rule out a subtle fracture.	playing basketball and fell on left hand very painful yet no bruising or swelling. please help. i fell backwards and landed flat on hand. wasn't very painful at first but maybe adrenaline was masking the pain i don't know. i can still move my fingers almost normally but lower part of hand and wrist is very painful. should i continue practicing or would i risk injuring it more.
"it is possible to have light bleeding or spotting during pregnancy. my sister in law did with her oldest. but it wouldn't be a normal period. during a period the lining of the uterus sheds since a fertilized egg did not ""stick"". so if a full blown period starts. my guess would be that your not pregnant since your period flushes everything out."	peroid is 2 days late had sex day before my period was going to start will i start if i'm pregnant? . i am having whitish discharge today.

most helpful answer i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's enough to deal with a well-functioning colostomy let alone a leaky one! my hunch is that you need to be re-fitted for a better-fitting wafer and bag system. your stoma (and the area around it) will change shape over the next few weeks or months as swelling from the surgery decreases. this changing shape means the wafer and bag system you were sent home with may not work forever. in fact you may find you need to be re-fitted several times over the next few months -- and even years later as you gain or lose weight (which we all do! ). i'd suggest you call your surgeon's office for assistance or to request a consultation with a wound ostomy continence (woc) nurse. he or she can help you find a colostomy bag system that works for you. best wishes!	leaking colostomy bag. i just had a colostomy. my bag keeps leaking around the seal/wafer. why?

i'm neither a guy nor a urologist but one thing i feel pretty confident saying is this: circumcised or not masturbation shouldn't hurt (or sting uncomfortably). of course the penis always swells when it's aroused. the swelling causes the penis to stay erect for penetration during sexual intercourse. if that's the type of swelling you're talking about then it's perfectly normal. if you're implying you experience an abnormal swelling other than a normal erection then that's worth investigating. i suggest you see a urologist to explain what's going on and find out if what you're experiencing is normal or is something that needs to be addressed. do not feel embarrassed consulting a urologist. they deal with questions like yours every day and will respond in a respectful and dignified way. you have a legitimate concern after all. take care! you need to use a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it is made just for guys who masturbate and both treats and prevents a number of skin issues down there. like soreness chafing dryness discoloration and even a loss of sensitivity. it is the best overall penis skin care product available. you can get it online. hope things get better.	18 year old guy uncircumcised virgin. my problem is that my penis gets swollen when i masturbate well the outer skin. i'm 18 uncircumcised and still a virgin. as i masturbate i could feel a mild sting on the skin and the outer skin of my penis gradually swells. and this happens every time. i don't masturbate too frequently and i don't do too rough so i don't understand why it would do that. and the swelling lasts a couple hours after i ejaculate. is this normal is there someone i can/should do?
